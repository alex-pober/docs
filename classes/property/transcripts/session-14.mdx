# Property - Session 14

## Transcript

Tamara Baghdasaryan: And I give it Gmail alert.

John Rogers: Alright, everyone, does anyone know where we left off last week?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I think you ran into the book, but you finished your… lecturing, I think.

John Rogers: That's right. Does anyone know what case we left off of?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I think I… the Ernst v. Condent, and maybe the Kendall v. Ernest?

John Rogers: Yeah, I think we did that one, right? Yeah. And then, did we do… Berg?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Interesting. I don't see it on my list.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Let me double check.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Alright, any questions?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): We didn't do Berg. We haven't done Berg yet.

John Rogers: Is there any questions?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Are we gonna get to some essays tonight, after the book?

John Rogers: Sure.

Yessenia Soria: Professor, have you had a chance to,

Yessenia Soria: Grade or review the… the practice essays?

John Rogers: Some I have, some I haven't.

John Rogers: I've been, really, really busy the past 2 weeks. I've been kind of off the grid.

John Rogers: So…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): It's all good, it's all good.

John Rogers: Well, I'm still truckin'.

dovenight: Is it the cases you're working with?

dovenight: Criminal cases.

John Rogers: Yeah, those criminal cases that I'm working with.

John Rogers: That was crazy.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Stay safe and healthy, man, coming into the holidays. Stay safe and healthy.

John Rogers: Hmm?

John Rogers: what holidays? Because… during… When you guys are on break, I get your exams.

John Rogers: And it sits on my…

John Rogers: dining room table, and it just sits there for a couple of days. It's a big stack of them.

John Rogers: And then I get the email that says, they're due in 2 weeks.

John Rogers: I had to go into grading them. So while you guys are enjoying yourself, I'm sitting here grading.

John Rogers: The worst part Of being an employee is grading.

John Rogers: the worst.

John Rogers: So I'm not happy. So I don't get a break.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You said you're gonna grade them a little easier, so it might be a little bit easier for you this time around.

John Rogers: I have a feeling that I'm going to grade very easy this final.

John Rogers: I scared the hell out of my evidence class last night.

John Rogers: some of the students in that class were in this class, and I just said.

John Rogers: I think that your property vinyl is the hardest in… 30 years.

John Rogers: It's hard. But it's not impossible hard, it's just very… detailed.

John Rogers: But I will drop so many hints that you won't realize what I am. Maybe you will, maybe you won't.

John Rogers: But… From last week till…

John Rogers: the last moment you hear me speak, I will be dropping a lot of hints. You just won't realize it.

John Rogers: Some will be obvious, some won't.

John Rogers: But you will be able to answer everything on it, No problem.

John Rogers: Let me just advise you this. There's a lot of call-to-questions, I think, on one of them.

John Rogers: There's a lot of calls to the question. I think they're, like, 6 or something like that? I don't know.

John Rogers: So, when you're… Writing it, just make sure you… you potentially could see facts, For an issue.

John Rogers: But it's not what it's asking you to write.

John Rogers: So just be careful.

John Rogers: So, if you see something, go, oh, that's what it is. But it's not asking you to discuss that.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: to just kind of… the exam is not as written in a way that is nothing like I've ever written.

John Rogers: So we can go over essays, but it's nothing like that.

John Rogers: I like to… to write exams that are vague and…

John Rogers: Kinda like, what is that? Who knows? I don't know.

John Rogers: This one is not so much like that, it's mostly just, what is it?

John Rogers: And kind of following along.

John Rogers: I think that there are maybe multiple directions to take, too, so I have to consider, like, if you go this way, or this way, or this way. So,

John Rogers: I have a feeling that I will be very lenient on migrating, okay?

John Rogers: So, as I said last week, just remember, okay, when you open your final, and if you have a heart attack, okay, if you have a heart attack.

John Rogers: It's okay.

John Rogers: I know you're having a heart attack.

John Rogers: I read it, and I said, my class is gonna have a heart attack. I know, I know it's hard. I know it's hard, okay?

John Rogers: But it's the exams that are really easy that you have to worry about.

John Rogers: The exams suck.

John Rogers: Are the ones that you should be more happy about.

John Rogers: Because if everyone falls on their face, hey, everybody falls on their face.

dovenight: Oh, that sounds scary.

John Rogers: You also have to, you also have to consider the fact that it is a take-home file.

John Rogers: So… Okay.

Yessenia Soria: But it's still scary.

John Rogers: It's scary. It is scary. It's okay, remember.

John Rogers: You will be able to answer Every.

John Rogers: single thing.

John Rogers: That comes up.

John Rogers: Hold on.

John Rogers: Yep.

John Rogers: Okay.

Yessenia Soria: So you've never tested this, so that means Nicholas lectures?

Yessenia Soria: he's never… You know, I'm over here, like, stressing.

Yessenia Soria: You know, doing the 3-hour mentor session, and then you come out with, like, it's something you've never tested?

Yessenia Soria: So, meanwhile, you're gonna have your stack of tests on your dining room table. I'm not gonna enjoy Thanksgiving, because I would be stressing about your grade.

John Rogers: Well, it's okay, because Thanksgiving, I'll still be studying.

John Rogers: So there's that.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, that's right, you're right, you're right.

Yessenia Soria: Well, I'm already stressing, and I haven't even seen your test.

John Rogers: It's okay. It's okay.

Yessenia Soria: understand. I stress.

John Rogers: It's okay. You're gonna be just fine. So attending mentor sessions is just fine. It's just… Just don't worry.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, do you mind giving as many, like, hints as possible right now? Because we're all ready to listen. So just feel free to just flow. We're here with you.

John Rogers: Trust me, I'm gonna drop so many hints, it's just up to you if you catch it.

Fatima Razavi: Can you do, like, a hand signal when it's, like, a hint we really need to pay attention to?

John Rogers: I'll make things sometimes obvious.

Fatima Razavi: I love that. You know, Professor Margiano says, like, the recording is my witness. If you want to use that, they're not gonna stop you. We'd really appreciate it. Anything.

John Rogers: The recording is my witness.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Fatima, I love it, laying it on nice and thick, this is great. Let's see what he does.

Fatima Razavi: You see all the emojis? We all want this with you.

Yessenia Soria: How many pages?

Yessenia Soria: each essay. Please be nice.

John Rogers: By the way, by the way,

John Rogers: That, as far as pages, this is funny.

John Rogers: Kind of.

John Rogers: I don't want to scare people, okay? It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, alright? It's okay, I should never have said anything.

John Rogers: But.

maddykoshkaryan: Too late for that.

John Rogers: The school gets mad at me every time,

John Rogers: It's finals time, because this is actually the smallest class I've had in years. Last year, it was, like, 80 students in my property class.

John Rogers: And I put my foot down, and I said, I need a cap.

John Rogers: I'm not doing more than, like, 35.

John Rogers: There's 42 here, whatever.

John Rogers: 41.

John Rogers: it was because I had a 15 pa… it was 15 pages per essence, it was 45 pages, and then multiply that by 80.

John Rogers: It was a huge stack. It was gonna break my dining room table.

dovenight: But you're popular.

John Rogers: I don't know what he just said. But…

dovenight: I said, you're popular.

John Rogers: Popular, that's right.

John Rogers: And… they got mad at me.

John Rogers: Because, it's hard for them to staple all the exams, because I request physical copies.

John Rogers: Your exam this time around…

John Rogers: It has a maximum page limit of 25 pages.

John Rogers: Per essay.

John Rogers: It doesn't necessarily mean you have to use all 25 pages.

John Rogers: So… .

Estephania Escobedo: Is there still 3 exams?

John Rogers: Yes, there'd be 3 essay questions.

John Rogers: One is not bad.

John Rogers: I dropped a hint last week.

John Rogers: And maybe I will tonight.

John Rogers: The other two essays are actually very similar, in my opinion.

John Rogers: So… But they're just kind of…

John Rogers: when I say it's nothing that has been tested, everything has been tested, we've lectured on, it's just in a different way, but you'll be fine. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

John Rogers: You will be ready, I promise you that.

Yessenia Soria: 25 pages? Okay, so it's 75 pages, then, if we were to use all of them. Another question. Are we going to be using the same book if we were to take for Part 2 with you?

John Rogers: If you make the mistake of taking me second semester.

Yessenia Soria: I am gonna make the mistake.

John Rogers: and I'm not fired, then yes, it will be the same book.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: I think second semester property's harder than first semester, in my opinion. It's double the amount of information. Double.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: Someone wants me to teach an earlier class next semester. Ain't happening, sorry.

John Rogers: Any questions before we dive in? It's okay, don't worry, you're gonna be just fine.

Yessenia Soria: I'm speechless, and… and… and…

Yessenia Soria: I think I'm gonna skip the tea and go for a shot of tequila or something.

John Rogers: I've been historically known to make…

John Rogers: Exams appear worse than they really are.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: Any other questions at all?

John Rogers: Nothing since we covered… since we… from what we covered so far?

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor, these finals aren't made to write in an hour, are they?

John Rogers: I, I think you can write… Each question in an hour.

Agnes Gholoonian: Wait, but you can't write 25 pages in an hour, you know what I mean? Like, there's just…

John Rogers: But it doesn't mean that we are expecting 25 pages.

Agnes Gholoonian: We just have that limit.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: 25 pages per… per prompt, or total the 3 prompts? Per essay.

John Rogers: Hold on, hold on, hold on, let me clarify this.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Because I think Torts does the same thing. It's 8 pages per.

John Rogers: hate.

John Rogers: Hmm…

John Rogers: Wait, hold on.

John Rogers: I don't understand the…

John Rogers: I don't understand it. It doesn't make sense. I gotta… I have to get that revised.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: 25 pages sounds per question, sounds crazy, like, a lot.

John Rogers: It's either that, or it's 25 pages.

John Rogers: Total.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: total, for all.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: By the way, that'd be 3,000 pages, in comparison to, like, 1,000 if you had 80, so it's 15 per…

John Rogers: See, that's exa- and I read every exam twice, so see what kind of mood I'm in? I don't have a break, okay? I don't have a break. I did get these text messages from students, hey, how's grading?

John Rogers: Bad. I have to… Clarify that.

maddykoshkaryan: Professor, question. Are you reading what Patty sent?

John Rogers: What do you mean, what patty sent?

maddykoshkaryan: I mean, as far as the instructions for the pages.

John Rogers: No, I'm reading what we submitted to…

maddykoshkaryan: Oh, okay.

John Rogers: So, it's like when you open it up.

maddykoshkaryan: Cause it's, like, a general…

John Rogers: Someone said last year I had 8 pages per essay? For what class? Yes.

maddykoshkaryan: Towards.

John Rogers: I… I didn't have.

John Rogers: I didn't say 8 pages.

John Rogers: Let's pass, everyone.

John Rogers: just… I'll have the directions clarified, and I'll let you know. The other directions I won't tell you about, but that one I will, because the way that it's written is… I'm not sure of the page limit. I'm not sure if it's total or individual.

John Rogers: I'll clarify that, but make sure you read the directions, because if you don't follow the directions, so if you submit a single-spaced final.

John Rogers: I would love that. You know why?

John Rogers: Why would I lie?

dovenight: pages, those pages? Why are you gonna fail them?

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: Yes! I don't have to read it! I just go, F, move on.

John Rogers: You don't follow directions. You can't follow directions.

John Rogers: It's gotta be double-spaced. I hate double-spaced, but directions say double-spaced.

John Rogers: So make sure you follow the directions. Some years, I have students that get very cute. They get VERY cute, and they don't do double space, they do, like, 1.75.

John Rogers: And that means I have to go to…

John Rogers: Somewhere, and find a ruler to measure.

John Rogers: And it's not double-spaced.

John Rogers: gone. Not even gonna reach it.

Agnes Gholoonian: How can you tell if it's just a little bit?

John Rogers: Yeah, just a little bit, right? It's just a little bit, not different. Font, everything.

Yessenia Soria: I hugged.

John Rogers: And re-answered.

Yessenia Soria: I have some of your, A and B students' essays here.

Yessenia Soria: And they're, like, there's no spaces, and some of the fonts, I think they're, like, 18 or 16.

Yessenia Soria: And they got bees, and some of them are, like, 9. They're, like, really tiny.

John Rogers: Back in the olden days, when people took a real final exam.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, the real test, okay.

John Rogers: Those are the real finals.

John Rogers: I'll clarify that for you guys, because I think that should be clarified, it's not clear.

Yessenia Soria: Yeah, because it was 11… the most, I think, is 15 pages I see here on your finals. That's the real test, though.

John Rogers: The real test could be 155 pages, for all I care. They have one hour, so, I mean, whatever you want to write in one hour.

John Rogers: And please spell check, please make sure there's no spelling errors. Please make sure there's no spelling errors.

John Rogers: English is your second language, totally fine, don't care.

John Rogers: Please.

John Rogers: Use your spell check.

John Rogers: Please use spellcheck.

dovenight: There's 30%.

John Rogers: Excuse me?

dovenight: Are you gonna fail if there's spelling errors?

John Rogers: No, I'm not gonna fail, but I'm just not gonna be happy.

John Rogers: It's kind of like, if someone doesn't spell check.

John Rogers: and there's errors, it kind of tells me, like, when you grade it… Looks…

John Rogers: I don't get a lot of money teaching. In fact, I think I lose a lot of money.

John Rogers: And I don't get paid for grading. This is my own time.

John Rogers: I'm not very happy.

John Rogers: So, if it's like, you're submitting something to me with all these errors, I mean, I'm not supposed to hold that against you, but it's like…

John Rogers: How much time did you really…

John Rogers: Put in on this, you know?

John Rogers: So… I don't mean to scare anyone.

John Rogers: So I'll get that clarified. I'll get the, page… pages clarified.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Jude Seleck: Are you and Professor Domojian's class taking the same test?

John Rogers: Yes, same test.

John Rogers: Yeah, go to her review. If she has any more classes, reach out to her.

John Rogers: Crash it. Go in there, see what she says, see if she drops any hints.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: Look, if you're stressing, it's okay. I'm here to help you, okay?

John Rogers: You don't want to ask me questions during class? No problem.

John Rogers: You always call me.

John Rogers: I'll talk to you.

John Rogers: No problem, I'll help you out.

John Rogers: But you just gotta, you know, make that call.

John Rogers: Okay, so I guess we will jump into the material, since there's no questions.

John Rogers: Berg vs. Wiley.

John Rogers: Which is, minnesota.

John Rogers: Don't really care too much about going to Minnesota.

John Rogers: But,

John Rogers: Can anybody help me with the facts? Just kind of tell me what, the case is about?

John Rogers: You can.

John Rogers: Just what happened? That's all I care about. The facts.

Yessenia Soria: What page are we on?

John Rogers: Berg vs. Wiley, it's on page 518. In the middle of the page, it says Berg vs. Wiley. Berg v.

Mireya Gonzalez: Go ahead, Professor.

John Rogers: 518.

Mireya Gonzalez: I could go ahead.

John Rogers: Your Honor, go ahead.

Mireya Gonzalez: So, on November 11th of 1970, Wiley had executed a valid lease agreement.

Mireya Gonzalez: flooding land in a building in OSO, Minnesota, for use of a restaurant on a 5-year term beginning December 1st of 1970, and specify that the tenant to agree to bear all costs of repairs and remodeling, but must have prior written authorization from Wiley.

Mireya Gonzalez: The tenant must also operate the restaurant in a lawful and prudent manner, and Riley has the right to repossess if the tenant fails to meet the conditions.

Mireya Gonzalez: Berg took assignment of the lease from her brother, who had received consent from Riley to assign, starting May 1st of 1971, and opened a family affair restaurant.

Mireya Gonzalez: Where in 1973, she assigned her interest in the lease to her restaurant. On June 29th of 1973, Riley's attorney had sent a letter to Berg stating that she had breached

Mireya Gonzalez: And demanded that the 8 listed repairs be completed within 2 weeks.

Mireya Gonzalez: Or that Wiley would take possession. Wiley continued to remodel the restaurant without written consent from Wiley, and continued operations despite

Mireya Gonzalez: the alleged health code violations. On the last day of the two weeks' notice, Burge closed the restaurant, posted a closed four-remodeling sign. Later after, Wiley changed locks in Burg's absence without her knowledge.

John Rogers: Right.

John Rogers: So… What we are examining here is remedy of the landlord.

John Rogers: So, if you stop, Paying rent.

John Rogers: If you stop paying your \$6,000 a month.

John Rogers: For that place in Santa Monica.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: What remedy does your landlord have to try to get you out?

John Rogers: The common law rule was the landlord could use self-help.

John Rogers: Meaning, Jane Doe, John Doe.

John Rogers: John Rogers, you must vacate. Get out. I'm packing up your stuff, you're leaving.

John Rogers: The modern rules is that the landlord must resort to the judicial process. So the landlord, if you stop paying rent, the landlord says, hey, you owe me money!

John Rogers: The landlord must go to court.

John Rogers: Go through the eviction process and get a judicial order, ordering you.

John Rogers: To get out.

John Rogers: So the question here is, does this Minnesota court apply the common law?

John Rogers: Or modern principles.

John Rogers: Because it appears that it used, the common law.

John Rogers: And we first ask ourselves, did the landlord use self-help? Did the landlord enter?

John Rogers: Well, the landlord changed the locks.

John Rogers: Which this court, interpreted to be forced entry.

John Rogers: And then there's two additional reasons.

John Rogers: Why?

John Rogers: The modern law, and this court applied the modern law, why that is… comports better.

John Rogers: We did talk about it during lecture. The first is it avoids physical altercation.

John Rogers: If someone, invades your home.

John Rogers: Someone invades your home.

John Rogers: And says, get out.

John Rogers: It could potentially result in a physical altercation of some sort. It would be very problematic.

John Rogers: Especially if you have kids, or you're in the shower, or something like that.

John Rogers: It would be, in essence, an invasion of your privacy.

John Rogers: So the court respected that.

John Rogers: And that was one of the reasons why it says the modern principle is better.

John Rogers: The…

John Rogers: second or third, I think the first issue was, was forced entry, so the third. And if you can tell me, if anyone can.

John Rogers: Why… Does the court not apply the common law to this anymore?

John Rogers: Why would the court say modern principles are better?

John Rogers: For the third argument, does anybody know?

John Rogers: due process.

John Rogers: If the landlord physically excludes you, Then that violates your… procedural… due process rights. To contest

John Rogers: the reasons why you're not paying rent.

John Rogers: For example, there could be a sanitary issue, a habitability issue that you're not paying rent because it's maybe not safe, there's issues, the landlord's not correcting things.

John Rogers: And that would be a viable claim.

John Rogers: As a defense, in court.

John Rogers: So, if the landlord is permitted to just enter into your

John Rogers: \$6,000 apartment in Santa Monica and oust you.

John Rogers: Then you are being deprived of that right in court.

John Rogers: And that's why… The modern principle is better.

John Rogers: That's the intentions and spirit behind it.

John Rogers: So what we're extracting from this case is that a landlord, under modern law, can never use self-help to exclude a tenant. They must always resort to the judicial process.

John Rogers: For example, if you stop paying rent, I'm sure your landlord will serve you with a demand. Hey, pay me rent or vacate, and then if you don't, they initiate the eviction process.

John Rogers: Make sense?

John Rogers: Can anyone say it makes sense, or is everyone just quiet and saying it doesn't make sense?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): It does. It makes good sense.

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes, it makes sense.

Fatima Razavi: Will this concept be on the final?

John Rogers: I don't know if this would be on the final.

Fatima Razavi: Alright, thank you.

John Rogers: I know things we covered last week, on the final.

John Rogers: I know something I said last week is on the final.

John Rogers: Maybe I'll say it tonight, I don't know.

John Rogers: So, everybody gets it. Someone has their hand raised.

John Rogers: Or is it just waving?

John Rogers: Sabrina, are you waving at me, or you have your hand raised?

Sabrina Malekan: I was clapping.

John Rogers: Clapping? Okay.

John Rogers: I saw two students yesterday.

John Rogers: Former students of mine. One is a DA now, and one is a defense attorney. And it was wild. Wild, wild, wild. And both of them were, like, 10 years apart.

John Rogers: So, and they were getting along, and they didn't know. So I just saw them both in the same courtroom. It was wild! It was cool!

John Rogers: I was very mad because neither one of them told me they're doing criminal law. And I was like, how could you possibly do criminal law without letting me know of mad?

John Rogers: But it was a trip. It was a trip.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, that sounds really cool. Really, really cool.

John Rogers: Some I've seen that took me in the matrix, and I don't recognize them in person.

John Rogers: Don't know, because I only see them in the two-dimensional, not the three.

John Rogers: So I… Oh, you did? When? When did you take me?

John Rogers: If we go to note number, 1 on 523, this is common law. Under the common law, a landlord

John Rogers: A landlord entitled to possession could resort to self-help without fear of civil liability, so long as he or she used no more force than reasonably necessary. That's really the rule.

John Rogers: Criminal prosecution was nevertheless a possibility. I like that.

John Rogers: Interesting.

John Rogers: Note number 2, Berg, this case involved A commercial lease.

John Rogers: This is commercials.

John Rogers: So, when you see a final, you always really want to ask yourself, is this commercial or residential? Same rules apply. And note number two, what we're learning is, but the court's reasoning would appear to apply to all leases, residential and commercial alike.

John Rogers: So, BERG applies to both residential and commercial.

John Rogers: This is not really tested, but I thought this was interesting on note number 5, eviction. So, like, during the mortgage crisis.

John Rogers: Maybe some of you may have… We're just born.

John Rogers: a lot of people were renting, and what happens when the landlord couldn't pay their mortgage? The bank forecloses. So does that mean the tenants?

John Rogers: Are then forced to leave if they get an eviction notice.

John Rogers: Common law, such tenants were often out of luck. Under the common law, leave.

John Rogers: There is modern law that says that

John Rogers: Someone foreclosing must honor bona fide tenants.

John Rogers: So if you live in that \$6,000…

John Rogers: Santa Monica apartment that… that overlooks the… the water.

John Rogers: And the… the, the,

John Rogers: The landlord can no longer afford it.

John Rogers: The mortgage on the property. Do all the tenants have to leave? No. Tenants seem to be bona fide tenants.

John Rogers: So, the individual foreclosed… the person foreclosing must honor that.

dovenight: workload, the tenants can stay, or will they be.

John Rogers: The tenants can stay.

Mireya Gonzalez: Can you, go into what the main difference between the commercial and residential, like, what differentiates,

Mireya Gonzalez: them exactly.

John Rogers: That's a good question.

John Rogers: I really don't see any significant difference with the,

John Rogers: The only thing that I can think of…

John Rogers: would be implied warranty of habitability. It doesn't apply to commercial leases, only residential.

John Rogers: But… I don't think anyone's ever asked me that before.

John Rogers: So that's the only main difference.

dovenight: Imply have the ability only applies to residential, not commercial.

John Rogers: That's correct.

John Rogers: The rule that I gave you is in every residential lease.

John Rogers: Through the beginning of the rules in every residential lease.

John Rogers: I have been so tired this week, I'm so sorry if I'm not on it.

John Rogers: I've been driving so much.

John Rogers: I was downtown yesterday, and I finished at 9.01 in court, and I said, you know, do I just go back to my office and go home and then go to Woodland Hills, or should I go straight to Woodland Hills? So I said, you know what?

John Rogers: I'm gonna go home. So I went back home.

John Rogers: And then later drove to Woodland Hills. And then woke up this morning, I had to be back in downtown.

John Rogers: And then I got back today, and then tomorrow I have to be in Van Nuys.

John Rogers: Just a lot of driving. I'm not really happy, and it's on a Friday.

John Rogers: Questions on this case?

John Rogers: Interesting. I didn't really read up on this. The new edition of the book on 527, Evictions and the Pandemic.

John Rogers: What an absolute cluster.

John Rogers: What an absolute cluster.

John Rogers: People couldn't work, and then landlords didn't get rent.

John Rogers: And I think, wasn't it landlords didn't… couldn't collect rent for, like, a year or something?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): It was something like that.

John Rogers: How could they… they couldn't pay the lenders if they had a mortgage?

John Rogers: I don't know, that was, that sucks.

Gevorg Kulikyan: There was programs that paid them.

John Rogers: Paid the… paid the, landlords.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, but it took a long time to get the money. So for that amount of time, the landlord had to just keep paying the mortgage.

Gevorg Kulikyan: And then they got bag pay for it, though.

John Rogers: But what happens if the landlord doesn't have a lot of money and has to pay it up front? What are they gonna do?

Gevorg Kulikyan: At that point, you just have to make a deal with the lender.

John Rogers: Oh, no deal. You just, you know, pay us, and whatever.

John Rogers: We'll just ruin your credit.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: We'll just ruin your credit.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Thanks, COVID.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Okay, summer versus… I think I pronounce it as Credel?

John Rogers: But, I don't know.

John Rogers: Somer, Sommer vs. Crittle.

John Rogers: Friedel. This, is in Supreme Court of New Jersey. Has anyone been to New Jersey?

Fatima Razavi: I have.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, I was just there in June.

John Rogers: Yeah, I've been there twice this year on a case I have out there. Newark. I was in New York, New Jersey.

Fatima Razavi: Same, same, same.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah.

John Rogers: And… All I have to say is this.

John Rogers: The food is awful.

John Rogers: Awful. I asked the people at the hotel, I asked everyone around, name me the 5 best restaurants in all of New Jersey.

John Rogers: I went to all of them. They were terrible, and the service is terrible. Everything is terrible.

John Rogers: And no one will ever be able to change my mind.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): You're not wrong. You're not wrong at all.

Fatima Razavi: The food is terrible, that's why you should just go to New York.

John Rogers: Awful.

John Rogers: Awful. Yeah, you go to New York for food.

John Rogers: But we're.

dovenight: It's a farmland. I mean, they grow things. Is that terrible?

John Rogers: Farmland?

dovenight: They have farms and stuff, I mean, part of it.

John Rogers: I didn't see any farms, I saw a lot of homeless people, you know, going to the bathroom on the street, and all kinds of stuff like that.

dovenight: Were you near the… were you near the border of New York and New Jersey?

John Rogers: I don't know where I was, but I don't ever care about going back.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Newark is horrible. This is really shithole.

John Rogers: It's bad. I don't… I don't like it.

John Rogers: So I might have to go back, but anyways.

John Rogers: Summer versus… I say… Criddle? Cradle?

John Rogers: But… Can someone just tell me what happened? What were the facts?

John Rogers: No?

John Rogers: No one can?

Avi Omrany: Crittle signed a 2-year lease for an apartment, but never moved in.

Avi Omrany: Before the lease began, he wrote to the landlord, who was Sommer, explaining that his engagement had ended, and that he could no longer afford the rent, asking to terminate the lease. The landlord refused and kept the apartment vacant for 15 months, then sued him for full rent.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So this is interesting.

John Rogers: The question is… When a landlord

John Rogers: Stops paying… or when the tenant stops paying rent.

John Rogers: Is there any obligation and duties on part of the landlord?

dovenight: So…

John Rogers: If you've meant… that \$6,000 a month place in Santa Monica.

John Rogers: And you signed a 12-month lease, that's…

John Rogers: \$72,000 a year. And you only pay \$6,000 the first month, and then you say, I don't really want to pay the rest.

John Rogers: is… And you leave.

John Rogers: Does the landlord have any obligation or duty to do anything?

John Rogers: So, here's a question.

John Rogers: Landlord-tenant… Historically has been, this is 1977, real property law.

John Rogers: But… The issue of duty to mitigate is a contracts.

John Rogers: Principle.

John Rogers: So, hmm.

John Rogers: Real property and contracts are different.

John Rogers: So, should the duty to mitigate be applied under real property principles?

John Rogers: This court said, Yes.

John Rogers: Why?

John Rogers: Well, this is real property class.

John Rogers: We're dealing with dirt.

John Rogers: But… There is a lease agreement.

John Rogers: And the lease agreement.

John Rogers: Is analyzed and enforced.

John Rogers: Under contracts law.

John Rogers: And a breach or violation, the same contract rules apply.

John Rogers: And under contract law, we learn you…

John Rogers: Probably second semester contracts, if you guys are in first semester right now.

John Rogers: Is that upon a breach of a contract.

John Rogers: There's an obligation to mitigate the loss.

John Rogers: And since this case involves a contract, The lease agreement.

John Rogers: The duty to mitigate, then, applies.

John Rogers: So, what we are extracting from this case… is… Once a tenant breaches, abandons, Whomever.

John Rogers: And stops paying rent.

John Rogers: Let's just say abandoned.

John Rogers: The landlord, under the majority view.

John Rogers: Has an obligation to use reasonable efforts to locate a new tenant.

John Rogers: Failing to use reasonable efforts.

John Rogers: Would mean that the landlord cannot collect.

John Rogers: So if the landlord just puts their feet up and says, hey, you owe me rent, and I'm gonna watch, you know.

John Rogers: 20 seasons over and over and over again of Game of Thrones and do nothing.

John Rogers: They can't collect.

John Rogers: They actually must use reasonable diligence to locate a new tenant. If you fail to do that.

John Rogers: They cannot collect from the breaching abandoned… the tenant who abandoned.

John Rogers: Interestingly, does the duty to mitigate apply to

John Rogers: Commercial leases. I believe this is a residential lease.

John Rogers: There are subsequent cases, and I don't know if it's a footnote or if it's in the notes.

John Rogers: But it does… subsequent cases to this applies the duty to mitigate to commercial leases. Okay, so this applies to both commercial and residential.

John Rogers: So, prior to this case, landlords were permitted to keep their premise vacant.

John Rogers: And, in essence, not do anything.

John Rogers: And sue the tenant for… Pursue the defaulting tenant for back rent.

John Rogers: So… Questions?

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes, I have a question. So you said duty to mitigate applies to both commercial and residential. I just want to make sure I heard that correctly.

Mireya Gonzalez: That is correct. Thank you.

John Rogers: Let's get cute, though.

John Rogers: What happens, okay?

John Rogers: Yes.

Avi Omrany: So, is the mitigation just completely applies the same way contracts does. Let's say it was a \$6,000 lease and he managed to get someone for \$5,000, so then, if he sues, the tenant would just be responsible for the \$1,000 difference to make him whole?

John Rogers: Correct.

Avi Omrany: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: I forgot what I was gonna say.

John Rogers: I… I had some issues with this, because I try to get creative. So what happens if… a tenant…

John Rogers: abandons the \$6,000 a month Santa Monica apartment, okay?

John Rogers: I'm out.

John Rogers: I'm moving to Florida, because it's better.

John Rogers: And… The place gets vandalized.

John Rogers: Because the tenant's not home?

John Rogers: Who should bear that cost?

John Rogers: Now, if the landlord uses reasonable efforts, I could see collection of… Rent that's due.

John Rogers: But…

John Rogers: I just think that an issue arises of who bears the cost of vandalized property.

John Rogers: I don't know. I have no idea. It's not on your final, I'll tell you it's not on your final, it's just a thought process that I have.

John Rogers: Just to get you thinking, wait a second, who does bear that cost? Who's responsible for that?

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: Sounds like a pretty good research assignment, if you ask me.

John Rogers: Questions?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: If it takes the landlord, like, let's just say he…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: he has a duty to mitigate. It takes him, like, 3 months to find somebody. Can he go back and get those 3 months?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: from the old… Tenant.

John Rogers: Yes, of course, as long as they're using reasonable efforts, and they can't find someone for 3 months, then yeah, they can collect that 3 months, absolutely.

John Rogers: Now, can…

John Rogers: I'm wondering, and I don't know the answer to this either, what happens if the lease agreement contains a provision that says that there's no obligation for the landlord to mitigate?

John Rogers: I think a lot of things can be solved, so long as it's a provision in the lease agreement.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: I don't see any problem with including language in a lease agreement that says in the event that there is an abandonment.

John Rogers: the landlord is under no obligation to mitigate. I don't think that that's unreasonable. Usually for contracts, you can always contract your way out of doing anything.

John Rogers: Just include the term.

John Rogers: I don't know the answer to your question. How did someone vandalize it? Wouldn't it be…

John Rogers: Would… wouldn't the landlord lock it up? I assume. I don't know, I was just getting creative.

John Rogers: I assume I'll lock it up, but how do you lock it up?

John Rogers: If, in the interim, between someone abandoning it, And… a judicial order.

John Rogers: Can't.

John Rogers: People have their hand raised.

Avi Omrany: I could go first. One other question…

Avi Omrany: For mitigation, let's say, for example, he couldn't…

Avi Omrany: get the lease signed for another 3 months. However, when he did sign, he leased it for more, and the aggregate came out to the same amount. So at the end of the year, he still got the same \$100,000 he would have, but he didn't… for 3 months, he was running dry. Could he still go after…

Avi Omrany: Anything? Or it's just because technically he's whole by the end of the contract, there's nothing to go after?

John Rogers: So you're saying that, for example, if it's a \$5,000 a month lease.

John Rogers: and tenant vacates, abandons it, I find someone willing to pay \$6,000. At the very end, I make my money back.

Avi Omrany: The same exact amount of money, but there was a, like, a dry period, essentially.

John Rogers: So, he had to pay, for example, the mortgage out of his own pocket. Sure, whatever out-of-pocket, fine, as long as they…

John Rogers: use reasonable diligence, the landlord did, they can pay. They can… they can collect.

Avi Omrany: So, at the end of the contract, if the landlord was made whole at the end.

John Rogers: Second con- hold on, the second contract?

Avi Omrany: At the second contract, yeah. The landlord got everything he would have made.

Avi Omrany: But there was still a dry period. Like, for example, instead of \$5,000 for a year, 6 months later, he got \$10,000 for 6 months. But for 6 months, he didn't make any money. Can he go after him still, as a time period? Or it's only…

John Rogers: What's the landlord's loss?

Avi Omrany: the income over time, I guess?

John Rogers: Well, over time, they got their money back.

Avi Omrany: Yeah, but for 6 months, he had to pay the mortgage out of pocket instead of using the monthly lease.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Maybe the intros, the interest would…

John Rogers: fine, interest, fine, whatever you guys want, but I don't see what the damages are.

Avi Omrany: Okay.

John Rogers: I don't see the damages.

John Rogers: If the landlord was made whole, landlord's been made whole, through mitigation.

John Rogers: Yes.

Mireya Gonzalez: Going back to where you said the provision.

Mireya Gonzalez: If the landlord has that provision, are they still able to collect?

John Rogers: I would think so.

Mireya Gonzalez: rent?

John Rogers: I don't think it's unreasonable, in my opinion, to have a clause in a lease agreement that says the landlord is under no duty to mitigate.

John Rogers: It's something contemplated by the parties. The only thing that you cannot

John Rogers: You cannot contract out of is habitability.

John Rogers: That's just implied in every lease.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Would the duty to mitigate… you said you could put it… you would be able to put it in a contract, what if you're in a majority district?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Our major… because it says the minority of the…

John Rogers: Well, that's… that's kind of a,

John Rogers: This is when the contract is silent on that part.

John Rogers: what is the currency of the law? But if you include it as a contemplated term, I see no problem with it.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

John Rogers: Alright, you guys are smart. My class is perfect.

John Rogers: Perfect, I think you guys are perfect.

John Rogers: Landlord's remedies and Security Devices.

John Rogers: This tells you what the remedies of the landlord are.

John Rogers: Maybe you could read that page to yourself.

John Rogers: Quiet enjoyment and constructive eviction.

John Rogers: This is a cookie-cutter case, in my opinion. The reason I like it is because it affected evidence in criminal cases, because…

John Rogers: Evidence against the accused was spoiled or damaged.

John Rogers: And there's only a few people that would be happy in that situation, and who would be happy?

John Rogers: You. That's correct! I would be happy! I would be happy, because that means cases get dismissed.

John Rogers: That is a 1200 IQ answer. Brilliant.

John Rogers: This is a cookie cutter.

John Rogers: Case.

John Rogers: Do you, does anybody wish to volunteer to read just what the facts are?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Is this one, Village Commons?

John Rogers: Yeah.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, I can do it.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Got them all sitting here.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Pull it out.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Okay, so this was in… 2008.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): There's a lease agreement from 1999 to 06.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Prosecutor… oh, wow. Prosecutor's office leased a 9,000 and some change square foot basement for evidence storage and office use. Rent went from \$0 to \$8,500 and some change a month. Lease required landlord to maintain the structure.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): There was an exclusive remedy clause that said tenant could sue for damages or injunction, but could not terminate, withhold, or abate the rent.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): There was a… there was a water intrusion from 01 to 03, multiple leaks, landlord repeatedly patched up, never solved the problem, there was some mold, mold testing.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): There was some coughing, headaches, allergies developed with some of the, people. Landlord declined professional mold remediation, there was worsening conditions in 02, a pipe burst, destroying boxes of evidence. Yay! Tenant left…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): What's that?

John Rogers: No, go ahead.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Oh.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I attended left in 03,

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Citing health and safety hazards, they paid rent through 03, stopped paying rent thereafter. The bounce was some… wow.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): \$380,000 and some change.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Landlord sued in 04 for the unpaid rent. Prosecution's office counterclaimed, asserting constructive eviction.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I'm saying actual eviction took place on… in 02, construction eviction in 03.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And, trial court found that the prosecution's office both actually and constructively evicted, and the landlord failed to mitigate damages.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: If we go on page 545, right in the middle.

John Rogers: The general rule, it's in quotes right in the middle, the general rule is that the tenant will be relieved from any obligation to pay for the rent if the landlord deprives the tenant of possession and beneficial use and enjoyment of any part

John Rogers: of the demised premises by actual eviction. Stated differently, after termination.

John Rogers: The lease and all liability under it for future rent are extinguished.

John Rogers: If we go below that, It talks about constructive eviction, right there. If an act or omission

John Rogers: by the lessor materially deprives the lessee of the beneficial use or enjoyment of the lease property. The lessee may elect to abandon the property and avoid further obligations under the lease.

John Rogers: If the lessee so elects.

John Rogers: The abandonment of the property must occur within a reasonable time after the act or omission.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, can anyone tell me, why didn't the prosecutor's office claim habitability? Wasn't there mold issues, and wasn't there, like…

John Rogers: health issues going on? Why would they not bring that claim?

John Rogers: Can you observe?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Commercial?

John Rogers: Commercial, that's right! They can't! It's a commercial lease, they can't! So it can only be constructive eviction.

John Rogers: So, what is required for constructive eviction? This jurisdiction doesn't appear to have a partial eviction. It's either actual or constructive. Totally fine.

John Rogers: So we're going to analyze this only under constructive eviction.

John Rogers: So, was there a substantial interference on, the lessee?

John Rogers: Was their use and enjoyment of the property, of the premises, interfered with? What happened? There was a lot of leaks, right?

John Rogers: Their evidence spoiled, it was damaged.

John Rogers: The whole purpose of this lease

John Rogers: is for them to store evidence, right? To prosecute people?

John Rogers: Is that right?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Guys sure was.

John Rogers: Yeah, that sure is.

John Rogers: So there have been problems. Did I miss anything? I think that there were some mold issues, though it's a sanitary habitability issue. You can still argue that section under substantial interference, obviously.

John Rogers: Is there anything I'm missing? What else was the issue? Any other issues? They were told not to use a specific room? Yeah, just don't use that room, otherwise you're fine.

John Rogers: Wait a minute, what? It's like, just don't use your bathroom.

John Rogers: Go in the kitchen sink.

John Rogers: Oh, okay, no problem.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, I think that's crazy, their war room was underneath the sidewalk, which continually flooded from the sewer and storm drains, and they said, yeah, don't bother using that room. I'm like, okay, what…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Sounds pretty horrible.

John Rogers: Yeah, just don't use the room. Oh, okay, that's like the equivalent of, like I said, you have this one-bedroom Santa Monica \$6,000 a month apartment, and your landlord says, sorry about the toilet, just don't use it anymore.

John Rogers: Okay… You just go in the sink.

John Rogers: Was there notice to the landlord?

John Rogers: Well, there were multiple complaints over a period. I think, if I'm not mistaken, almost a year.

John Rogers: more, I think?

John Rogers: I think it was almost 2 years of constant issues in notifying the landlord of issues.

John Rogers: almost 2 years, because I'm looking at what?

John Rogers: January 22?

John Rogers: 2002?

John Rogers: Landlord filed the complaint February 23, 2004.

John Rogers: So this is a period going on for quite some time, so the analysis here is, was the landlord placed on notice of the issues? Well, for one, the landlord's saying, don't use one of the rooms. So I think that's a pretty strong indication that they are on notice of there being problems.

John Rogers: And did the tenants vacate? Sure. This office just got up, had enough, and vacated. They were not there.

John Rogers: So this is a cookie-cutter constructive eviction claim.

John Rogers: This is the only case we provided for constructive eviction.

John Rogers: I wish I had a case with these prosecutors.

John Rogers: To get my case dismissed.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I think I brought this… oh, sorry.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I was gonna ask that… I brought this up before, again, if we have a conversation in an essay about constructive eviction, we do bring up abandonment before.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Or no?

John Rogers: Potentially. Yeah, because the… well, I mean, the person cannot be there. You can't actually succeed on a claim if the tenant is still on the premises.

John Rogers: So yeah, mention abandonment.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Talk about that, and then go into, like, a constructive eviction after that?

John Rogers: After, before, my response to that is just listen to your heart.

John Rogers: Oh, this was in Indiana.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, and it still says that this is the leading case authority on it.

John Rogers: Weird, because it's in Indiana. What's in Indiana?

John Rogers: Man, you gotta think about that one, huh?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I'm from Indiana, I mean, I can go on, there's a lot of stuff in Indiana, but, sports, I mean, if you want to get down to the…

John Rogers: I'm… I'm sorry you're from Indiana.

John Rogers: Not that I… I'm… not that I'm bad-mouthing Indiana, I'm just sorry that you're from there.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Preach.

John Rogers: No, I'm kidding. I've never been to Indiana.

John Rogers: So I can't really talk very much trash on.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): It's not horrible, but it's not California.

John Rogers: there's no beaches, right? There's no waves, no beaches.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): No, nothing. Just a horrible winter. A humid summer.

dovenight: It's near Chicago.

John Rogers: It's near Chicago, but Chicago during the winter ain't very fun.

John Rogers: Questions about this case?

John Rogers: None of y'all got a question.

John Rogers: About this case.

John Rogers: And you feel comfortable about constructive eviction.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor, can you define constructive eviction one more time for me, please?

John Rogers: When you say define it, what do you mean?

Agnes Gholoonian: Can you go through the elements? Like, what is necessary for constructive eviction?

John Rogers: Who do you think is necessary?

Agnes Gholoonian: Please don't ask me that. There's a reason why I'm asking you, it's because I don't know.

John Rogers: There has to be a substantial interference.

John Rogers: Notice to the landlord.

John Rogers: Then the tenant must vacate.

dovenight: The basic thing is that landlord interfere with the tenants.

dovenight: Quite enjoyment, you know?

dovenight: Sweetened.

John Rogers: Excuse me?

dovenight: The landlord interfered with the tenant's, Ability to live in the… In a, in a,

dovenight: an apartment.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

Agnes Gholoonian: Is there any point where the…

Agnes Gholoonian: contract that was signed with, like, a tenant, I'm not talking about commercial, with a tenant and a landlord. Like, in a case of…

Agnes Gholoonian: Like, it's a serious case of, like, causing health issues.

Agnes Gholoonian: Would the contract be void? Even if, like, let's say the contract is ironclad?

Agnes Gholoonian: Is there any way that you can surpass a contract? Like, for example, let's say if I'm living in an apartment that I'm renting, and there's mold, and I have signed a contract with them, like a 90-page contract that

Agnes Gholoonian: Prevents any type of responsibility on the…

Agnes Gholoonian: owner of the building. Am I still able to get out of that contract if it's, like, something that's serious to my health?

John Rogers: I'm very curious, can you be a little bit more specific with that question? And you said it's a 90-page ironclad thing, but…

Agnes Gholoonian: Yeah.

John Rogers: Is there a provision in there?

John Rogers: That you said, what? I wanna know.

Agnes Gholoonian: Let's say if there's a provision in there that prevents any type of responsibility on the landlord.

Agnes Gholoonian: if anything goes… like, if I'm signing a 12-month lease, like, I'm stuck in this lease, but I didn't know that there was mold inside the apartment, and, you know, let's say I'm month 3 in, and there's… I find that there's mold.

Agnes Gholoonian: And… but this contract is keeping me in there, and it's saying, like, okay, landlord is not responsible for fixing any mold, or any type of thing. Am I still able to get out of it and say, I didn't know that there was mold in this building, I want to get out?

John Rogers: So… The landlord is refusing to fix something, and it's a habitability issue.

John Rogers: and the tenant is saying, what do I do? Because I signed this lease saying that.

Agnes Gholoonian: they're not responsible.

John Rogers: That's unenforceable.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay.

John Rogers: Landlord can't contract.

John Rogers: I think it's the third time I've said this, too. Might be important.

John Rogers: The landlord cannot contract their way out of.

John Rogers: Habitability.

John Rogers: It's implied in every lease.

John Rogers: So, interesting question, though, because I actually tested on this. The first year I started teaching.

John Rogers: My first final exam, which I actually look back and taught was pretty hard.

John Rogers: In fact, I think it was Professor Zolfugari's final exam, if I'm not mistaken.

John Rogers: Yeah, not long ago.

John Rogers: There was mold.

John Rogers: Existing.

John Rogers: At the time of release.

John Rogers: So the question I was looking for students to think about.

John Rogers: Was, if it's bad mold, for example.

John Rogers: And the premises should not and cannot legally be rented out to someone based on its condition.

John Rogers: is… the… lease… illegal.

John Rogers: the lease… On its own express terms.

John Rogers: Is not saying, yes, lease my apartment.

John Rogers: To cook meth.

John Rogers: That, on its face… would be illegal.

John Rogers: But this is kind of more… Kind of a… A latent violation.

John Rogers: Because it's,

John Rogers: If the premises cannot be leased legally because of a habitability issue, then it should not have been able to be leased.

John Rogers: And I certainly think that puts an unfair bargaining power on the landlord, especially if a new tenant was not made aware of that.

John Rogers: So I would think that you could have an argument to say that the lease

John Rogers: is illegal.

John Rogers: Does that make sense?

Agnes Gholoonian: What if some, like, let's say a neighbor is cooking meth, and obviously the landlord is unaware?

Agnes Gholoonian: Through the air vents, the meth, you know, goes through all these different apartments.

Agnes Gholoonian: Would the… with the other tenants?

Agnes Gholoonian: The ones that are not cooking meth. Have an ability to get out of their agreement.

John Rogers: Well, you're getting free meth, so why are you complaining?

John Rogers: Not everybody wants remeth, I don't know.

Agnes Gholoonian: You know…

John Rogers: It's free meth.

Agnes Gholoonian: Custom.

Agnes Gholoonian: Very productive apartment complex.

John Rogers: I…

John Rogers: If it could be controlled by the landlord, sure, because that could constitute a nuisance.

John Rogers: as well.

John Rogers: If it can be controlled by the landlord, yeah, you have a claim that this place is not habitable in light of the fact that this person's cooking mess.

John Rogers: Find me a jury that wouldn't… that would disagree with me.

John Rogers: You wanna be… ingesting meth flames all day. Some people would. I mean, I don't know.

Agnes Gholoonian: But that's not something I think a landlord would control, if it's, like, an uncontrollable thing for the landlord.

John Rogers: But an uncontrollable thing, if a neighboring tenant In the same apartment complex?

John Rogers: The landlord has control of that.

John Rogers: It would be different if it's a separate property, like your next-door neighbor, that's an entirely different piece of property.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay, so if, for example, if I was a tenant, and I'm looking at a situation like that, I would say, okay.

Agnes Gholoonian: I… if I kick out that one tenant that's cooking meth or whatever, he gets arrested. But what about all the other tenants? Let's say, like, the other 4 or 5 tenants that have been

Agnes Gholoonian: ingesting this meth without their knowledge, or…

Agnes Gholoonian: you know, would I… would I still be responsible for somewhat compensating these other tenants?

John Rogers: If you're the landlord.

Agnes Gholoonian: If you're the… if I'm the landlord.

John Rogers: That's a separate cause of action. That would be kind of a torts claim.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay.

John Rogers: The only issue, though, is habitability. And I'm sure that if there's a habitability issue and someone is affected and impacted by it, sure, they could sue for damages. Damages are beyond the scope of this class, but I'm sure they can, absolutely.

Agnes Gholoonian: But would they be able to get out of their lease agreement?

John Rogers: Oh, God, yeah, sure, why not? Yes, if this is a… if the premises is deemed not habitable, I'm out.

John Rogers: I don't wanna… I don't wanna inhale meth.

John Rogers: during weekdays.

John Rogers: I don't want to be inhaling meth.

John Rogers: So… Sure.

John Rogers: I think they can absolutely get out of the lease.

Sennett Devermont: I had a question, Professor. In the scenario where the tenant moves in, and the land… and there's, mold.

Sennett Devermont: In the unit that the landlord knows about.

John Rogers: Okay.

Sennett Devermont: And you were mentioning illegal lease. I have in my notes, if the tenant doesn't know, then there was no meeting of the minds, and it's not an illegal lease.

Sennett Devermont: So really, if the tenant didn't know that there was mold.

Sennett Devermont: beforehand, then it wouldn't be an illegal lease, but I… but in your example, were you saying that the tenant did know about, like, toxic mold, and it was, like, agreeing to that, and that's why it would be an illegal lease?

John Rogers: I would think…

John Rogers: I'll have to double-check that then, because here's the thing, if a premises is not habitable by law.

John Rogers: I don't think whether the tenant knew or didn't know about it is not really a relevant factor.

John Rogers: The premises cannot be habitable. It cannot be leased out to someone.

John Rogers: So it would be based on an illegal lease.

John Rogers: So I'll double-check that, because it just… What… the tenant's knowledge

John Rogers: It's not a relevant factor, in my opinion.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Is it because the mold will just be… it's a code violation, so it's…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Right there, just make it whatever person will go into the lease is going into an illegal lease.

John Rogers: Yeah, that's… that's… that was my rationale for it.

John Rogers: Housing code violation, and the lease is… is based on a premises that has a housing code violation on it.

John Rogers: Her honor.

Mireya Gonzalez: As far as for constructive… you may have touched on it in… when we went over the last case. Are we able to have constructive eviction, but also partial eviction? Like, will we ever get that scenario?

John Rogers: You know, I stopped teaching partial eviction years ago, but it's in my notes.

John Rogers: So… It's in my notes, but I don't test on it.

John Rogers: And I've been meaning to get rid of it.

John Rogers: But you're not going to have to write partial eviction anywhere on your final.

John Rogers: I still get students that, that's still right about it?

John Rogers: It's fine. It's no problem. I just really don't teach it anymore.

John Rogers: If that makes sense.

John Rogers: Kind of, maybe?

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes, thank you.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, I have a quick question, I'm so sorry.

Gevorg Kulikyan: This is about mitigating.

Gevorg Kulikyan: In, like, the pursuit of mitigating, is the landlord required to lower their standards for the type of tenant

Gevorg Kulikyan: they acquire.

John Rogers: lower their standards? No, I don't think there's any requirement of a lower standard.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, like, let's say the potential tenants that they're… that are interested in the property have, like, a credit score of 640 when he requires a 680.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Is he required to… Bring in that tenant with the 640.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So he can mitigate the losses of the…

John Rogers: That's really interesting.

John Rogers: Because… Part of mitigation is filing a qualified tenant.

John Rogers: So, if the person doesn't have the type of credit that,

John Rogers: I guess would be reasonable, maybe?

John Rogers: I guess the landlord can decline it, so long as the landlord is acting reasonable.

John Rogers: Because technically, you can find a tenant to pay a dollar a month.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: So it's like, that's… this doesn't sound reasonable.

John Rogers: And if the law were written in that way.

John Rogers: unreasonable in a way, then no one would want to lease anything out. We wouldn't really have landlords, no one would want to rent out property, because…

John Rogers: It would just be so incredibly unfair.

John Rogers: So, I think that as long as the…

John Rogers: But at the same time, it's on a case-by-case basis, because look.

John Rogers: Someone can have… someone could have…

John Rogers: \$100 million in their bank account, but have a bad credit score.

John Rogers: Versus someone could have an 850 credit score.

John Rogers: But maybe not make a lot of money?

John Rogers: So, I guess it's… The answer is, I don't know. I'm just trying to…

John Rogers: think what I believe to be reasonable.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, like, if the requirement is unreasonable, then maybe it won't hold up for the mitigation claim.

John Rogers: Yeah, it's… I guess it's as long as it's reasonable.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Makes sense.

John Rogers: Turns someone down that's got \$100 million.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: Ace.

John Rogers: I have no idea.

John Rogers: I am not a landlord.

John Rogers: Though I was thinking about it.

John Rogers: I mean, I could live, honestly, in a van and be happy.

John Rogers: I could live in a van and be totally happy, totally fine, wouldn't care. Because I have a lot of space that I don't even use.

dovenight: Really?

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: So, I could just rent my house out and live in a van. I wouldn't… I wouldn't really care.

John Rogers: So… Maybe I should do that.

John Rogers: Teach class from… from the car.

John Rogers: And equals.

Yessenia Soria: I brought her home.

John Rogers: That motorhome would be really cool.

Yessenia Soria: They have some nice ones, too.

John Rogers: I'm sorry, you had a question?

Yessenia Soria: I said, they have really nice waterfalls.

John Rogers: A really nice motorhome, yeah.

John Rogers: Or live in that, one-bedroom apartment in Santa Monica.

John Rogers: Any questions for me at all by anything? Anyone scared, wants something to say, etc, etc?

dovenight: I'm scared, but I don't have nothing to say.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Hold on a second, let me see something.

John Rogers: Whoa, who's that…

John Rogers: So, what we can do is we can take a break. We have…

John Rogers: We could do one of two things.

John Rogers: Let's take a break.

John Rogers: We'll do… we'll come back, we'll do one case, the last case, which should be very quick.

John Rogers: And then, if you want, we can go over an essay if you want.

John Rogers: Sound good?

Ravinder Ghuman: Yes.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Great.

John Rogers: Take a break.

Mireya Gonzalez: Suggest an essay?

John Rogers: Yeah, suggest one. Whatever you want.

Mireya Gonzalez: 16 would be great.

John Rogers: Alright, we'll do 16.

Mireya Gonzalez: Sorry.

Mireya Gonzalez: 17.

John Rogers: Excuse me?

Mireya Gonzalez: I meant 17.

John Rogers: Doesn't matter, I don't care. Whatever you guys want to do, we'll do.

Yessenia Soria: We'll be back at 8.05 or 8.10?

John Rogers: 8.05, that's in 7 minutes.

Yessenia Soria: Oh, okay, so…

John Rogers: obligated to give you a 15-minute break, and then let you out 15 minutes early, because for every hour, you get a 10-minute break.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, alright, sounds good.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Professor?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Can I ask you a question?

John Rogers: Yeah.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: essay that they chose to do, do you think that's going to be helpful for us for our final?

John Rogers: Any essay is gonna be helpful for your final.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Okay.

John Rogers: Someone sent me an essay in a private message.

John Rogers: Sure, go ahead and do it, but…

John Rogers: and everything you do is great. So if you sent me an essay privately.

John Rogers: My response is just, look, any of them should help you.

John Rogers: There's too many people trying to get…

John Rogers: Trying to poke at me to get inside information on the final.

John Rogers: I've already dropped something in your final since lecture.

John Rogers: I've said something.

John Rogers: So someone said 15, 16, 17, I don't know, what is it? What, what, what question was it again?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I think Mariah said 17, I think.

Mireya Gonzalez: 17, yeah.

John Rogers: It's Maria.

Mireya Gonzalez: Mariah…

John Rogers: It's Maria.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor, was the hint that you dropped have anything to do with the question I asked?

John Rogers: Maybe.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay.

Agnes Gholoonian: Can you blink twice if it is yes?

John Rogers: I can't say it. I can't say.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Is he a hostage now?

John Rogers: I know, you guys, I'm getting a lot of private messages from people, too.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): That's fantastic.

John Rogers: So, you don't want to do… this question 17 is not landlord-tenant, you want to do a…

John Rogers: a landlord… do you want to do this one? 17, not a landlord-tenant?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Conveyance, conveyance.

Mireya Gonzalez: Unless anyone wants to do it.

Leanna Badar: No, let's do a landlord-tenant one.

John Rogers: I'm happy to do this one. I don't care.

John Rogers: doesn't matter to me. I will go to sleep tonight, Fine.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: can't true.

Agnes Gholoonian: tenant one.

Agnes Gholoonian: Just based off of what we're learning today.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: I can… I can do question 17 as well. We can… look, you guys, I will go over a bunch of essays between now and your final.

John Rogers: Don't worry.

John Rogers: Bunch of them.

John Rogers: I'll also have a review on Saturday. I will have one.

John Rogers: Saturday?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: We missed you this Saturday. We're very depressed. Everybody was depressed.

John Rogers: I wasn't depressed.

John Rogers: I was not depressed.

Yessenia Soria: What time will the review be on Saturday?

John Rogers: I don't know. In my email to everyone? Didn't know. I don't know if I actually included an email.

Yessenia Soria: I didn't get one.

John Rogers: It was just…

maddykoshkaryan: I think it said 10.

John Rogers: Something like that. Yeah, probably 10.30 or something, who knows? It's recorded.

Yessenia Soria: Because we have to do…

John Rogers: Before you start mentioning the sky is falling, and you have conflicts, it will be recorded.

Yessenia Soria: Okay…

John Rogers: So, do you want to do question 17? Doesn't matter, I'm not gonna make a decision. You guys make a decision.

Sennett Devermont: 17 looks good.

Yessenia Soria: Clotus 15.

Amir Akbari: Let's do 17.

Karen Hernandez: Yeah, let's just do 17.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Can everyone see this okay?

Karen Hernandez: Yes.

John Rogers: Question 17.

John Rogers: Fall 2015 final exam.

John Rogers: Oh, boy, who was in this class?

John Rogers: I had not the slightest clue who was in this class.

John Rogers: Oh, this class?

John Rogers: was all female students. I had a class, in person, of, like, 40-something students.

John Rogers: I was the only male in class, so everything was… sheet.

John Rogers: And that is what made he or she Born.

John Rogers: was this class.

John Rogers: But I did throw some males in this. I don't know…

John Rogers: be fine.

John Rogers: This is just a spin-off of another question.

John Rogers: Prior to 1990,

John Rogers: We are in the iPhone days, this is pre-iPhone.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: it means it's setting up… it has to be an adverse possession issue going on here, okay? Has to be.

John Rogers: I would be very surprised if there is not.

John Rogers: Owen, the owner, owned Blackacre in F. Simple, so first issue… B, simple, absolute.

John Rogers: in 1990, we don't know when in 1990, it's just in 1990. That was a long time ago, before many of you were even thought of.

John Rogers: O…

John Rogers: conveyed Blackacre by valid deed. It says valid deed to prevent the cowboys and cowgirls from questioning the validity of the deed. Okay, leave it alone.

John Rogers: to Ann and Bob, so A and B, jointly, With rights of survivorship.

John Rogers: for so long as neither Ann nor Bob sells alcoholic beverages on Blackacre otherwise to Rick.

John Rogers: Huh.

John Rogers: So… Y-you can,

John Rogers: Fine.

John Rogers: So I would look at it kind of like this. I would say a joint tenancy discussion.

John Rogers: Intent to create it.

John Rogers: And… jointly, Is an indication of intentions of creating a code… co-tenancy.

John Rogers: Combined with the language of right of survivorship, which only exists.

John Rogers: When a survivor… when a joint tenancy is created, it evidences owes intent to award full.

John Rogers: Ownership interest to the survivor.

John Rogers: of… Either Ann or Bob, whoever survives the longest, could be.

John Rogers: Joint tenancy discussion.

John Rogers: I used to teach my class that they had to discuss the four unities. I don't require that anymore, as far as modern principles, so I don't require it anymore. It's just the specific language intentions of creating it.

John Rogers: then it says, for so long as neither Ann nor Bob sells alcoholic beverages on Blackacre.

John Rogers: So… to Ann and Bob would be a fee. What kind of fee? It would be defeasible.

John Rogers: And what kind of the feasible fee it would be.

Amir Akbari: Executory limitation?

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Ricky.

John Rogers: Tricky.

Fatima Razavi: Would it, would it be in life?

Fatima Razavi: Because it's common law?

John Rogers: Where'd you get common law?

Fatima Razavi: Because this is prior to 1990?

John Rogers: And it's still… modern principles.

Fatima Razavi: How would we know that?

John Rogers: I mean, I did say iPhone.

Fatima Razavi: Yeah, it doesn't say iPhone on this, like, if we saw this on.

John Rogers: Look, if there was a VCR, let's say, if there was a VCR,

John Rogers: Someone could potentially have a VCR, Then, modern principles apply.

John Rogers: What's a VCR?

John Rogers: Modern principles apply.

dovenight: So if it's a VCR, we see that in the gym, we go, Modern Principles.

John Rogers: Yep, VCR equals modern principles.

John Rogers: I actually have an associate's degree in DCR repair.

John Rogers: What does Rick have?

Fatima Razavi: Exec… executory interest.

John Rogers: That is correct.

Fatima Razavi: Shifting?

John Rogers: Yeah.

Amir Akbari: quote, fee?

Fatima Razavi: So, if it said to Ann and Bob's and their heirs, then it would be common law.

Fatima Razavi: That would be one of the cues.

John Rogers: Well, I mean, it could suffice modernly, too.

Fatima Razavi: So, okay, I'm just gonna assume it's Modern Law, always. There's… is there, like, keywords that we can look for?

John Rogers: No.

Fatima Razavi: Okay.

John Rogers: I mean…

John Rogers: if it's fairly recent, within the past 40 years, just apply common law, okay? Or apply modern law.

John Rogers: Now…

John Rogers: Interesting about Rick's interest…

John Rogers: Rick has an executoratory interest in fee, okay?

John Rogers: So, rick's executor interest?

John Rogers: It's not going to last forever.

John Rogers: The maximum amount of time that Rick's executory interest will last for is how long?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Until he dies?

John Rogers: Right.

Amir Akbari: Until they, they don't sell alcoholic beverage over them.

John Rogers: So, here's the thing.

John Rogers: This provision doesn't say so long as alcoholic beverages is never sold. It says so long as neither A nor B sells.

John Rogers: An A nor B is not going to live forever, are they? Maybe they will! Maybe there'll be an invention that says that people can finally live forever.

Fatima Razavi: For the.

John Rogers: They are not…

Fatima Razavi: Bob.

John Rogers: They are not going to live forever, so although this is an executor interest and fee.

John Rogers: This will only last for the duration of the maximum time of Ann or Bob's life.

John Rogers: It doesn't say… So long as alcohol is never sold on Blackacre. If that's the case, then…

John Rogers: When A and or B dies, it goes to their errors, and then their errors, and then their errors.

John Rogers: This is very specific that it's Ann or Bob, nor Bob.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: So if they both die, and they're heirs… Their heirs, whoever succeeds.

John Rogers: We'll get fee, simple, absolute, no conditions, zero, everything's done. They don't, they don't get any, there's no conditions attached.

John Rogers: So this will only actually last for the duration of their life.

John Rogers: Consequently…

dovenight: this,

John Rogers: terrific.

John Rogers: Yeah?

dovenight: So I've been saying, as long as alcohol and beverages is not sold on Black hair, then it goes to their heirs?

John Rogers: Yes, then their heirs, or whomever survives A and B, their heirs will,

John Rogers: will be subject to that restriction as well, but in this case, it's only Ann or Bob.

John Rogers: It's not.

John Rogers: They're heirs as well.

John Rogers: Does that make sense?

Fatima Razavi: So, would it be an exactory interest in life, measuring the life of Anna and Bob? Is that how you would write it?

John Rogers: Because, no, it would be in fee, because if Rick dies before A and B,

John Rogers: then Rick's heirs will take over the executor interest until… Ann and or Bob, Breaches.

John Rogers: So, it will survive for the duration of the last survivor of Ann or Bob.

John Rogers: the remaining survivor of either Ann or Bob.

John Rogers: Make sense?

dovenight: So when… so Ian and Penfob, they both are gone, they die, then it goes to Rick.

John Rogers: If they die, no.

John Rogers: It's if… You guys, we did this in lecture many times.

John Rogers: discussed this in lecture. In fact, I even wrote it in the notes and gave you guys a copy. So…

John Rogers: Ann and Bob.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: It says, specifically, if

John Rogers: So long as neither Ann nor Bob, okay? It doesn't say that Black Ager, for the rest of time, never has alcohol sold. It's very specific that says neither Ann nor Bob sells alcohol.

John Rogers: Ann nor Bob will live forever, okay? They will not live forever. If they are no longer living, it wouldn't make sense for them to have a restriction that says, so long as neither Ann nor Bob sells alcoholic beverages when they are dead.

John Rogers: So… Remember, they have it in joint tenancy, so whoever survives the longest… We'll succeed to this.

John Rogers: Once that last remaining survivor dies, Their heirs will succeed

John Rogers: In fee-simple absolute ownership with no restrictions whatsoever.

John Rogers: Because the grantor was very specific that only Ann and Bob are subject to this, not their heirs.

John Rogers: So… Rick.

John Rogers: who would divest Ann or Bob, that interest by Rick, Will last no longer than…

John Rogers: the lifespan of the last remaining survivor of Anurbaba.

John Rogers: Question.

Amir Akbari: So, the heir's interest, future interest, it would be indefeasibly wasted remainder.

John Rogers: No?

Amir Akbari: The…

John Rogers: Who's there?

Amir Akbari: after… after dying to Anna and Bob, if I… I just wanna… Sit down.

John Rogers: Well, Ann and Bob have it in fee simple fee, okay? So when they die, where's it go? It goes to their heirs.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, but they… they're gonna… they are, like, interest holder, it's gonna… after they die, they… no.

Amir Akbari: And that's not gonna… okay.

Amir Akbari: Got it. Thank you. Sorry.

John Rogers: So… Any other questions?

Fatima Razavi: I still don't understand why it's in fee. I'm really sorry. I'm stuck on it.

John Rogers: With what is in fee?

Fatima Razavi: Executive interest in feet, if it's…

Fatima Razavi: How I'm imagining this is Rick is just chilling.

Fatima Razavi: And then he's waiting until somebody dies to take over.

John Rogers: But it's limited to the space. No, no, no, no, no.

Fatima Razavi: No, no, no.

John Rogers: Oh, no. No, he's not waiting for someone to die to take over. That is not correct.

Fatima Razavi: Ann and Bob to die.

John Rogers: No, no, no, no. He's waiting for someone to breach.

John Rogers: And he can only take it from Ann or Bob. So let's be very clear about that.

Fatima Razavi: If… if Ann or Bob breach.

Fatima Razavi: Yes. Yes, but then why is it in feet? Wouldn't it be for the term of Ann and Bob's existence?

Fatima Razavi: Wouldn't want to be in life, measuring life of Ann and Bob? I just don't understand why it's phi.

John Rogers: It would be in fee because if Rick dies before Ann and Bob, his heirs would take that over. Until both Anne or Bob

John Rogers: die.

John Rogers: It's fee.

John Rogers: But I understand what you're talking about. Interesting.

Fatima Razavi: I wouldn't have caught that.

John Rogers: We did… this is an example in your book that we covered. So if you go through present interest, there were some problems in the back.

John Rogers: the last that we went over, and I believe it was question 7, if I'm not mistaken.

John Rogers: And this exact scenario is in your book that we went over.

John Rogers: So… This, I happen to take notice.

John Rogers: That the uniform statutory rule against perpetuities applies.

John Rogers: I want everyone to pay attention right now.

John Rogers: When it's modern principles, you apply U.S. Wrap.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: What you do is this. Let's keep it very simple, okay? Very simple.

John Rogers: Apply common law first.

John Rogers: In this scenario, if you apply the common law rule against perpetuities to Rick's interest.

John Rogers: Is it valid or void?

Jude Seleck: Valid.

Amir Akbari: deployed…

John Rogers: it's valid.

John Rogers: Because… Put everybody on a plane.

John Rogers: to Hawaii.

John Rogers: Carrie?

John Rogers: Everyone that you can see, put them on a plane.

John Rogers: That plane crashes.

John Rogers: is Rick's… Executory interest.

John Rogers: Going to survive further and further and further?

John Rogers: Is it still going to be in existence if everyone dies in a plane crash?

Gevorg Kulikyan: No.

John Rogers: Why?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Because if Ann and Bob are dead, he no longer has an interest.

John Rogers: Yes, he's got nothing to take! They're dead! They're dead! So it's not gonna be floating around in perpetuities forever!

doven: Would it… if it was for a… Sorry.

doven: If it was cold…

John Rogers: This is where I'm gonna start yelling at people, because we went over this.

John Rogers: in my notes that I have sent you in class.

John Rogers: These examples we went over. We went over all this.

John Rogers: We went over all of this.

John Rogers: Guaranteed. Guaranteed.

John Rogers: If… when you apply U.S. wrap.

John Rogers: and the interest.

John Rogers: Is void, for example.

John Rogers: Then you word… then you go into the wait and see.

John Rogers: And you can kind of apply wait 30 or wait 90 years, whatever you want to see, but it's wait and see, and see if the interest does, in fact, vest.

John Rogers: You don't need to go into wait and see. If the common law says it's valid under the common law, you can stop there. If the common law voids it, then you move into the wait and see.

John Rogers: I want you all To burn that in your brain, okay?

John Rogers: Burn that in your brain. Please burn that in your brain. I'm gonna repeat myself, okay?

John Rogers: Apply U.S. Wrap.

John Rogers: The first step is to apply the common law, okay? If the common law

John Rogers: Voids the interest. Then you move into the wait and see.

John Rogers: Wait and see is, let's just see if this interests vests one day.

John Rogers: And if it does, it's valid.

John Rogers: If it doesn't, It's void.

John Rogers: Okay… You with me so far?

doven: If the question… if the question said that as long as neither sells alcohol… as long as no alcohol beverages are sold, then that would be, like, forever.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: Oh, yes, yes, yes, that's correct. That would be forever. That would be forever, yes, but remember, it says neither and nor Bob.

John Rogers: It doesn't say neither… it doesn't say neither Ann, nor Bob, or anyone else after them.

John Rogers: So who sells alcohol? It's just Ann and Bob can't sell alcohol.

John Rogers: Remind me never to go to Blackacre.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor?

Gevorg Kulikyan: When… we can obviously tell that

Gevorg Kulikyan: It's valid. Should we even bring up the rule against perpetuities?

John Rogers: Yes. And say that it's valid. Yes, 100%.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: I need you. I need you to burn this in your head.

John Rogers: I don't know how more obvious I can make it, okay? I need you to put this in your head.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: First, apply the common law. If it's void, then you go to the wait and see.

John Rogers: If it's valid, you stop there. Move on. Wonderful. You want to write the wait and see? Go ahead, I don't care.

John Rogers: But you must discuss the common law first, because under U.S. wrap, it says, first apply the common law.

John Rogers: Then you go into wait and see, and see if the interest actually does best. So, like, let's see if Rick actually gets it one day.

John Rogers: So Rick's interest is valid.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Am I missing something here? I don't think so.

Gevorg Kulikyan: It's not wait and see 90 years.

John Rogers: Yeah, you can say that's fine.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Oh, God.

John Rogers: Oh, alright, in 1991!

John Rogers: In 1991. Ann… who's Anne?

John Rogers: Ann. That's my mom, Ann. Anne conveyed her interest in Blackacre.

John Rogers: by valid deed to Sarah.

John Rogers: valid deed. See how it says valid deed again? That prevents the cowboys and cowgirls from…

John Rogers: Question the validity of the deed.

John Rogers: So here we have to discuss, Ann did not tell Bob about the transfer to Sarah.

John Rogers: What does that tell you?

doven: She don't have to.

Mireya Gonzalez: Is there a joint tenancy severance?

John Rogers: There is no requirement that Ann inform Bob of anything.

John Rogers: So, the first issue is severance.

John Rogers: of the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Because Anne conveyed her interest to Sarah.

John Rogers: So now there's a severance.

John Rogers: So… Sarah… has… is what? Sarah?

Fatima Razavi: Tenants in common.

John Rogers: And… Bob… Tannins in common, with 50%.

John Rogers: Ownership each. There we go.

John Rogers: So, if Sarah dies, Sarah's interest goes to her heirs. If Bob dies, Bob's 50% interest goes to Bob's heirs, okay?

John Rogers: With me so far?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Yes.

John Rogers: Alright, alright.

John Rogers: In 1993, Good old days, huh?

John Rogers: Sarah died intestate. That means Sarah died without a will, okay?

John Rogers: Sarah's only living relative at the time of her death was Tom. Okay, so Tom succeeds… someone writing me something?

John Rogers: So, Tom… so, Tom… succeeds to S's interest.

John Rogers: So that means that Tom and Bob equal tenants in common.

John Rogers: with 50… Percent each.

John Rogers: That make sense?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: In this case, would you have two tenants and common discussions back-to-back?

John Rogers: Hmm, I mean, it's just… This should be very…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: pretty quick.

John Rogers: You don't have to discuss creating tenants in common.

John Rogers: So… Is this… is everybody okay so far? Is everyone okay?

Karen Hernandez: Yes.

Mireya Gonzalez: I'm not, because you said… You… there's no need in discussing it?

Mireya Gonzalez: What? I knew.

Mireya Gonzalez: Is that what I heard?

John Rogers: That was about 5 minutes ago. Where you been?

John Rogers: what I said was, oh, not discussing it? Oh, you said… oh, okay, okay. I think the question was, do we need to discuss tenants in common again?

John Rogers: I don't think that you need to talk about it again. I don't know what you would talk about again.

John Rogers: Because this one is severance then transposes the interest to tenants in common, and this is just a successor in interest

John Rogers: whatever Sarah had.

John Rogers: So Tom is just simply succeeding to what Sarah had.

John Rogers: And Sarah had a tense in common, 50% interest, with Bob.

John Rogers: Easy?

John Rogers: In 1993, oh, again.

John Rogers: Repetitive, 1993, it's a 1993 time, alright!

John Rogers: After Sarah's death, so, here… Bob and Rick.

John Rogers: Bob and Rick.

John Rogers: Okay, a co-tenancy holder And a future interest holder.

John Rogers: This is getting weird.

John Rogers: Bob and Rick learned that Anne had conveyed her interest in Blackacre to Sarah.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: When Tom approached Bob after Sarah's death to discuss his interest in Blackacre, Bob refused to speak with Tom.

John Rogers: Bob's then.

John Rogers: has his lawyer, should say had, or has his lawyer send a letter to Tom denying Tom's interest in Blackacre.

John Rogers: So what is that?

Fatima Razavi: Is it ousting?

John Rogers: Yes… is…

Fatima Razavi: Our ouster.

John Rogers: ouster.

John Rogers: Is that an ouster?

John Rogers: Is that an Alistair?

Amir Akbari: I think it's not a ouster, because they are not physically… Hello, okay.

John Rogers: Not physical.

John Rogers: There's counsel involved, and… someone's asserting

John Rogers: Legal ownership interest, and by the letter, it's exclusive ownership interest.

John Rogers: almost… by implication, Threats legal action in the event of not honoring.

John Rogers: that I'm the exclusive owner.

doven: Did we talk about, also, taxes and other stuff?

John Rogers: Yeah, sure, absolutely, because once there's an ouster, you have to talk about rents and stuff like that.

John Rogers: But this is important, because is this an ouster?

John Rogers: And it's not something very simple. This shouldn't be, oh, it's an ouster because you did this buy, I'm gonna have a wonderful break, I got an A-plus on property. You're gonna get whacked.

John Rogers: Because you have to really think about, is this an ouster or not, and why?

John Rogers: That's what I'm here to…

John Rogers: For final exam purposes, I would be sitting there going, okay, ouster, okay, thank God they saw it. Now.

John Rogers: Let me get my thinking cap on.

John Rogers: Let's see what they wrote about it. Here, this is an ouster because he got a letter, bye! Oh, man, you're, like, at a C-.

John Rogers: You're not thinking.

John Rogers: So, is this in a cluster? Now, it's a third person who did it, but it's certainly an agent of the client who is

John Rogers: Bob.

John Rogers: And was it… is it implicit that If you don't honor

John Rogers: Bob's demand that you potentially could be sued or face legal repercussions?

John Rogers: Can you receive a letter from a… From an attorney.

Sennett Devermont: Yeah, and also, it says in your notes, a claim of right to exclusive possession.

Sennett Devermont: So I think if you got a letter from the attorney, you would…

Sennett Devermont: I think that would suffice to… Not supposed to be.

John Rogers: Is Bob saying it, though?

Sennett Devermont: Well, Bob's counsel…

John Rogers: Yeah, so it's actually an agent through Bob, so it's actually as if it's Bob, right?

John Rogers: And went to the lengths of getting counsel and directing counsel to do it. So yes, this could potentially… looks like it could be an ouster!

doven: the committee.

John Rogers: Bob!

doven: Well, you argue the agent, and you argue kinds of stuff, so you say that because this is an agent.

doven: This is potentially your own store.

John Rogers: Well, yeah, I mean, and it… it… Bob is, in essence, claiming, denying ownership, and by implication, asserting exclusive ownership.

John Rogers: So then you would talk about rents and stuff like that, rents… oops.

John Rogers: Rent ECC.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: In 1994, so we don't know how long, Bob… okay.

John Rogers: Bob opened a restaurant on Black Acre. The rent restaurant sells wine and beer.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: If… This was void.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: If this was void, if the common law… U.S. wrap common law voids this.

John Rogers: Then it's going to be valid within 90 years, because we know here, that…

John Rogers: Four years later, there was a breach.

John Rogers: So Rick would get it.

John Rogers: Make sense?

doven: Well, we argued, but if it was void, then…

doven: You know, there wouldn't be no, Breach, right?

John Rogers: Well, no. If it's void under the common law, you then move into the wait and see.

John Rogers: See if the interest vests.

John Rogers: And we know here that it did, in fact, vest, because Bob breached.

John Rogers: So… Here you go.

Fatima Razavi: Would… would a topic of, like… sorry, this might be completely, like, partition or anything come up, because he's now profiting, and they are kind of not getting along?

John Rogers: I don't think so.

Fatima Razavi: Okay.

John Rogers: I don't think so.

John Rogers: Oh, is there a breach?

Leanna Badar: Professor, so if Bob didn't breach, then we wouldn't be going into the wait and see?

John Rogers: You'd have a very, very short discussion of wait and see, because you'd have to see within the next 90 years, did the interest vest?

John Rogers: Sometimes exams don't go out 90 years.

John Rogers: So you just look to see if

John Rogers: Rick's interest would vest, and it would.

John Rogers: Because there's been a breach now.

doven: We said, you'll give us a C-, and we just said, oh, he just pals, and that's it.

John Rogers: Yeah, sure.

John Rogers: Look, you have to remember something, okay?

John Rogers: This is a take-home final. This is a take-home final, okay?

John Rogers: Take home. Remember that. Take home. You are not under the gun.

John Rogers: So, I don't have a lot of sympathy for… like…

John Rogers: silly… I mean, look, you should really do a very good job. I've read some very good essays under timed conditions.

John Rogers: There's no way any of them should ever beat you.

John Rogers: So… looks like a breach, so I would probably say Rick equals the fee-simple absolute owner now.

John Rogers: Let's see what happens.

John Rogers: So now, potentially, 11 years later, okay?

John Rogers: Get your calculator out.

John Rogers: It is now 2015, the date of this final exam.

John Rogers: Bob continues to run, a successful restaurant on Black Acre.

John Rogers: Bob has paid all the insurance, expenses, and taxes on Blackacre from 1990 until present.

John Rogers: Rick and Tom… had never taken any action against Bob's possession of Blackacre.

John Rogers: So, who is Bob adversely possessing?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Rick.

Fatima Razavi: Rick.

John Rogers: Correct.

John Rogers: Bill.

John Rogers: Is Bob actually occupying the land?

doven: That's true.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Is it open and notorious?

doven: Yes.

John Rogers: Why would you say that this is open and notorious?

doven: You got that restaurant, please.

doven: Paying on insurance, I mean, people can see it.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: This is what, on a final exam, I would be thinking.

John Rogers: Yeah, everyone's gonna get it.

John Rogers: But I would be looking for the students

John Rogers: that spot this. It says successful now.

John Rogers: So the fact that something is successful, does that make it even more open and notorious? More noticeable, something's successful?

doven: Yes.

Fatima Razavi: Yes, more exposure.

John Rogers: So, I'm just thinking that way.

John Rogers: So, really to stand yourself out is to pick up on things like that.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: I know in the olden days.

John Rogers: That was really a way for me to pick up on things, and it really helped me grading-wise.

John Rogers: For take-home vinyl, just looking for students to get creative.

John Rogers: Is it exclusive?

John Rogers: It was Bob sharing this land with anyone?

doven: Boom.

John Rogers: like it.

John Rogers: I wanna stop right there and… I want you all… To be very careful.

John Rogers: On something, okay?

John Rogers: And it's very common in every class.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: You want to be very careful and

John Rogers: This is not verbatim, but just be VERY.

John Rogers: Careful.

John Rogers: Especially in my classes, because some of you are taking me for evidence.

John Rogers: Some of you right. Here, there are no facts, blah, blah.

John Rogers: So, it's this. So, it's this.

John Rogers: When I read that, I'm thinking, okay, One…

John Rogers: Or… it's not so, it's like, okay, period. Therefore… I first ask myself, What is the argument?

John Rogers: The argument is there are no facts.

John Rogers: So if there's no facts for something, it is what it is?

John Rogers: Do I have to infer what your argument is?

John Rogers: Be very careful doing that.

John Rogers: The reason is, is you never want the greater, ever, to have to think and infer what an argument is, because that requires effort.

John Rogers: Nobody wants to put in a lot of effort, including bar graders. I'm sorry, but that's the truth.

John Rogers: So just be very careful when you say there are no facts. So many students would say there are no facts to say that it was

John Rogers: shared.

John Rogers: Period.

John Rogers: So that makes it exclusive?

John Rogers: You understand how that argument is flawed?

John Rogers: There are no facts to say it was shared.

John Rogers: So, it was… Exclusive.

John Rogers: I don't like that. So just be very careful.

doven: Can you say the facts are silent, the weather is exclusive, so you… so it can be inferred that he is running the business

doven: By himself.

John Rogers: Just, I use the word because.

John Rogers: solves everything.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Just be very, very careful.

John Rogers: If you ever, especially in my class, When you say, no facts, When you say that, I guarantee you.

John Rogers: I could find something. I could find SOME fact.

John Rogers: Okay? So be VERY careful.

John Rogers: I can't guarantee it, maybe sometimes there's not, but just be careful.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Is it… Continuous?

John Rogers: Is Bob's occupancy continuous?

Mireya Gonzalez: I would say so, to have a successful restaurant.

John Rogers: Yes, right? So it's kind of a prolonged effort over time, when something was initially began, to being successful.

John Rogers: There's that period where… You assume that there's a lot of effort involved.

John Rogers: Constant upkeeping. Consistency involved.

John Rogers: For the term, successful, right?

John Rogers: And… Term of years.

John Rogers: did… Bob fulfill the term of yours?

doven: That's 21 years.

Gevorg Kulikyan: We don't know what the statute of limitations is, right, Professor?

John Rogers: That's right.

John Rogers: You can't see. Darn it, I don't know! Oh no! The sky is falling, we don't know!

John Rogers: The sky is falling!

John Rogers: Help!

John Rogers: Anybody, please help! Look, you don't know. We don't know! No clue! Yay! So you can't fully conclude

John Rogers: that Bob would succeed. You can't!

John Rogers: Hey, maybe you want to say common law requires 20 years, go for whatever you want.

doven: Monty law requires 30 years, or to continue.

John Rogers: Modern law requires 30 years, where you getting that from? Yeah, you didn't do that for me.

John Rogers: I never said 30 years. Common law requires 20 years. Modern law is the statute of limitations, period.

John Rogers: is governed by statute. Okay. So what statute, what in this jurisdiction is it? We don't know, because it has to say.

John Rogers: And it doesn't say.

John Rogers: So before you start freaking out, and say the sky is falling, It's not.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: You just can't conclude that they would, succeed at adverse possession.

John Rogers: Now, that's all I really see in this hypo.

John Rogers: Was this that bad?

doven: What about Rick and Tom? They never took any action.

John Rogers: Yeah, I never did. Rick and Tana have never taken any action. That means… That means,

John Rogers: Here's the thing.

John Rogers: Adverse possession began once the death occurred. See, it says in 1994… oh, wait a second.

John Rogers: Oh my god, I don't know how to do math. This is 21 years, I said 11.

John Rogers: I said 11 years! I said 11 years!

Fatima Razavi: Davis at 21.

John Rogers: I said 11! No one corrected me. What is wrong with you all?

Fatima Razavi: Professor Dove said 21. He did correct you.

John Rogers: For once in my life, I was wrong.

John Rogers: I apologize.

John Rogers: Doesn't happen, so go buy a lottery ticket, because that never happens. I'm never wrong. I am…

John Rogers: I mean, I do look in the mirror every morning and try to find flaws, and it's really hard, so…

John Rogers: Stop.

John Rogers: I said 11 years, what is wrong with me?

John Rogers: you could default to common law if you want. You could say common law.

John Rogers: is 20 years. And if you want to go with that, go with it. It doesn't matter. Fine. Okay?

John Rogers: Fine, you want to find adverse possession.

John Rogers: No problem, find it.

John Rogers: I just don't think that that's ever really worth a lot, but… Yeah, someone has a question.

Mireya Gonzalez: Would we speak about the sharing of benefits because of the successful restaurant? Like, to give to the other…

Mireya Gonzalez: Tenants?

John Rogers: The problem is this.

John Rogers: the ONLY time…

John Rogers: Bob would have to share anything was after the ouster, but the moment Bob sold some… sold alcohol, Bob no longer owns it.

John Rogers: So Bob's just simply an adverse possessor at this point.

Mireya Gonzalez: Thank you.

John Rogers: Yes.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, two questions.

Gevorg Kulikyan: For the… the fact that he… Bob paid all of the insurance expenses and taxes, that's…

Gevorg Kulikyan: We can use those facts for the exclusive part of adverse possession.

John Rogers: and property tax for the minority view?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay. And then… Let's say we didn't find that that letter was an ouster.

Gevorg Kulikyan: If that letter wasn't an ouster, then the adverse possession would not work as well, correct?

John Rogers: Yeah.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: It has to be an Allison, but just be very careful, okay? When you see things like this, you don't want to write yourself out of a question, okay?

John Rogers: You try to look at it as objective as possible, okay?

Gevorg Kulikyan: But we could… we would still discuss it, just fail the adverse possession based off…

Gevorg Kulikyan: They're not being announced there.

John Rogers: I would just feel uncomfortable just failing something and then leaving other facts undiscussed.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Got it.

John Rogers: I'm gonna… Delete all this, okay?

John Rogers: Is that okay?

doven: Can you give a copy to us?

John Rogers: I will give a copy to you, but there's something I want to do real quick.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, so because it's Common Law's 20 years, we shouldn't talk about it, right?

Fatima Razavi: Because, I mean, because we're in modern law.

John Rogers: Generally, I… generally, you can default to common law when the statute is silent.

Fatima Razavi: I'm sorry, what did you say?

John Rogers: you can default to the common law when there is no statute. I believe that's in my notes.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: I'm gonna… Do something else really quick with this question.

John Rogers: What was that, question 17?

John Rogers: I am praying.

John Rogers: That I'm not getting sick right now.

John Rogers: God, I hope I'm not getting sick.

John Rogers: Please don't. It's my friend's wedding this weekend.

John Rogers: What happens if it said 2N and BOV?

John Rogers: for life.

John Rogers: I want to go over this real quick.

John Rogers: So I guess I would say, oh…

John Rogers: Presumably has an FSA, who the FO does. A and B.

John Rogers: Have a joint tenancy, right?

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: So… Here's the thing you need to remember.

John Rogers: It's a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: But the joint tenancy will only last for the duration.

John Rogers: Of the longest remaining survivor.

John Rogers: So… if… and dies.

John Rogers: Bob has a full-fledged life estate.

John Rogers: Well, subject to executory limitation, but…

John Rogers: It will last for the duration of Bob's life.

John Rogers: You with me so far?

John Rogers: Care.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: everything else remains the same. So, like, A and B would have a joint tenancy, they would also have a life estate subject to executory limitation, okay?

John Rogers: And then Rick would have executive interest, In feet, okay?

John Rogers: And what's supposing… A dies. Oh, no, that's… oh, no,

John Rogers: Yeah, A dies. Okay, that's so sad! Oh, no! What does B have?

Amir Akbari: And then Team Conrad.

John Rogers: With who?

Amir Akbari: No, the 100% of the…

John Rogers: In life, right?

Amir Akbari: In life, and… In life.

John Rogers: Life.

Amir Akbari: Yes, like…

John Rogers: So, B would have, a life estate Subject to executor limitation, right?

John Rogers: You with me so far? Does everyone see that? I want everyone to look at this. Does this make sense?

Karen Hernandez: Yes.

Fatima Razavi: Well, sorry, I don't. Would it… wouldn't it be a present possessory interest?

John Rogers: President of Liposate.

Fatima Razavi: Because then it's like, now it's shifted to… okay, sorry, thank you.

John Rogers: shifting at all, it's just what Bob has right now.

John Rogers: So everybody get that so far?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Let's assume Bob sells this.

John Rogers: What does C have?

John Rogers: Exactly.

Amir Akbari: She has a present possessory interest for the life of the bee.

Jude Seleck: Life estate.

Jude Seleck: Bob cannot sell more than his… his interest.

John Rogers: Right, so what does C have, exactly?

Jude Seleck: Life has let's… life has stayed, subject to executive limitation.

John Rogers: For whose life?

Amir Akbari: Peace Life.

John Rogers: So, you're right.

John Rogers: It's a life estate. So, Cara has a present possessory interest.

John Rogers: in a life estate per attruvie, right? Oops.

John Rogers: In, subject to… Executory limitation.

John Rogers: You got that?

John Rogers: Because it can't be longer than A's interest, more than B's interest.

John Rogers: So C has it subject to the length of time B is alive.

John Rogers: Which is paratra V, right?

John Rogers: You get that so far?

John Rogers: You got that so far?

Fatima Razavi: Can you write it in a different way, or is this the only way to write it? Could you write P, a present possessor interest in a life estate, subject to exactuary limitation, measuring…

Fatima Razavi: life of B, or do you have to write peratra V?

John Rogers: Atruvi. Atruvi? I forget.

Fatima Razavi: If you wrote it the other way, would it… would you get marked off?

John Rogers: Marked off doing what? How would you write it?

Fatima Razavi: instead of writing preacher V, at the end of it saying, With the measuring life… a V?

John Rogers: Sure.

Fatima Razavi: Okay. Thank you.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Can you share that one, Professor?

John Rogers: Class is done.

doven: Oh, yeah, Geek used in that one, too.

John Rogers: I'm not sending that one.

Agnes Gholoonian: It's recorded? Okay, we're good, guys.

John Rogers: You guys are free to do whatever you want, huh?

Jude Seleck: Yeah. May I ask a question? I mean, hypothetically, there are 3 joint tenants.

Jude Seleck: ABC. She conveys his… interest to B.

John Rogers: Okay.

Jude Seleck: Now, A and B is still joint tenants, right?

John Rogers: with a yes.

Jude Seleck: And B, joint tenancy no longer has any interest, but his interest is no longer part of joint tenancy.

Jude Seleck: B's original interest is still, I mean, joint tenancy, but sees interest conveyed becomes… Tenancy in common.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: But… Oh, man!

John Rogers: Let me think about that.

Jude Seleck: Because if C transfers to D, a third person, D becomes tenancy in common, and BCO…

John Rogers: I understand that, but everything was given to B.

John Rogers: So B has 66% interest with A.

Jude Seleck: Perfect.

John Rogers: Who has 33% interest.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: I would say that if… if B dies, then… the maximum

John Rogers: If B dies, A would then get 66%.

John Rogers: But B would get 33% for B's heirs, because it was in tenants in common.

John Rogers: Yeah, that's my… That's my answer.

Jude Seleck: Thank.

doven: Professor, I'm gonna send you an essay, is that okay?

John Rogers: Yeah, that's fine. You know, class was done a few minutes ago. This is the biggest amount of group I've ever seen stick around, so what's… what's happening? What's going on? Usually people are gone.

Fatima Razavi: We're hoping somebody asks a question and we happen to miss it, or just something just happens that we catch it.

John Rogers: Okay.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Oh, Professor.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I don't know if you remember, on one of the Saturday reviews, we had,

Gevorg Kulikyan: I think it was the Alice in the Wonderland essay, or…

John Rogers: Yeah.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Do you remember in that one, there was also a U.S. rap situation that we discussed?

John Rogers: I think, I don't remember.

Gevorg Kulikyan: You said that for U.S. RAP, we would first apply the common law?

John Rogers: Okay.

Gevorg Kulikyan: And then wait and see.

Gevorg Kulikyan: for U.S. rep. But you said if it's unknown, then we would wait and see.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So… But we're just checking to see if it's valid or void.

John Rogers: So, yeah, okay. So, when you apply the comm law under U.S. wrap, okay.

John Rogers: You first apply the common law.

John Rogers: If it's void, it's no good, it's canceled.

John Rogers: Then you move on to wait and see.

John Rogers: If the common law says it's valid, then we don't need to go through the wait and see, because it's valid.

John Rogers: Okay.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Oh my god.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I don't know if you remember, that changes a lot for that one essay.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I remember it being an issue.

John Rogers: I stand by my answer to that one.

John Rogers: I stand by it, because I'm never wrong.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Except for the 11 and 21, huh?

John Rogers: That's correct. That's once in a lifetime. God, that was once in a lifetime! Can't believe it.

Mireya Gonzalez: Professor, I have a question in regards to the essay we just did, as far as, like, structurally.

Mireya Gonzalez: For the first question, that's when we would discuss just, like, the details of the first paragraph only.

Mireya Gonzalez: Is that right? And then the second question…

Mireya Gonzalez: Then we would go into everything else, all… everything else after that.

John Rogers: Sure.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor, you're holding Saturday classes today, right? This week, right?

John Rogers: Yeah, I'm doing evidence and property. Do you guys want to do, want me to start property first, or evidence first? What do you guys want to do?

Agnes Gholoonian: It doesn't matter, as long as you do both.

John Rogers: I think… I stand by that property final. I… I think is harder than evidence.

John Rogers: I'll double check. I'll know by Saturday. I'll… I'll… All no.

John Rogers: But there is an evidence essay that someone

John Rogers: called me about today, that I said, oh, that's a good one, we'll go. It's a civil case.

John Rogers: We can go over that on Saturday.

John Rogers: Go over that.

John Rogers: And then for property, Do whatever you guys want to do.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Did you send out an email already for this Saturday, or you didn't say anything?

John Rogers: I've been so busy, I haven't done a lot of things.

John Rogers: There's a lot of things I have not done.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, for the essay that we just did.

Gevorg Kulikyan: How would it need to be written for the rules against perpetuity to get rid of the selling alcohol condition?

John Rogers: You mean getting rid of it? Oh, 2? .

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, like, you know how in certain…

John Rogers: so long as… Alcohol is never sold on Black Hager.

Gevorg Kulikyan: than to Rick.

John Rogers: Denturec, yeah.

John Rogers: But when you apply U.S. wrap.

John Rogers: The common law will void Rick's interest.

John Rogers: Under that scenario.

John Rogers: but it would then survive the wait and see, because Bob ultimately breached.

Gevorg Kulikyan: But, let's say he didn't breach.

Gevorg Kulikyan: And we wait and saw. So that condition would get… Deleted as well.

John Rogers: Yeah, if it doesn't fulfill wait and see, then hey, it's gone too.

John Rogers: Just wait and see if the interest vests or doesn't. If we don't know, it's gone.

Gevorg Kulikyan: because I know there's, like, scenarios where… The interest is still… Voided.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Based off of rules against perpetuity, but… the… Restriction still stays.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I can't.

John Rogers: Send me an email on it, or give me an example.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I have to look, I'll…

John Rogers: Send you an email.

John Rogers: Who's scared? You guys scared?

Agnes Gholoonian: Considering everything you told us, yes, we're very, very scared.

John Rogers: Are you worried about evidence or property?

Agnes Gholoonian: Both.

Agnes Gholoonian: But personally, yeah, both are very tough subjects.

Agnes Gholoonian: But I don't know about everybody else.

John Rogers: I don't know, I'll double check.

John Rogers: I'll triple check the final exams.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor, since it's, like, after hours, how screwed are we? Like, genuinely speaking, like, how tough is this final? For all?

Agnes Gholoonian: Are you just trying to scare us? Can you just be honest? Like, are you just trying to scare us, making us study? Because we will study. That's not a…

Agnes Gholoonian: That's not debated.

Agnes Gholoonian: How… how screwed are we?

John Rogers: 1 to 10.

John Rogers: What's going to be hard is this.

John Rogers: I can't reveal too much, but it's very, like, technical, like… not necessarily…

John Rogers: that, like, for example, if it's a conveyance, like O to A, That won't be hard.

John Rogers: But it's kind of like, what happens afterwards, and… you know.

John Rogers: how much interest does someone have, and how long will they have it for, and stuff like that. It's kind of just…

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay, so we.

John Rogers: I think it's a lot for you guys. It's not impossible. I'm just a, you know, sketchball, because I don't think that my questions are really that hard in comparison to…

John Rogers: the questions you'll get. I'd like to write questions that are consistent with the bar. It's maybe a little bit more vague.

John Rogers: This is not.

John Rogers: What?

John Rogers: it's just, I'm a little bit worried because I didn't write any of the questions.

John Rogers: So, you won't be familiar with my…

John Rogers: with the style of it, but they're similar to Michelle Tobankin's, and we went over two of Michelle Tobankin questions. It was like a…

John Rogers: one was, like, a prize-winning rose garden or something like that, Mad Acre? Is that right? Yes, the Mad Acre Garden. Similar to that, so you could say, like, your final exam would be similar to something like that.

John Rogers: As well as, kind of like question 4, Aura Owns Charmaker, something like that. It's more…

John Rogers: Looks more like it's a bankan-type question.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay, so we need to focus on the small little details, and we also need to focus on the dates.

John Rogers: I don't know about dates.

John Rogers: I don't hear about dates.

John Rogers: I don't think… I don't think dates are…

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay.

Yessenia Soria: Professor, I have a question. So, on the final, do you want us to write like the…

Yessenia Soria: the way we just did the essay, the O to the A and errors, or should we just write the

Yessenia Soria: Face, simple, absolute, write the whole word and the rule.

Yessenia Soria: And what we're… what we're gonna analyze on the essay, or are we gonna do it, like.

Yessenia Soria: the O to the FSA to the B, and all that?

John Rogers: I don't know what you're asking.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, I'll figure it out.

Jude Seleck: Professor, I have one last question. If, in a,

Jude Seleck: case. Both Shelly's case and RAP applies. Does it matter which one we apply first?

John Rogers: I always say do Shelly's case first, because you merge the two interests, and then you can only have one wrap discussion.

Jude Seleck: Okay.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, Wait, I'm sorry. I just sent two examples of what I was talking about, I think…

Gevorg Kulikyan: what I wrote.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Is what I'm saying.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So the first one, O to A, but if Black Acre is not used for residential purposes, then to B.

Gevorg Kulikyan: In that scenario, rules against perpetuity would void the… requirement, right?

John Rogers: The first example?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, 0 to A, but if black ak.

John Rogers: A…

Gevorg Kulikyan: not used.

John Rogers: A would succeed.

John Rogers: To 100% ownership interest, period.

Gevorg Kulikyan: And… but U.S. or, rules against perpetuity would get rid of that, but if Blackacre is not used for residential purposes.

John Rogers: Under the common law, yeah.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Under the common law.

John Rogers: if you apply U.S. Wrap and you apply wait and see, I don't know, because you'd have to wait 90 years to see

John Rogers: These interests ever became vested.

Gevorg Kulikyan: But in the second scenario, even if…

Gevorg Kulikyan: The rules against perpetuity voids it.

Gevorg Kulikyan: the… so long as Black Acre is used for residential purposes stays.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: and A would have a V simple determinable, and O would have a possibility reverter.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

Gevorg Kulikyan: But in the first scenario, OTA, fee simple absolute.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Wait and see.

Gevorg Kulikyan: And then if there's facts to show that 90 years went by.

John Rogers: The waitancy could apply to the second example, too.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Oh, yeah.

John Rogers: common law, though, under the common law, B's interest is gone.

John Rogers: Instances gone.

John Rogers: Automatically.

John Rogers: But if you apply wait and see, we have to wait 90 years to see if B's interest would ever.

Gevorg Kulikyan: He would ever get it.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So the only difference in these two is that restraint of using Blackacre for residential purposes.

John Rogers: Yes.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: Now, I gave you guys that example, right?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

John Rogers: I did.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I tried to remember it.

John Rogers: It's in my notes, I wrote it… I wrote it… I wrote that for you guys.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yes, yes, yes.

Yessenia Soria: Good night, all!

John Rogers: So, I am worried about some of you guys, some class members, so…

John Rogers: Keep that in mind, but I never reach out to students, say, hey, I'm worried about you.

John Rogers: So, you're gonna have to hit me up, okay?

John Rogers: I was like, I think, getting a random text from me saying.

John Rogers: Hi, I'm really worried about you, is kind of weird.

Mireya Gonzalez: Professor, is it fair to say that the three essays, one's gonna be on present, possessorian estates, landlord, tenant, and co-ownership?

John Rogers: I can't tell you anything.

John Rogers: Okay, let's, talk about Shelly's case, okay?

John Rogers: Does anyone have any questions about Shelly's case? Now, I'm not representing Shelly's case as tested or not, but I just have a feeling I have been getting some questions about Shelly's case, so I thought I'd go over it.

John Rogers: So, does anyone have any specific questions about Shelly's case, or you just kind of want to give the example, like, a basic example?

Agnes Gholoonian: Can you please do a basic example?

John Rogers: Here we go.

Agnes Gholoonian: By the way, Professor, if you… it's 9… 9.34, we can wait until Saturday, if you'd like.

Agnes Gholoonian: If everybody's okay, we can wait until Saturday. I don't want to keep anybody.

John Rogers: kid me? I think last week, I was on… I was almost here till 10!

Sennett Devermont: Yeah, we're good if you're good, Professor.

Agnes Gholoonian: we can… I… I…

Sennett Devermont: No, no, I mean now, if you're okay, we could continue.

John Rogers: Okie dokie.

John Rogers: Let me open up a fresh page.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So,

John Rogers: Let's do a basic example, O.

John Rogers: 2A for life.

John Rogers: Ugh!

John Rogers: Then, 2… A's errors.

John Rogers: Basic example.

John Rogers: Okay? So, you have an instrument, okay, O conveys Black Acre, Oops.

John Rogers: Nope.

John Rogers: by valid deed, 2… So, in this instance, we have… one instrument.

John Rogers: Which is the valid deed, right?

John Rogers: It purports to convey A life estate, and a grantee, Which is A, right?

John Rogers: to A for life.

John Rogers: same instrument, conveys… A future… a future fee interest.

John Rogers: in A's Heirs.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: I believe that's basically the rule, right?

John Rogers: But one instrument.

John Rogers: I have a feeling that some of you feel so sorry, but don't feel sorry. It's okay, I know you guys got this.

John Rogers: So… It's by one instrument, And… It conveys, it's valid.

John Rogers: purports to convey a life estate in A.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: and a future interest and fee to A's heirs, then to A's heirs.

John Rogers: Ace Heirs have a contingent remainder, because A is alive.

John Rogers: Apply Doctrine of Merger,

John Rogers: So, you couple these two interests.

John Rogers: You couple the interests with the doctrine of merger.

John Rogers: Because it would simply be redundant.

John Rogers: It operates the same as a fee simple absolute.

John Rogers: Because of that, the conveyance will just be O.

John Rogers: Does that make sense?

John Rogers: I've gotten cute, and I've gone, like, O to the A, so long as…

John Rogers: Otherwise, to be for life, then to be heirs.

John Rogers: I've done that.

John Rogers: So this just operates, this right here.

John Rogers: Operates the same, same analysis as right here.

John Rogers: So it just becomes a fee, simple absolute, and this would be a fee simple absolute in an executor interest.

John Rogers: Does that… Makes some sense.

Leanna Badar: Yeah, and then we merge it because it's the same person, right?

Leanna Badar: That's why it becomes a… be simple.

John Rogers: Because it operates the same as why divide them?

John Rogers: Into two separate interests, when it would simply operate the same.

John Rogers: And Leanna, you just have a beautiful voice. God, I wish I could hear it. I wish I heard it more this semester. Man.

Leanna Badar: There's always next semester.

John Rogers: That was next semester, okay. Mentally noted, okay? Mentally noted that we will hear ALL from you next semester, okay?

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Agnes, does that help clarify things?

Agnes Gholoonian: Yes, thank you.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

Agnes Gholoonian: You'll get it on Saturday.

John Rogers: Haha!

John Rogers: Oh, man.

Amir Akbari: I have a question about the essay we did in mentor session, about the assignment and sublease.

Amir Akbari: There is a paragraph, let me put it on the chat, and…

Amir Akbari: We need to find out its assignment, or… So, please.

Amir Akbari: But there was so… like, there was 3 different factors we should decide, but then I came back and checked that it was something like Tennessee case with Rogers, you remember? There was…

John Rogers: Hmm…

Amir Akbari: Yeah, there was a case like that. It's… First I thought it's assignment.

Amir Akbari: I feel like it's a sublease, because it's less than everything.

Amir Akbari: But there is two other language which says,

Amir Akbari: Tito doesn't have intent… there's a, like, selling the busyness, which shows her intent is not to coming back.

Amir Akbari: And also, it says Carlos started making rent payments to Brandon, which is the sign of the assignment for me.

Amir Akbari: Brandon's.

John Rogers: Sorry, I just hate… Look, the landlord is Lisa or Leo, or Larry. Period.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, exactly.

John Rogers: Cheeto, Tina, Ted, Tom.

Amir Akbari: Nope.

John Rogers: Brandon, I don't like.

John Rogers: Okay… Brandon. Okay. So, Brandon, no, Tito.

John Rogers: Is the tenant, Brandon. Okay. So if I'm reading this correctly, the entire lease…

Amir Akbari: his 3-year.

John Rogers: It's 3 years. But the entire remainder of the lease was not transferred.

Amir Akbari: Yes, it's less than everything.

John Rogers: So this has all the symptoms of Ernst versus conduit.

Amir Akbari: Condo, yes.

John Rogers: The only difference is.

Amir Akbari: They're all lit.

John Rogers: I think the entire lease was, was.

Amir Akbari: No, the only difference is, Carlos is making the payment to the brand.

Amir Akbari: I mean, the assignee or subleasee is paying the rent payments directly to the landlord.

John Rogers: Yes?

John Rogers: Which was consistent in…

Amir Akbari: assignment. Yes. But… but the language that it says January 1st to the August 13th of 23 is less than everything, right?

John Rogers: Is less than everything.

Amir Akbari: So, how we should decide in this situation? And what are the privity of contract? Is it privy of the state?

Amir Akbari: 19.

John Rogers: Yeah, first off, you're jumping ahead. You need to first decide an assignment or a sublease. From what you just sent me, I would say this is a sublease. It's less than everything, and it's less than

John Rogers: In the Ernst case, the entire lease

John Rogers: was turned over. The entire duration. This is not the entire duration.

John Rogers: And I think that that's a main consideration here.

John Rogers: And since it's less than everything, this would operate as a sublease.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, I just thought it's a… I just argued that this is the sublease, but then when I came back and…

Amir Akbari: remember that case, because the Carlos made a payment, right, right? Even there is no privy.

Amir Akbari: Here, and also, you… you said on that case, if someone is selling their business, it's… it's showing the intent… that person doesn't have intent to return.

Amir Akbari: And it's assignment, but…

Amir Akbari: Yeah, which… your main point is going through that, lesson every two minutes. Here, here's the thing out.

John Rogers: It doesn't make sense for someone to sell the business.

Amir Akbari: I don't read so.

John Rogers: time.

John Rogers: Not sell the entire lease duration.

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: Am I supposed to say something? I don't know.

John Rogers: I think someone sent me this question. I'll take a look at it.

Leanna Badar: Yeah, I did earlier.

John Rogers: Can you email it to me? Email it or text it to me, that way it's there, so I don't, I'll forget to look at it on here.

Amir Akbari: I agree.

John Rogers: You remember, you always have to keep on me, so you always have to text me, or call me, or email me, just keep going, keep poking at me, you know? I'll finally get in.

Amir Akbari: But even in this… this kind of situation on the exam, if we argue that, like, argued the… keep it aside and argued that, we would be fine, right?

John Rogers: Look.

Amir Akbari: Based on the rule.

John Rogers: For this, it's arguable.

John Rogers: I can't hold it against you.

John Rogers: if you… to say the other side. I mean, I may have my… strong position.

John Rogers: But I can't necessarily hold it against you.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, I could say 70% is a sublease, but…

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: But if you were to say that this is an assignment, I'd really want to know why.

Sennett Devermont: I thought it was an assignment because he's paying the landlord, directly.

John Rogers: And the first chapter, yeah, but the is that…

John Rogers: How do you assign less than everything?

Sennett Devermont: Right.

Amir Akbari: These are my points for that.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: I agree.

John Rogers: It's just… but here's the thing, he has no intent to return.

John Rogers: If he has no intent to return, but then why didn't you sell…

Amir Akbari: Yeah. Why didn't the sale of the business include the entire lease terms and duration?

Amir Akbari: Yeah, that makes sense.

Amir Akbari: So… Yup.

John Rogers: It kind of tells me that there's some type of reversion.

John Rogers: That… who has? Tito has?

John Rogers: So if you look at the Ernst case, This is distinguishable from that.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, would it be valid to say that, like, in this scenario, Carlos making the payments to Brandon.

Gevorg Kulikyan: They can think that they're in an assignment, but it doesn't matter what they think.

John Rogers: Minorities only, if they say it is what it is, that's what it is.

John Rogers: Majority is the intent and surrounding circumstances.

Amir Akbari: And in this case, if Brandon sued Carlos, since there is no assignment and there is no privy, that's not gonna be anything, right?

John Rogers: Yeah, probably not, there's no connection.

Amir Akbari: There is no privy of contractor. It's just privy of estate between the Tito and the Carlos, right?

John Rogers: Yes.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: Deanna, you worried about evidence or property?

Leanna Badar: Both.

John Rogers: Alright.

Leanna Badar: But I think you've, like, made property… More of a priority.

John Rogers: More of a priority?

Leanna Badar: Yeah, I think I'm a little bit more worried about property now.

John Rogers: I… you'd be fine the next couple of weeks.

John Rogers: I'll probably turn and say evidence is harder, but, you're in Sebastian, right?

Leanna Badar: Yeah, I was gonna say, if I had you for evidence, I probably wouldn't be as worried, but…

Leanna Badar: Because I have Sebastian, I'm a little…

John Rogers: My question's very straightforward, so my question will be the first one.

John Rogers: And it's pretty straightforward. It's not gonna be,

John Rogers: I don't think it's gonna be that hard.

John Rogers: His questions are very short, though. They're super short.

John Rogers: It's hard, I think it's hard, but they're very short.

John Rogers: property, I'll… I'll look.

John Rogers: At the, final exams.

John Rogers: Saturday morning.

John Rogers: Tomorrow.

John Rogers: And, let me know, and I'll let you know if my position… Changes after reviewing it.

John Rogers: One of the questions isn't that bad, though.

John Rogers: I do think two are tough.

John Rogers: Bye.

John Rogers: The two tough ones are kind of similar to each other.

Amir Akbari: Is it at the same level of what we did tonight, or, like, more difficult?

John Rogers: I mean, as far as question 17?

Amir Akbari: Yes.

John Rogers: It's harder than question 17.

Amir Akbari: Perfect.

John Rogers: And you guys are just trying to get stuff out of me, huh? Just trying to get stuff out of me. I got a lot of friends right now. Got so many friends.

John Rogers: So many friends. Oh, man. See, I told you about week 14, 13, 14, 15? I got lots of friends.

John Rogers: Man.

John Rogers: Everybody just wants to talk to me.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You could stop pressing record.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: And we can get to those.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Fun facts.

John Rogers: Anything else, guys?

Mireya Gonzalez: Have a good night, Professor.

John Rogers: I saw you over the weekend, or I saw your judge twin over the weekend.

John Rogers: And I saw former students over the weekend, too.

John Rogers: So yeah, I saw the… the judge… That you look like.

Mireya Gonzalez: What was your name again? Judge… Judge…

John Rogers: Yvette, they're a Stiggy.

Mireya Gonzalez: There's Stiggy, that's what it was.

John Rogers: She's a good judge. She's the supervising judge of all of criminal.

John Rogers: So, from… Pomona to Van Nuys from Lancaster to Long Beach. She's the top criminal judge.

Mireya Gonzalez: We will.

Mireya Gonzalez: Nice.

John Rogers: Dude, or am I paroled, guys? Am I allowed to go?

Agnes Gholoonian: Thank you, Professor.

Amir Akbari: And kiss so much. Have a good day.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Thanks, Professor.

John Rogers: Alright, I'm out, I know, I'm paroled for the night.

Leanna Badar: Thank you.
