## Adverse Possession and Future Interests

### Adverse Possession Against Life Estates

**Rule**: An adverse possessor **cannot** adversely possess against a future interest holder.

**Hypothetical**: O to A for life, then to B
- O: Fee simple absolute (FSA)
- A: Present possessory interest in a life estate (A is the measuring life)
- B: Indefeasible vested remainder

**If C adversely possesses during A's lifetime**:
- C gains adverse possession **only for the duration of A's life**
- C would have a life estate pur autre vie (for A's life)
- When A dies, adverse possession **starts over** against B
- B is a future interest holder and cannot be adversely possessed against

**Rationale**: C can only possess against the present possessory interest holder. Since B is a future interest holder, the adverse possession clock restarts when B's interest becomes possessory.

### Tacking in Adverse Possession

**When tacking does NOT apply**:
- No tacking discussion needed when the statute of limitations restarts due to a future interest vesting
- Different owners with intervening acts (like death terminating a life estate) are not successive adverse possessors
- Tacking is specific to adverse possessors (trespassers), not new owners

**When the clock does NOT restart**:
- If A has FSA and sells to B while T (trespasser) is adversely possessing
- B is not a future interest holder, just a new owner by sale
- The adverse possession clock continues running

### Life Estate Pur Autre Vie

**Creating a Life Estate Pur Autre Vie**:

**Example**: O to A for life, then to B. A sells "in fee simple absolute" to C.
- C takes only what A has
- A cannot convey more than A possesses
- C receives: Present possessory interest in a life estate with A being the measuring life
- This is a life estate **pur autre vie** (for the life of another)
- When A dies, the property goes to B (not C or C's heirs)

**Example**: O to A and B for life as joint tenants with right of survivorship
- Maximum duration is the life of one of them
- If B dies, A succeeds to 100% ownership in a life estate
- A has a present possessory interest in a life estate with A being the measuring life
- O retains a reversion

**If B sells her interest to C**:
- C receives a life estate pur autre vie (for B's life)
- When B dies, C's interest terminates

## Future Interests

### Analyzing Future Interests

**Step-by-step approach**:
1. Identify if it's a remainder
2. Determine if it's vested or contingent
3. If contingent: identify the condition precedent or unascertainable person
4. If vested: determine which type
   - Indefeasible
   - Subject to open
   - Subject to complete divestment

### Remainders: Vested vs. Contingent

**Vested Remainder**:
- In an ascertainable (living) person
- No condition precedent

**Contingent Remainder**:
- Either: condition precedent exists
- Or: unascertainable person

**Example**: O to A for life, then to B if B gets an A+ in evidence
- O: FSA (presumed)
- A: Present possessory interest in a life estate (A is measuring life)
- B: Contingent remainder (condition precedent: getting an A+)
- O: Reversion (if B doesn't satisfy the condition)

### Alternative Contingent Remainders

**Definition**: When two contingent remainders are created where one serves as an alternative to the other.

**Example**: O to A for life, then to B if B gets an A+ in evidence, otherwise to C
- A: Present possessory interest in a life estate (A is measuring life)
- B: Contingent remainder
- C: Alternative contingent remainder
- **No reversion** to O (one or the other must take)

**Note**: This concept appears in the 9th edition but was removed from the 10th edition of the textbook.

**Rule Against Perpetuities**: Alternative contingent remainders are subject to RAP because they are contingent remainders.

## Rule Against Perpetuities

### USRAP (Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities)

**Two-step analysis**:

**Step 1**: Apply common law RAP
- If valid under common law, the interest is valid
- If void under common law, proceed to Step 2

**Step 2**: Wait and see for 90 years
- If the interest vests within 90 years, it is **valid**
- If the interest does not vest within 90 years, it is **void**

### Common Law RAP: Children Reaching Age 22+

**Rule**: Any contingent interest requiring children to reach age 22 or more is **always void** under common law RAP.

**Example**: O to A for life, then to B's children who reach 22
- Facts: B has two children, C (age 21) and D (age 20)
- Under common law RAP: **VOID** (age requirement is 22)
- Under USRAP: Wait 90 years to see if it vests
  - If A dies 20 years later when C and D are 31 and 30: **VALID** (vested within 90 years)

## The Rule in Shelley's Case

**Context**: Common law concept and modern minority rule

**The Rule**: When one instrument purports to convey:
1. A life estate to a grantee, AND
2. A fee simple interest to that same grantee's heirs

Then the doctrine of **merger** applies, transposing the conveyance into a fee simple to the grantee.

**Example**: O to A for life, then to A's heirs

**Under Shelley's Case**:
- Treated as equivalent to: O to A and her heirs (FSA to A)
- OR in modern law: O to A (FSA to A)

**Rationale**: A will die and the property will go to A's heirs anyway. The life estate and remainder merge into a present fee simple absolute in A.

**Exam Approach**:
- Create a subheader for "Shelley's Case" or "Merger"
- Apply the doctrine if the pattern appears
- Do not need extensive discussion of merger itself

## Essay Writing Strategy

### Organization and Format

**General Rules**:
- Use IRAC format: Issue, Rule, Analysis/Application, Conclusion
- Break down each element systematically
- Conclusion should be a very short sentence (separate from analysis)
- Don't put your conclusion in your discussion

**Breaking Down Estates**:
Use at least two sentences:
1. Is the estate a present interest or future interest?
2. What type of estate is it exactly?

**Example**:
> "This is a present possessory interest because it is conveyed 'to A.' This present possessory interest will last for the duration of A's life, as evidenced by 'for life.' Therefore, A has a present possessory interest in a life estate."

**Avoid**: "A has a life estate because 'to A for life.'" (Too conclusory)

### Adverse Possession Organization

**Option 1 - Separate headers** (preferred if no page limit):
- Use subheaders for each element:
  - Actual
  - Open and Notorious
  - Exclusive
  - Hostile
  - Continuous
- Give rule, analysis, and conclusion for each

**Option 2 - Single paragraph** (acceptable with page restrictions):
- One header: "Adverse Possession"
- Give the overall rule
- Discuss each element within one paragraph
  - "Open and notorious requires... Here, [facts]..."
  - "Hostile requires... Here, [facts]..."
- One conclusion at the end

**Important**: Even in a single paragraph, ensure each element gets adequate discussion. Don't shortchange important elements just because you've written a lot overall.

### Page Limits and Restrictions

**Exam specifications**:
- Total: 30 pages (approximately 10 pages per essay)
- Double-spaced (5 pages single-spaced equivalent)

**With page restrictions**:
- Organization will not be graded
- Can combine issues into larger paragraphs
- Focus on complete substantive analysis over formatting
- Ensure every required element is discussed thoroughly

### Adverse Possession Special Issues

**Future Interest Holders**:
- Only discuss if the fact pattern raises the issue
- If applicable: conclude that adverse possessor "succeeds to adverse possession against A's interest, and A's interest only"
- Would typically be mentioned in the conclusion rather than as a separate section

**Multiple Adverse Possessors**:
- Generally combine into one discussion (preferred)
- Only write separate discussions if:
  - Different adverse possessor on separate piece of land
  - Different time periods that don't involve tacking

## Evidence Law Topics

*[Note: The review session transitioned to Evidence law midway through. Evidence topics covered included hearsay exceptions, business records, Crawford confrontation clause, and authentication. These are not included in this Property-focused outline.]*
