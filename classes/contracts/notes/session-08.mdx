## I. Battle of the Forms (UCC § 2-207)

### A. Material Alterations and Surprise Hardship

#### **Marvin Lumber & Cedar Co. v. PPG Industries**
- **Facts**: Marvin manufactured wooden doors/windows; PPG sold wood preservatives. PPG sent 66 acknowledgements with limitation of liability clause on back in fine print
- **Issue**: Does limiting liability clause involve element of unreasonable surprise and fail to become part of contract?
- **Rule**: UCC § 2-207 - Clause limiting remedy in reasonable manner involves no element of unreasonable surprise will become part of contract
  - **Comment 4**: Agreement is materially altered if addition would result in **surprise or hardship** without express awareness
- **Analysis**: Court followed Comment 4, rejecting Seventh Circuit's view that hardship alone isn't basis for finding material alteration
- **Holding**: Economic hardship here = court won't impose additional language on opposing party without full awareness
- **Key Principle**: If **surprise OR hardship**, courts won't enforce unless party was fully aware

**Exam Tip**: Arbitration clauses = always material alteration

### B. Last Shot Doctrine (Common Law Mirror Image Rule)

#### **Diamond Fruit Growers (Krack v. Metal-Matic)**
- **Facts**: Krack manufactured cooling units using Metal-Matic steel tubing. Metal-Matic acknowledged each release order with disclaimer of consequential damages and limitation of liability. After 10 years, tube defect caused ammonia leak in Diamond's warehouse
- **Issue**: Can Metal-Matic rely on contractual disclaimers to avoid contribution?
- **Common Law Result**: Under mirror image rule, seller's acknowledgement = counteroffer; buyer accepted by accepting goods (Last Shot Principle)
  - Buyer had "last shot" to reject but didn't
- **UCC § 2-207 Analysis**:
  1. Acknowledgement = definite and seasonable (timely) expression of acceptance
  2. If no contract under subsection 1, go to subsection 3
- **Holding**: Court upheld jury verdict; Metal-Matic partially responsible despite limitation provisions

## II. Digital Contracts and Shrinkwrap Licenses

### A. Shrinkwrap Licenses (Inside-the-Box Terms)

#### **ProCD v. Zeidenberg** (7th Cir.)
- **Facts**: ProCD marketed SelectPhone database at different prices (lower for consumers, higher for commercial). License inside packaging restricted use to non-commercial purposes. Zeidenberg bought consumer version, created company to resell database commercially
- **Issue**: Can shrinkwrap license inside box be valid contract?
- **Rule**: UCC § 2-204(1) - Contract may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including **conduct by both parties**
  - UCC § 2-606(1)(b) - Buyer accepts goods when, after opportunity to inspect, fails to make effective rejection under § 2-602(1)
- **Analysis**:
  - ProCD extended opportunity to reject if terms unsatisfactory
  - Zeidenberg inspected package, tried software, learned of license, did not reject
  - ProCD conditioned acceptance on using software after reading license
- **Holding**: Shrinkwrap license enforceable; Zeidenberg breached by commercial use
- **Key Principle**: Acceptance through **conduct** + opportunity to **return** = binding contract

**How to avoid**: Return in timely manner; argue no reasonable notice if box damaged/language hidden

#### **Gateway (Hill v. Gateway 2000)**
- **Facts**: Computer ordered by telephone, paid by credit card. Box arrived with terms inside (30-day return period). Computer had problems after 30 days. Plaintiffs filed class action under RICO
- **Issue**: Are terms shipped inside packaging enforceable?
- **Rule**: Follows ProCD - buyer bound by terms accepted by keeping computer beyond return period
- **Holding**: Buyer must arbitrate dispute; terms enforceable
- **Arbitration Clause Discussion**:
  - Prevents jury trial and court access
  - Cost-effective but potentially biased
  - Limits class actions
  - Protects companies more than consumers

### B. Clickwrap vs. Browsewrap Agreements

#### **23andMe (In re 23andMe)**
- **Facts**: DNA testing service. Purchase stage didn't require viewing/accepting Terms of Service (only hyperlink). Account registration required review and assent to terms. Terms included arbitration clause
- **Issue**: Is arbitration clause enforceable under internet contract formation laws?
- **Distinctions**:
  - **Browsewrap**: User continues without knowing contract exists - insufficient notice during purchase
  - **Clickwrap**: During registration, customers reviewed terms and gave assent - sufficient notice
- **Holding**:
  - Terms NOT enforceable for customers who only purchased kit
  - Terms ENFORCEABLE for customers who created account + purchased kit
- **Key Principle**: **Reasonable notice** determines enforceability

#### **Meyer v. Uber Technologies**
- **Facts**: Plaintiff registered for Uber on Samsung phone, agreed to T&C including arbitration
- **Evidence**: Screenshots show registration process (page 190)
- **Holding**: Clickwrap agreement enforceable; plaintiff bound to arbitration
- **Key Elements**: Clear display, must click to proceed

#### **Cullers v. Uber Technologies** (Mass. 2021)
- **Facts**: Blind man denied rides three times due to guide dog; sued Uber
- **Issue**: Are app conditions enforceable if user not properly informed?
- **Rule**: Agreement not enforceable without **reasonable notice** of terms and conditions
- **Holding**: Against Uber - blind plaintiff not given reasonable notice
- **Key Principle**: Reasonable notice accounts for disabilities/circumstances

**Americans with Disabilities Act**: Companies must follow ADA accommodation requirements

#### **Hastings v. Unicoin**
- **Facts**: Online token sale; checkbox stating "I read statements, agree to privacy policy and terms of service" but no requirement to click hyperlink first
- **Issue**: Is arbitration clause enforceable?
- **Rule**: Reasonable internet user must understand they need to click hyperlink for terms
- **Holding**: Terms not enforceable - not clear to user
- **Key Principle**: Terms of service must be **conspicuous and clear**

### C. Constructive vs. Actual Notice

**Constructive Notice**: Notice law imputes to person even without actual knowledge because:
- Information publicly available, OR
- Could be reasonably discovered through ordinary care

**Examples**:
- Real estate deeds (recorded to give notice)
- Liens (filed to give notice to world)

**Application**: Courts examine whether user had actual OR constructive notice of terms

## III. Acceptance Principles and Hypos

### A. Counteroffers vs. Mere Inquiries

#### Problem 1: Counteroffer Effect
- **A**: Offers Blackacre for $5,000 (30 days)
- **B**: "I will pay $4,800"
- **A**: Refuses
- **B**: Accepts within 30 days
- **Result**: NO CONTRACT
- **Rule**: Counteroffer **kills original offer** (acts as implied rejection)
- **Case**: Dead = dead for eternity unless revived

#### Problem 1(B): Revival of Offer
- **A**: Offers Blackacre for $5,000 (30 days)
- **B**: "I will pay $4,800"
- **A**: "Cannot reduce price"
- **B**: Accepts within 30 days
- **Result**: YES - CONTRACT
- **Rule**: A's response "cannot reduce price" = continued willingness to sell at $5,000, **revives A's offer**
- **Case**: Livingston v. Evans (1925)

#### Problem 1(C): Mere Inquiry
- **A**: Offers Blackacre for $5,000 (30 days)
- **B**: "Won't you take $4,800?"
- **A**: Refuses
- **B**: Accepts within 30 days
- **Result**: YES - CONTRACT
- **Rule**: **Mere inquiry does not terminate offer** (no implied rejection)
- **Distinction**: "I'll pay $4,800" (counteroffer) vs. "Would you take $4,800?" (inquiry)

**Exam Tip**: Heavily tested on MBEs - know difference between counteroffer and mere inquiry

#### Problem 1(D): Counteroffer with Reservation
- **A**: Offers Blackacre for $5,000 (30 days)
- **B**: "I'm keeping your offer under advisement, but if you wish to close now, I'll give you $4,800"
- **A**: Refuses
- **B**: Accepts within 30 days
- **Result**: YES - CONTRACT
- **Rule**: Counteroffer acts as rejection UNLESS offeree manifests **contrary intention**
- **Analysis**: "Keeping under advisement" = not rejecting original offer while exploring alternative

#### Problem 1(E): Grumbling Acceptance
- **A**: Offers Blackacre for $5,000 (30 days)
- **B**: "I accept, but I still insist you are driving a hard bargain"
- **Result**: YES - CONTRACT
- **Rule**: **Grumbling acceptance** (expressing dissatisfaction but accepting) = valid acceptance
- **Example**: "Yes, but you're charging too much" = still acceptance

### B. Implicit vs. Additional Terms

#### Problem 2: Good Title
- **A**: Written offer to sell Blackacre
- **B**: "I accept if you can convey me good title"
- **Result**: YES - CONTRACT
- **Rule**: Providing **good title is implicit** in real estate offers - not violation of mirror image rule
- **Distinction**: "If you convey good title" (implicit) vs. "If you add tow package" (new term)

**Key Principle**: Some conditions are **implicit/given** in offers, don't constitute material changes

#### Problem 3: Indefiniteness (Express Industries)
- **Facts**: DOT offered lease renewal for $3.5M. Express signed and returned, but cover letter stated "certain parts still under discussion with HRC regarding 70,000 sq ft exclusion"
- **Later**: DOT received $4.5M offer from another party, accepted it
- **Issue**: Can Express enforce contract?
- **Trial Court & Appellate Division**: For Express (essential terms agreed)
- **Court of Appeal**: REVERSED - entire agreement **too indefinite**
- **Reasoning**:
  - Third party (HRC) needed to make decision
  - Not clear what would happen
  - Cannot enforce contract without knowing essential terms
- **Key Principle**: Court can only provide remedy if can find breach; requires valid contract with essential terms

**Equitable Remedies**: Always consider promissory estoppel/reliance damages as alternative

### C. UCC § 2-207 Applications

#### Problem 4: Additional Acknowledgement Term
- **A**: Offers sale of goods to B
- **B**: Accepts but adds "Prompt acknowledgement must be made of receipt of this letter"
- **Issue**: Is there contract? What are terms?

**Pre-UCC** (Case: Poel v. Brunswick):
- Prompt acknowledgement = qualification/condition
- Result: Counteroffer

**Post-UCC § 2-207(1)**:
- "Prompt acknowledgement" does NOT expressly condition acceptance on offeror's assent
- Result: **Contract exists**
- Additional term = proposal for addition

**If Both Merchants** (§ 2-207(2)):
- Issue: Does it materially alter contract?
- If no: Becomes part of contract
- Breach by failure to give notice = **immaterial breach** with only **nominal damages** ($1)

**If NOT Merchants**:
- Additional term = mere proposal (not part of contract)

## IV. Key Exam Concepts

### Reasonable Notice Standard
- **Central principle** for digital contracts
- Courts evaluate: Was notice **conspicuous**? Hidden? Clear opportunity to read/reject?
- Factors: Font size, placement, ability to scroll/review, opportunity to reject

### Material Alteration Test
1. Does it cause **surprise**?
2. Does it cause **hardship** (especially economic)?
3. Was party fully aware before agreeing?

### Acceptance Methods
1. **Express acceptance**: Clear "I accept"
2. **Conduct**: Using product beyond return period, keeping goods
3. **Silence**: Only when duty to speak OR custom/usage indicates acceptance
4. **Grumbling acceptance**: Complaining but accepting = valid

### Duty to Read
- General rule: Parties have duty to read contracts before signing
- Exception: Some jurisdictions (CA) require translation into buyer's language (e.g., car sales in Spanish)
- Protecting yourself: Initial each paragraph, get copies, read before signing

### Arbitration Clauses
**Benefits**:
- Cost-effective
- Faster than litigation
- Confidential

**Drawbacks**:
- Limits jury trial right
- Prevents class actions
- Potentially biased (arbitrators paid by repeat players)
- Limits damages recovery

**California Exceptions**: Sexual harassment in workplace = unenforceable

### Objective Theory Application
- How would **reasonable person** in that position interpret the language?
- Subjective intent irrelevant
- Focus on manifestation to other party

## V. Practice Tips

1. **Always argue in the alternative**: If contract claim fails, argue promissory estoppel/reliance
2. **Cover yourself**: Include multiple causes of action
3. **Look for defenses**: Economic duress, unconscionability, lack of notice
4. **Don't be afraid to ask questions**: Even experienced lawyers ask basic questions
5. **Make detailed notes**: Add personal comments to create your own outline
6. **Do practice MBEs**: Repetition reduces mistakes, reveals nuances
