# Property - Session 02

## Transcript

LAX Room 2: objects…

LAX Room 2: It even gives you practice, like, essays. It's not really practice. It is useful, you know, look, here's a question.

LAX Room 2: And I hears, like.

LAX Room 2: Last night, when I picked up Paul, which I prefer, Pharrell was, like, more on the way to… Fake.

LAX Room 2: Take a picture of it? No, I'm gonna call it?

LAX Room 2: Alright, I guess we'll get started.

LAX Room 2: Any questions from last week? I hope this'll be the last time we ever see each other in person.

LAX Room 2: Coming to this campus.

LAX Room 2: I think many of you agree, but it's nice to see you in the physical.

LAX Room 2: Except the peasants that are not here.

LAX Room 2: I didn't think he wants.

LAX Room 2: If you're taking me for evidence, then you know where I get determined from.

LAX Room 2: I like all, Professor Capacity's class.

LAX Room 2: Yeah.

LAX Room 2: So, any questions from last week?

LAX Room 2: Any questions from last week? I swear.

LAX Room 2: Anybody want to volunteer?

LAX Room 2: Nobody wants to volunteer? Sure.

LAX Room 2: Let's cool.

LAX Room 2: Let's see… If you walk in this class, This is a phone.

LAX Room 2: It's an iPhone 14.

LAX Room 2: It.

LAX Room 2: And you see, you're the only person that walks in this class.

LAX Room 2: And you see that iPhone 14.

LAX Room 2: you have to characterize that iPhone 14

LAX Room 2: As lost, it's mislaid, or it's abandoned. Not gonna say lost treasure trove. Okay.

LAX Room 2: So, how would you characterize that boat?

LAX Room 2: Without saying could, if, blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

LAX Room 2: I'd say lost, since that's not a typical place you would intend to put a phone. Okay. What's the rule for lost?

LAX Room 2: … person, has to do with intent. You intended to place it somewhere.

LAX Room 2: Is that right, Deborah?

LAX Room 2: Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I completely screwed it up. Mislaid.

LAX Room 2: It was intended to be put there. Lost is not intended to be.

LAX Room 2: Netflix. So, if you drop your phone.

LAX Room 2: Defy the universe fall up there?

LAX Room 2: So you can characterize that phone as being intentionally placed there. So someone could have lost it, someone could have a bit.

LAX Room 2: coulda, woulda, if… I don't care. Look at the natural state. What is this?

LAX Room 2: Chattel of some sort.

LAX Room 2: And… how would you characterize it?

LAX Room 2: I think it's fair to say that that is misplayed.

LAX Room 2: Because it's… it has its balance on the top of this screen.

LAX Room 2: Which shows that it was intentionally placed there.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: So…

LAX Room 2: We don't know whose phone it is, blah blah blah. So could, well, they could have, maybe they wanted someone to maybe…

LAX Room 2: don't care. All I care about is when you look at it, you find it, how would you describe it?

LAX Room 2: Without trying to, insert a lot of what-ifs, okay?

LAX Room 2: 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.

LAX Room 2: 22 people!

LAX Room 2: I think this class is capped at 30.

LAX Room 2: I said 30.

LAX Room 2: How is it?

LAX Room 2: It's a lot of people.

LAX Room 2: Is it a response?

Avi Omrany: I joined the class today, Professor.

LAX Room 2: Alright.

LAX Room 2: Okay.

LAX Room 2: I wanted my classes capped at 30. I said 30, 30, but there's 40. So, okay.

LAX Room 2: So… when…

LAX Room 2: Lost, mislaid, and abandoned are throw-in issues. So, once you start going over essays, you'll see that it's sitting worth 10 points. It's the last interrogatory of the question. So, what is the state of this?

LAX Room 2: So, I've tested on a winning lottery ticket being taped in someone's closet. Stuff buried in the ground. Money found in the restroom next to the toilet.

LAX Room 2: So, a lot of these examples, though, Could be, …

LAX Room 2: I'll bring up all three. …

LAX Room 2: initially, I don't care if you want to discuss all three, I don't care. But, if you just want to choose one and go with it, you can. Just make sure you…

LAX Room 2: Fully articulate yourself.

LAX Room 2: …

LAX Room 2: But if you want to talk about all three, you can. It's no problem. You can't lose points in this class for things you don't need. So, if you are, writing about your trip to Spain.

LAX Room 2: Nobody cares about.

LAX Room 2: I won't care. You won't get docked points. I just won't read it.

LAX Room 2: But if you talk about offer in a contract.

LAX Room 2: That'll make me happy, because it's one less thing I have to read.

LAX Room 2: So it's okay. You just won't get docked points. So if you want to talk about more than you need to, that's absolutely fine. You can absolutely do that, okay?

LAX Room 2: … I'd like to move on to the casebook. Does anybody have any questions before we move on?

LAX Room 2: But on the bar, what's the best to do? I don't… never seen this tested on a bar. Never once.

LAX Room 2: Oxy teams.

LAX Room 2: That's right.

LAX Room 2: The volatility is great.

LAX Room 2: Because you won't have anything else.

LAX Room 2: Not tested on the bar, professor, why would you… No, no, no, no. I've never seen it.

LAX Room 2: I'm gonna say it's not tested, I just haven't seen it. But, keep going.

LAX Room 2: That's all I had.

LAX Room 2: You had a question before I interrupt, what was it? What were you gonna say?

LAX Room 2: If it's not tested on the bar, then why are we learning about it?

LAX Room 2: Facebook.

LAX Room 2: Partisan tests on acquisition by capture.

LAX Room 2: I'll emphasize the things that you need to know versus what you don't really need to know. A lot of the textbook I'll just go over, because it's a lot of archaic law, and …

LAX Room 2: Frankly, just don't care very much about it.

LAX Room 2: So if we go into the casebook, we can go into the next case, which is, Del, Del… Del Mari, right? Excuse me.

LAX Room 2: Excellent.

LAX Room 2: Did you know, Miriam?

LAX Room 2: opportunity.

LAX Room 2: Della Marine? Yeah. Sorry, my apologies.

LAX Room 2: So, can anyone tell me what happens in Dela Marie?

LAX Room 2: Chimney Sweeper's boy, he was in the chimney? How old was the boy? Was he 9?

LAX Room 2: Don't recall the age, I didn't make an, … kind of forced labor of minor. I think back then, they had little kids go in the chimneys, and it was the only people who could get in.

LAX Room 2: So then he found a jewel, or a brooch. We found a jewel. Yeah. Brooach.

LAX Room 2: A jewel? What'd he find? A piece of jewelry, right? A ring?

LAX Room 2: Again, I'm Bruce.

LAX Room 2: Okay. So he found it, …

LAX Room 2: Then he took it to a goldsmith to see what it was. Yeah. I think it's a ring. Is it a ring? What did the boy find? A jewel. Who can tell me what the boy found? This is a ring.

LAX Room 2: Okay, it's just… it's a ring.

LAX Room 2: Yeah. Okay, fine, let's just move on. Found a thing. Okay.

LAX Room 2: All things.

LAX Room 2: Okay, so he found it… I think they said brooch in the text, which is a pin.

LAX Room 2: Wasn't that Hanover Spiel? Is that a safety… it's a nice pen. A fancy pin. A brute. What are you reading from? Oh, sorry, oh, I'm recalling the wrong, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, I wasn't looking at the notes. Okay, sorry, it was a jewel, a ring, my phone. So you carried it to the goldsmith to identify it, and …

LAX Room 2: Master offered him money, the boy refused, … And there was a conflict.

LAX Room 2: With regards to… No.

LAX Room 2: So, I guess the rule statement I got out of this was the final… One quick regards to that. What?

LAX Room 2: Right?

LAX Room 2: What's the conflict over? You just said a conflict in regards to that. What's that?

LAX Room 2: the finding of the… who's the rightful owner of the… So there's two people that are mad at each other. Yes. Who's mad? The boy and the goldsmith. The master, not the… Why are they mad?

LAX Room 2: …

LAX Room 2: Regarding ownership. Okay. By the courts.

LAX Room 2: really understood this case, in my opinion. Okay. The finder of property is able to keep it against all but the rightful owner.

LAX Room 2: So, I find properties that… Boss property, mislaid property.

LAX Room 2: the loss property, okay? Not mislead.

LAX Room 2: So if you find lost property, it's yours, except for the rightful owner. But it's yours. Keith.

LAX Room 2: … So, the boy found this. What did the court say? What did the court?

LAX Room 2: So, let me blow up the casebook. But the rule I said is finder a property is able to keep it all against all but the rightful owner.

LAX Room 2: It's the boys?

LAX Room 2: This is the first binder, yeah.

LAX Room 2: I never understood this, because a boy found it where?

LAX Room 2: And the chimney. The chimney doesn't belong to the boy.

LAX Room 2: Shouldn't it go to the later one?

LAX Room 2: I think that's the next way that I could just kind of go into your house and steal your food and say, I found it.

LAX Room 2: In a way. It's a bit different because it's an invitee, the person is allowed to come in.

LAX Room 2: And it was found within the scope of what this job was, but still.

LAX Room 2: If you, …

LAX Room 2: accidentally dropped your wedding ring in the toilet, and you forget about it, and you have the plumber there, and the plumber finds the wedding ring. Is it the plumber's?

LAX Room 2: In this case, I think we're not sure who the…

LAX Room 2: The jewelry belongs to him, right?

LAX Room 2: I agree, but I just think what, in this case, it really left open, …

LAX Room 2: It really left open.

LAX Room 2: Why would it not go to the land?

LAX Room 2: Found in its chimney.

LAX Room 2: Why wouldn't it go to the landlord? Because it's lost property. I think that's the next case, Hannah and Peele. It's the same problems apply. How am I supposed to go to a little boy, find this 9-year-old boy, I'm looking for this jewel, find this boy. Yes! Is it because it has not been claimed by that individual whose property it was found on? Potentially, but the perf… but….

Fatima Razavi: At the same time, if you remember where you lost, you're gonna go to that property owner, right?

LAX Room 2: Or as a property organization. I gave it to the little boy!

Fatima Razavi: Professor, could it be because it's in the chimney, and the chimney's considered trash, and things get burned there, and it's kind of relative to your trash bag?

LAX Room 2: Really, really project yourself. There's a lot of fans going in here, we can't hear you.

Fatima Razavi: Is it because it's in the chimney?

Fatima Razavi: And the chimney is where, like, you burn things, so automatically you think it's trash.

LAX Room 2: Well, it's still my property, right?

Fatima Razavi: Yeah, but it's like the explanation you said with the trash bag, if it's next to or laying next to the trash, perhaps it's meant to be lost.

LAX Room 2: Maybe, but at the same time, it's still my property. I want people going through.

Fatima Razavi: abandoned.

LAX Room 2: It's not attached to the property, it's a bug.

LAX Room 2: It's all my property, right? It's not part of… not part of my property that's in my chimney? Yeah. Is my chimney not my property? I think…

LAX Room 2: No. I think if it's on top of your property, it's… On top… so if it's on the roof, it's not my property?

LAX Room 2: So if homeless people could just go on my roof and sleep on my roof, it's not my… it's not your property.

LAX Room 2: I'll let you know, that is my property, okay? That is definitely my property. No one's going on my roof to sleep. It's my property, okay?

LAX Room 2: I, I, I don't really understand,

LAX Room 2: the whole rationale behind this case, I think, did kind of a poor job.

LAX Room 2: I'm not really sure, but I'm assuming that the law, in these olden days, it would go to the finder, but I think it would be different today, because it would likely go to the landowner, because

LAX Room 2: Individuals who lose property are going to go to the landowner or occupier to claim their lost property, right?

LAX Room 2: Same thing goes for mislayed products.

LAX Room 2: Characterized as loss, because It's kind of hard to imagine how you intentionally place This jewel inside the chimney.

LAX Room 2: Looks like it was unintentionally placed there. So it's really the meat of the coconut is, …

LAX Room 2: Is that it was unintentionally placed there.

LAX Room 2: So it's characterized as lost, proper. Questions?

Dove night: Can I answer a question? So, the… Joe does.

LAX Room 2: Matter.

Dove night: Pardon me.

Dove night: Hello?

LAX Room 2: Yeah, louder! Speak louder!

Dove night: Okay.

Dove night: And so the jewel…

Dove night: Does it go to the sweeper boy, or does it go to the, owner?

Dove night: Hello?

LAX Room 2: Chimney Sweeper, I was asking, is it gonna go Chimney Sweeper, the owner?

LAX Room 2: The boy is the sweeper, isn't it?

LAX Room 2: The boy is the sweeper.

Dove night: Thank you.

LAX Room 2: Any other questions?

Yessenia Soria: Professor, I have a question, it's Yesenia.

Yessenia Soria: So, because this case is older, it's called… it's considered laws, finders, keepers, but in the new law of today, since we have property rights, like the chimney at…

Yessenia Soria: belongs to my house. Will that be considered my property, or the person that's cleaned the chimney found that it's his?

LAX Room 2: Is it because there's a dispute of, like, who's the owner? Is it because there's a dispute of… I hear you. Is it because there is a dispute of who the owner is of that jewel? It's lost, right? Yeah. So you don't know if the homeowner is the actual owner of that prior, or if it's a prior… Sure.

LAX Room 2: So, I mean, I could see it go both ways. It could go to the boy, because if he…

LAX Room 2: Don't know who it may be.

LAX Room 2: Sure. The problem, though, is that

LAX Room 2: Graph until someone comes looking for.

LAX Room 2: So a problem arises in that situation. But, look.

LAX Room 2: I don't really care what you say about who it goes to. I could care less. You could say it goes to Santa Claus. I don't care. I want you to tell me if it's lost, displayed, or abandoned. Everything else is all sweet nothings to me.

Yessenia Soria: Well, I think it's lost.

Yessenia Soria: But that.

LAX Room 2: Can I say that? I said that, right? I think the case said that, too.

Yessenia Soria: Yes, it did, but my question was…

Yessenia Soria: Because this is old law, an old penis.

Yessenia Soria: Does that mean it's finders' rights because of the child finding it in the chimney? If it was to be new, all, like, right now, someone sweeping my chimney, would it also be finer's keepers, or would it be the property owner's jewelry?

LAX Room 2: As far as right now, I have not given you any law.

LAX Room 2: to the contrary, From what we're learning in this case. And I do not plan to.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, got it.

LAX Room 2: Anything else?

LAX Room 2: I guess we'll go into the next case of the reading. I do think that notes are very important. I'm just kind of…

LAX Room 2: not going forward them as much. But there are some interesting situations where, you know, property found in a hotel room

LAX Room 2: the hotel.

LAX Room 2: Not the housekeeper, or the cleaning people.

LAX Room 2: … Stuck down on airplanes, etc, etc.

LAX Room 2: Let's move into the next case, which is, Hanna versus Peel.

LAX Room 2: And… zips.

LAX Room 2: This is an interesting case.

LAX Room 2: Because this somewhat gives the answer to the last case.

LAX Room 2: It's kind of an exception.

LAX Room 2: Which confuses me about Del Marie… Murie. Dela Marieurie.

LAX Room 2: Sorry.

LAX Room 2: So, Hannah versus Peel involved 8.

LAX Room 2: Roach.

LAX Room 2: Who can help me with it?

LAX Room 2: So, Peel was granted ownership of the house, but there was no…

LAX Room 2: Proof that he'd lived in the house for… Since he had ownership.

LAX Room 2: And in 1940, when, … The house was requisitioned for the quartering of soldiers.

LAX Room 2: Hannah, who was the plaintiff.

LAX Room 2: Found a brooch in the house.

LAX Room 2: And Anna reported his findings.

LAX Room 2: In the windows, though.

LAX Room 2: … He reported the growth to the police.

LAX Room 2: Who held the broach for 2 years. What an honest citizen.

LAX Room 2: I'm an idiot, but okay.

LAX Room 2: They held it for about 2 years, and when the owner wasn't found, they gave the brooch to…

LAX Room 2: field, who was… owner of the land, and he… and Hannah sued for the return of Nope.

LAX Room 2: Can you describe this brooch? So, it's on a windowsill, right? Yeah. Okay. And can you describe, like, did this opinion characterize what was going on wrong around this brooch? Describe, like, things?

LAX Room 2: pop whoops.

LAX Room 2: I agree.

LAX Room 2: It was dirty, it was dusty, cobwebs. So what is that an indication of? It was… it was abandoned.

LAX Room 2: It's been for a long time.

LAX Room 2: I know that.

LAX Room 2: There's… I put something down right now.

LAX Room 2: It's not gonna get cobweed and dusty.

LAX Room 2: How long do cobwebs take? I would say at least a month.

LAX Room 2: And if somebody hasn't… At least a month. Awful.

LAX Room 2: I'm actually with people on the beach here. We know that!

LAX Room 2: People are living.

LAX Room 2: How long does it take for cobwebs to, to, to, to, to form? Anybody know?

LAX Room 2: What kinds of plastic ounces?

LAX Room 2: Not right away. I've been occupied, so it must have been a long time.

LAX Room 2: Is the presence of cobwebs, though.

LAX Room 2: indication that it's been there for a long time. I…

LAX Room 2: Sure, but I would dispute that, because how long do comp webs take?

LAX Room 2: And I, look, I don't know, I'm just saying, I don't know, like… I'm just saying. I don't know.

LAX Room 2: But…

LAX Room 2: If I don't know how long cobwebs take, I can't say it's been there for a long time.

LAX Room 2: Okay? Now, I do have some differences of opinion here.

LAX Room 2: because this… Roach?

LAX Room 2: Which I thought was a ring.

LAX Room 2: for years.

LAX Room 2: Until about 2020, someone said, I think it's a pin.

LAX Room 2: So, …

LAX Room 2: The brooch was found on a window sill.

LAX Room 2: Right?

LAX Room 2: I have a little bit of issues with the characterization of this being lost, because that's what the opinion says, that it was lost.

LAX Room 2: Looks… if something is on a windowsill, it tells me that it was intentionally placed there, okay? Now there's a bunch of blah blah blah about, well, it was on the ground, but anyways, it somehow made its way to a windowsill, right?

LAX Room 2: Okay.

LAX Room 2: So that's why I have a little bit of, …

LAX Room 2: Issues with the characterization of this being lost.

LAX Room 2: Property. But fine, we'll go with it.

LAX Room 2: … And I do recall that the opinion

LAX Room 2: Doesn't really articulate very well about how their computing is lost.

LAX Room 2: I think it's more abrupt, saying, therefore, this is lost.

LAX Room 2: If I'm not mistaken.

LAX Room 2: … Nonetheless… The general rule, though, is that lost property is going to go to the landowner, right?

LAX Room 2: But this court carved out an exception to balance.

LAX Room 2: in situations.

LAX Room 2: Where?

LAX Room 2: The landowner has never been there.

LAX Room 2: So, in that situation.

LAX Room 2: If the rightful owner were to go back to the landowner to look for this broach, if the landowner has never occupied or been on this property, they're not gonna know.

LAX Room 2: So there's that…

LAX Room 2: That if the landowner has never been to this location, it's going to go to the finder.

LAX Room 2: M.

LAX Room 2: You can kind of see that the opinion is tailored to

LAX Room 2: rewarding the finder of this property, because, after all, they did turn it in, so it really incentivizes people to turn things in. It could be honest citizens.

LAX Room 2: Right?

LAX Room 2: Because we are all honest citizens.

LAX Room 2: Okay? You find a bag of money, you turn it in.

LAX Room 2: So you can kind of see that the opinion is… Geared towards that.

LAX Room 2: So, what we're extracting from this case is that… or…

LAX Room 2: The court, not myself. I disagree. Characterize this property as lost.

LAX Room 2: The general rule is lost property is going to go to the landowner, because the landowner is likely to go… the owner of the property, true owner, is likely to go to the landowner to search for their property.

LAX Room 2: But… Exception is that the landowner has never been on the property before.

LAX Room 2: And in that instance, it goes to the Finder. Finders keep this. And the finder, it's the finder's

LAX Room 2: They have absolute title, except over the true one.

LAX Room 2: Sense?

LAX Room 2: Questions?

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor, I have a question.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor?

Agnes Gholoonian: So, I…

Agnes Gholoonian: I have a problem with this case, because it doesn't make sense to me why the owner of the house wouldn't have the right to the property, because I….

LAX Room 2: water.

LAX Room 2: Louder.

Agnes Gholoonian: I agree.

LAX Room 2: Blow our eardrums out. We got 3 fans in this room. It's like 3 jet engines in here.

LAX Room 2: Okay.

Agnes Gholoonian: I'm saying that I don't understand why the owner of the house would not have the right to the property.

LAX Room 2: When he purchased the land, although he never stepped foot on the land, he still did purchase the land. It was abandoned by the previous owner.

LAX Room 2: wasn't abandoned. It was characterized as lost.

Agnes Gholoonian: I believe it was abandoned because he purchased the land, and he purchased everything that came with the house, I would assume, if you're purchasing a house, right?

LAX Room 2: Well, that's just not what the court said, right? It said it was lost.

Agnes Gholoonian: Is it lost, or is it abandoned?

LAX Room 2: My position is that it's mislane. That would be my position.

LAX Room 2: But…

LAX Room 2: I'm not always perfect, I know you guys think that I am, but I'm not. I do have some flaws.

LAX Room 2: Believe it or not.

LAX Room 2: But in my position, is I think it's mislaid, because I have a problem of how this brooch got on a windowsill. How do you drop a brooch and it goes up on a windowsill?

LAX Room 2: It is on a windowsill!

LAX Room 2: Tells me that someone intentionally placed it on the windowsill.

LAX Room 2: If I drop this, oh, it's not gonna go on the windowsill, okay?

LAX Room 2: So…

LAX Room 2: I have problems with that, but if you just tell me this, okay? Explain to us all why you think that this broach

LAX Room 2: is abandoned.

Agnes Gholoonian: Because if you're selling a house, you're going to get whatever you can from that house and leave the premises, right? You're not….

LAX Room 2: The problem, though, is this.

LAX Room 2: You don't know who the brooch belongs to, right?

LAX Room 2: So, how do you articulate yourself that the true owner of this brooch

LAX Room 2: Intentionally relinquish their interest in this brooch.

LAX Room 2: I don't care.

LAX Room 2: it's not a…

LAX Room 2: It's not left next to the garbage. It's not a sign that says, please take this mattress.

Agnes Gholoonian: Right.

LAX Room 2: That, so….

Agnes Gholoonian: Something?

LAX Room 2: How would you explain that it's abandoned.

Agnes Gholoonian: I don't understand why we have to care about the previous owner of that house. Like, it just… it doesn't make sense to me. The house was purchased, somebody bought the property. So if I go and buy a property right now, and the previous owner left, like, a strainer or something in the kitchen, or a pot in the kitchen.

Agnes Gholoonian: Like, it's… it's mine now.

Agnes Gholoonian: Doesn't matter if I'm gonna step foot in it or not, it's mine. I purchased that property and the house and everything in it that's been left behind, which I believe is abandoned at that point, because you're leaving the premises, you're selling it, it's no longer in your possession, you've abandoned it.

LAX Room 2: But isn't it voluntarily giving it up? How do you voluntarily just…

LAX Room 2: The rule for abandonment. Property to which the true owner has voluntarily given up any claim of ownership.

Agnes Gholoonian: Which, which they did, because they sold the house.

LAX Room 2: You don't know if this property belongs to the prior owner of the house, or property owner. It could be something. Guess who knows?

Agnes Gholoonian: Hold on, I thought, I thought… well, what was his name? Hold on.

Agnes Gholoonian: Who is the guy who owned the house now?

LAX Room 2: Major appeal.

Agnes Gholoonian: I thought Major Appeal purchased the house.

LAX Room 2: Yes.

Agnes Gholoonian: Right? So, okay, they… it's been purchased. I don't understand why we have to…

Agnes Gholoonian: like, it's done. Like, the previous owner… sold it, right? Somebody….

LAX Room 2: Yes, it's mine. You, you, by… based on the sale, everything here is mine.

LAX Room 2: As is.

LAX Room 2: The problem, though, is… I get your point. I'm actually impressed with your point, because no one in 11 years of me teaching this class has actually said this.

LAX Room 2: So… You're definitely making me think.

LAX Room 2: … But… Problem, though, is you can't say that the prior owner

LAX Room 2: Is the owner of the brooch.

LAX Room 2: It could have been lost while the prior owner

LAX Room 2: could have been a, he could. We can't attribute the ownership of this approach to the prior owner, because there is evidence that,

LAX Room 2: Military men or soldiers were, staying at this residence.

Agnes Gholoonian: Yeah, but it wasn't because of… there… isn't there… wasn't there, like, a rule that, like.

Agnes Gholoonian: because it's wartime, if they needed to stay in a house, or to seek shelter, or whatever, or use property for however the way they need to use it, they have that ability to do it. So it wasn't because, like, the owner of the… of the place was like, no, please come stay at my house, soldiers. Like, it was just a property, and military men needed it, they used it. That was….

LAX Room 2: I don't see how that changes the analysis if someone's having forced soldiers versus voluntarily allowing them.

Agnes Gholoonian: wait, I thought… hold on, did I misunderstand this? I thought at the end, the court found those finders

Agnes Gholoonian: the… it was the finder's brooch, right? It wasn't….

LAX Room 2: Yeah, Finder gets it, yes. So whoever found it, it's theirs.

Agnes Gholoonian: And Hannah, who was the….

LAX Room 2: property owner.

Agnes Gholoonian: No, wait, Hannah's the property owner?

LAX Room 2: Yeah, I'm sorry, yeah, Peel.

Agnes Gholoonian: heel is the property. Hannah shouldn't have the rightful

Agnes Gholoonian: ownership to that… to the brooch, because it was in Peel's property.

LAX Room 2: That's just the finder, but this is the… it carved out the exception.

LAX Room 2: Because Peel never has been on the property.

Agnes Gholoonian: But I'm saying that shouldn't matter.

Agnes Gholoonian: Why does people….

LAX Room 2: agree with you, and you're melting my heart by these arguments. I'd just go with what the case says, but….

Agnes Gholoonian: I'm telling you, it does.

LAX Room 2: Hey, I love that you're thinking about it. There's a bunch of hands going up. What'd it have to do? Because it's an unattached item? Louder. Is it because it's an louder? How much louder? Scream it. Nevermind, I'm good.

LAX Room 2: So, would it have been different had he been to the house? Because the rule I read is a man possesses everything which is attached or under his land, but a man does not necessarily possess a thing which is lying unattached on the surface of his land, even though the thing is possessed by someone else.

LAX Room 2: Yeah. Attached to. No, it's lying on top.

LAX Room 2: Yeah.

LAX Room 2: But, like, but going back to the chimney case, the same thing, it was just…

LAX Room 2: Well, I mean, I wouldn't say that that's attached to the land, either. Yeah.

LAX Room 2: Can we move on?

Agnes Gholoonian: Yeah.

LAX Room 2: Mr. Speeds.

LAX Room 2: A lot of questions, it's okay, I like it. In about 2-3 weeks, it's gonna be suck.

LAX Room 2: We're gonna go like this.

LAX Room 2: It's real quiet.

LAX Room 2: Believe me.

LAX Room 2: … So…

LAX Room 2: Let's move on to the next case. I'd like to go into the notes, but just in the interest of time, I'll go into the next case.

LAX Room 2: It's, …

LAX Room 2: of mirroring its, … Medina? Devoy versus Medina? Yeah.

LAX Room 2: McCoy. Is it McCoy? McCoy. Absolutely. Versus Medina, correct?

LAX Room 2: Okay, so be very quick.

LAX Room 2: So who can explain to me about this case?

LAX Room 2: I could go ahead.

LAX Room 2: So, essentially, a customer was in a barbershop, and he had found a pocketbook.

LAX Room 2: He had found a pocketbook left on the table, and he had handed it to the… to the barber, to find the owner. However, the owner never claimed it, never appeared, so he… the plaintiff had demanded it back 3 times, and the defendant just did not want to give it back to him.

LAX Room 2: The two guys are mad. One's getting a haircut, finds this pocketbook. The barber wants it.

LAX Room 2: All right.

LAX Room 2: So tell me this.

LAX Room 2: Is this… it's a pocketbook, or what? It's a pocketbook, right?

LAX Room 2: Pocketbook? Or a wallet? Wallet. Yeah. It's a thing. Okay, it's a thing. Let's say thing, alright? It's a thing that someone wants. …

LAX Room 2: this thing… How would you characterize this thing?

LAX Room 2: As it's found.

LAX Room 2: Ms. I'm so funny! I asked for volunteers! You had your hand raised! You did it! And I hear all these other voices.

LAX Room 2: Go ahead. I would say it's mislaid, because he… Essentially, you're…

LAX Room 2: It's so quiet in this class in 3 weeks. Can't wait. It's like vacation! But…

LAX Room 2: So I think it's mislaid, because… It's… the owner…

LAX Room 2: I think he had the intention of putting it back on the table. Where's it found? On a table.

LAX Room 2: I think it was just left there. So, here's the phone. Let's just say it's the thing. It's there.

LAX Room 2: was that pocketbook? It was on a table, right? Was it in front of the, customer?

LAX Room 2: I forget. But nonetheless.

LAX Room 2: it was on some type of table, which evidences unintentional placement, intentional placement, or I'm voluntarily relinquishing all interest in this money, or this iPhone 14.

LAX Room 2: I think it was intentionally placed there with the intention of putting the wallet back into whatever pocket first ever it was. Yeah. So, …

LAX Room 2: I put this here.

LAX Room 2: Probably with the intentions of coming back for that phone.

LAX Room 2: So I lose that phone, what happens?

LAX Room 2: My life is over.

LAX Room 2: Okay, that's what happens, right? So it happens. Like so.

LAX Room 2: Thanks, Phil.

LAX Room 2: So, you're correct.

LAX Room 2: This pocketbook, or there's chattel, was placed

LAX Room 2: On a table, which evidences that it was… It was mislain.

LAX Room 2: It was intentionally placed in, which means that if

LAX Room 2: Property is this late, intentionally placed somewhere.

LAX Room 2: The owner of that pocketbook is going to go back to the barbershop and say, did you find this pocketbook or wallet?

LAX Room 2: Don't go to the lander.

LAX Room 2: Questions?

Dove night: The question I have is… so this… let's talk a bit… The question I… okay.

Dove night: This….

LAX Room 2: Wow, we can't hear you.

Dove night: Hello?

Dove night: Hello? Okay. This pocketbook will go back, ….

LAX Room 2: To the rightful owner.

LAX Room 2: Can you repeat the question?

Dove night: Does this pocketbook go back to the rifle owner if they don't find it?

LAX Room 2: If they don't find it?

Dove night: Yes.

LAX Room 2: If they don't find the pocketbook, or they don't find what….

Dove night: Oh, they don't come back to pick it up.

LAX Room 2: Who's there?

Dove night: Oh, sorry.

LAX Room 2: So, what I'm saying is this.

LAX Room 2: You're coming back for your wallet.

LAX Room 2: What's the question?

Dove night: If he doesn't come back for the wallet, does it go to… the owner of.

LAX Room 2: Okay, I understand what you're standing.

LAX Room 2: It's beyond the scope of this class. You're supposed to notify law enforcement, or alternatively use reasonable efforts to locate the true owner, but

LAX Room 2: this… The extent of what we are learning is… The landowner gets it.

LAX Room 2: No.

LAX Room 2: Okay.

Dove night: Okay.

LAX Room 2: Anything else?

Fatima Razavi: Professor, sorry, can we go back to the brooch thing? So, let's say with the barber, can you hear me?

LAX Room 2: We would love it if you were louder.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, the barber's.

LAX Room 2: You are on top of the world, so just absolutely let us have it.

Fatima Razavi: So…

Fatima Razavi: If the barber, just to go back to the brooch scenario, to make sure I understand, if the barber had never been in his office, in his shop, and the client found the wallet, or the pocketbook, it would have automatically been his.

LAX Room 2: the, … the customer?

Fatima Razavi: Yes.

LAX Room 2: That's different, because Hanna vs. Peel was limited to lost property.

LAX Room 2: It did mention mislaid problems.

LAX Room 2: Would the analysis change?

LAX Room 2: If the landlord had never been there? Maybe not. Maybe, maybe not. I seem to think it would probably be the same. The same rationale would apply, I think.

Fatima Razavi: You're saying the brooch… the brooch was mislayed, and the.

LAX Room 2: The brooch? You're talking about Hanna versus Peel, right?

Fatima Razavi: Yes, let me go back.

LAX Room 2: was lost.

LAX Room 2: That was lost property.

Fatima Razavi: Okay.

LAX Room 2: This case, it's mislaid property.

Fatima Razavi: Okay.

LAX Room 2: So, what's your question?

Fatima Razavi: I have to think about that, then. Alright.

Fatima Razavi: I was putting them at the same.

LAX Room 2: And you're….

Fatima Razavi: I'll have to get back to you on that. I have to think about the difference between the two.

LAX Room 2: Okay, alright.

LAX Room 2: I'm sorry if I keep saying louder, I can't hear you with these fans.

LAX Room 2: Did anybody have a problem hearing?

LAX Room 2: No one should ever have a problem here, because I'm always yelling. Yeah.

LAX Room 2: Does it make a difference that the person that found the broach is an octopic one?

LAX Room 2: Like, in this situation.

LAX Room 2: The customer is a phenomenal.

LAX Room 2: Absolutely.

LAX Room 2: Otherwise… I'm going to your house tonight, and I'm getting your stuff.

LAX Room 2: I'm taking your stuff. I'm gonna make it my stuff.

LAX Room 2: They're not trespassers.

LAX Room 2: There's nothing in these cases that we're learning that rewards a trespasser. If it did, then I'd be at your house.

LAX Room 2: Looking through door stuff.

LAX Room 2: You hire the plum… the plumber's going through your drawers.

LAX Room 2: get the hell out. So that's… no, that would be trespassing.

LAX Room 2: So, it's, … When I initially started lecturing on this, I wanted you to make sure that you understood

LAX Room 2: Does the person have the right to be there? Is this person a trespasser?

LAX Room 2: And we went into acquisition by capture. Remember the fox? It's just hunting season, they're not going, they're not trespassing on people's lawn, property.

LAX Room 2: So it's very important.

LAX Room 2: To ensure that the individual finder of anything, or capture, is not a trespasser.

LAX Room 2: Because the law is not going to reward a trespasser.

LAX Room 2: If not… Any other questions?

LAX Room 2: If we're in public, it wouldn't matter. On the street.

LAX Room 2: Show me a piece of law that says I'm trespassing on public property.

LAX Room 2: Trespassing in this park that you pay for.

LAX Room 2: No, I mean in regards to lost property. Sidewalk. Can't be on the sidewalk? You pay for it.

LAX Room 2: Go ahead. I just meant in regards to lost property, yeah. Oh, public? It's fair game. Very game. Very games. Find out in the park, find… Absolutely.

LAX Room 2: ARC… Sidewalk.

LAX Room 2: Technically, City Hall is public property.

LAX Room 2: Thanks. Y'all a public record.

LAX Room 2: I pay for it.

LAX Room 2: you pay for it, right? But you can… you can say the same thing, like, okay, we were at a park, and the wallet was left on a table at the park. How would that apply differently?

LAX Room 2: It wouldn't.

LAX Room 2: it's still characterized as lost, mislayed, abandoned. The only question is, is where would it go to?

LAX Room 2: Since there's no landowner, there's a… duty.

LAX Room 2: That honest citizens should turn it in.

LAX Room 2: … But that's a little bit beyond the scope of this month's.

LAX Room 2: Because I think that… If it's not characterized as abandoned property, and you… take it.

LAX Room 2: And you convert it into your home.

LAX Room 2: Potentially trespassed chattel, could be a conversion of some sort, right? Some type of tort, right?

LAX Room 2: Great.

LAX Room 2: Want to make the movements over here?

LAX Room 2: Any questions before we move on to the next, section of the book?

LAX Room 2: Pretty well.

LAX Room 2: The next part of the casebook is going into adverse possession.

LAX Room 2: Adverse possession is very commonly tested. I've never had a final exam, I've never seen a final exam that does not have adverse possession.

LAX Room 2: Historically, students tend to get very, confident in it.

LAX Room 2: Okay? Just get very confident, I feel really good about it, it's easy, it's elemental, blah, blah, blah, but fall on their face on the final.

LAX Room 2: Big time.

LAX Room 2: So do not get overly confident in this, because I will whack you hard, okay?

LAX Room 2: Big time.

LAX Room 2: … adverse possession Is possessing property adverse to the true owner?

LAX Room 2: Very commonly tested. Test it on the bar. Test it on the bar.

LAX Room 2: Every about 6 years.

LAX Room 2: In essence.

LAX Room 2: You will have a multiple choice question on it.

LAX Room 2: At least one, maybe two.

LAX Room 2: a few more. It comes up on essays once… … Alright, 6 years.

LAX Room 2: Very commonly tested. Very commonly tested this semester, too.

LAX Room 2: concept is not very hard, to grasp. It is at first.

LAX Room 2: But I want you to understand that adverse possession, the whole concept and rationale behind it, is not to reward a trespasser.

LAX Room 2: But rather to punish The true owner from sleeping on their rights.

LAX Room 2: You don't find this anywhere.

LAX Room 2: Sort of.

LAX Room 2: But the government wants people to use their property. The government wants property occupied.

LAX Room 2: Why?

LAX Room 2: No problem.

LAX Room 2: What do you mean, property tax? What does that mean?

LAX Room 2: Louder development pay for the problem.

LAX Room 2: If I'm not living there, I'm not gonna pay the problem.

LAX Room 2: Well, you're gonna sell it!

LAX Room 2: Potentially for more money!

LAX Room 2: Yeah. And when someone buys it for more money, they pay more than what? Yes, taxes!

LAX Room 2: if you have garbage everywhere, no one's going to want to buy it. So there is, laws written

LAX Room 2: to, … punish.

LAX Room 2: True owners that sleep on their rights.

LAX Room 2: So, adverse possession.

LAX Room 2: Don't complicate leads.

LAX Room 2: All it is, is someone… Or some people.

LAX Room 2: Or an entity of some sort Trespassing.

LAX Room 2: Onto someone else's land.

LAX Room 2: And situating itself, themselves, or him or herself.

LAX Room 2: Situating themselves there for a… Period of time.

LAX Room 2: adverse possession, You don't have to be intentionally trying to invade someone's land. It could be accidental.

LAX Room 2: Hey, Joey, can I build this fence between our properties? Yeah, no problem. But my neighbor accidentally invades my property by three and a half feet.

LAX Room 2: It's accidental. Oh, it's so sad, it was just an accident!

LAX Room 2: My neighbor may have just taken my property, okay? If…

LAX Room 2: That fence is there for a…

LAX Room 2: 5 years, 3 years, 10 years, 20 years, 100 centuries, doesn't matter. Certain period of time, okay?

LAX Room 2: So just think of… Someone or something invading… Someone else's property.

LAX Room 2: Are they a trespasser?

LAX Room 2: That's it!

LAX Room 2: Trespassing onto someone's land, and just being there for a certain period of time.

LAX Room 2: Don't complicated.

LAX Room 2: Just going on to someone else's land.

LAX Room 2: Accident, intentional, I don't care. Just going on to someone else's land, and situating themselves and occupying it.

LAX Room 2: Well, what happens if, you don't actually physically go on it, you just look at it?

LAX Room 2: Yeah? Well, I just adversely possessed the White House.

LAX Room 2: It's mine! Get out!

LAX Room 2: Now, you can't trespass the eyes, okay?

LAX Room 2: Do not trespass lies.

LAX Room 2: You can't look! What do you mean I can't look?

LAX Room 2: Oh, I'll just close my eyes.

LAX Room 2: Can't trespass the eyes, okay? So…

LAX Room 2: There must be some type of physical invasion of the property.

LAX Room 2: I'm building a swimming pool from.

LAX Room 2: I decided to grow marijuana on your property.

LAX Room 2: I decided to sell crack cocaine all day on your property, okay? And that… Matt?

LAX Room 2: I decided to build a, a, a, … An outhouse on your property.

LAX Room 2: Decided to build a garage on your property.

LAX Room 2: I'm so sorry. I thought this property was abandoned.

LAX Room 2: So I moved on, I built a home, and I've been here for 10 years.

LAX Room 2: This is mine.

LAX Room 2: So next time your neighbor says, hey, can I build this, like, fence over here?

LAX Room 2: It's like, yeah, but, …

LAX Room 2: you want to make sure, okay? You want to make sure that, if they do invade your property, you might have to reject them.

LAX Room 2: Because failing to do something Would, potentially cause you to lose that part of your property.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: No.

LAX Room 2: Remember, the whole… Intentions behind it is trespassing.

LAX Room 2: So, if you permit someone to be on your property, It's not a trespass!

LAX Room 2: Hey, Bill, come on by! We'll play ping pong!

LAX Room 2: Is Bill a trespasser?

LAX Room 2: Bill comes over and plays game-on?

LAX Room 2: Bill is not a trespasser.

LAX Room 2: Bill, get off my property now!

LAX Room 2: Well, you invited me. I'm here to stay. No, Bill is now a trespasser.

LAX Room 2: You got problems with your Wi-Fi, I know, you gotta call, you know, whatever, AT&T, whoever you use.

LAX Room 2: And they're fixing it for you.

LAX Room 2: And then you find them, like, looking through your drawers.

LAX Room 2: Get out. They are now a trespasser.

LAX Room 2: Okay? They are now a trespass.

LAX Room 2: It's really funny. It's funny to me, but everyone always likes to get creative Wi-Fi's.

LAX Room 2: creative, like a funny Wi-Fi name. Mine's a little bit too far as I'm aging, but when I was younger, it's okay. But now that I'm getting older, I…

LAX Room 2: It's pretty bad, … But, …

LAX Room 2: everyone likes to get creative, but I just, I said registered sex offender. So, yeah, it's still this day. Because when I moved into my house, I was setting up the internet. The guy was like, well, I'll see you later! See you later!

LAX Room 2: That was weird. Yeah, to this day, it still is. Still is, still is registered sex offended.

LAX Room 2: But I have to tell my neighbors, no, no, no, no, no, I'm not a sex with them. Yeah. Not gonna fight.

LAX Room 2: … Has, you know.

LAX Room 2: when I first moved in, there was some high school girls across the street. I tell them, look, I'm not, but… Anyways, that's the sex offender story.

LAX Room 2: Registered sex offender, okay?

LAX Room 2: Well, I'm a criminal defense attorney, so it's funny to me, okay? I laugh.

LAX Room 2: So, adverse possession.

LAX Room 2: It is none other than a trespass.

LAX Room 2: Good luck.

LAX Room 2: to establish… adverse possession.

LAX Room 2: The individual or individuals, or entity

LAX Room 2: Who is claiming, now, ownership of the land.

LAX Room 2: Has to satisfy the elements of adverse possession.

LAX Room 2: Maybe tonight.

LAX Room 2: We will get to that one point, because remember I told you about that very, very, very bright student that was a Navy fighter pilot?

LAX Room 2: It's this issue he could not understand. Other than that, he could have taught this entire class.

LAX Room 2: But I will tell you what that is.

LAX Room 2: There are elements.

LAX Room 2: to adverse possession.

LAX Room 2: The best way to format any response

LAX Room 2: For example, in an essay is what I gave you in the material. If you go to my notes.

LAX Room 2: There's gonna be a section that says, Suggested Approach.

LAX Room 2: It's not mandated.

LAX Room 2: Okay? Those are questions to ask yourself. You don't always have to answer them, but those are definite questions that you ask yourself every time.

LAX Room 2: Yeah.

LAX Room 2: supplemental sources will have different elements, they'll say different things, they'll combine them, blah blah blah. I'm simply going off what your casebook is saying.

LAX Room 2: Okay? We're going… Through the casebook universe.

LAX Room 2: Now… an individual Individuals, or entity, or even entities, okay?

LAX Room 2: Who wish to succeed to adverse profession must prove the following, and we will go in detail of all of them.

LAX Room 2: pre-COVID and pre-matrix, I would actually write it on the board here. I don't know if I'm capable of doing that. I see.

LAX Room 2: So, for those that, you know, are not physically here, can you see this board?

LAX Room 2: Hi, you see that?

Leanna Badar: Yes.

LAX Room 2: Huh. Can you guys see that okay?

Dove night: Yeah, you can see.

LAX Room 2: Is it on your screen, or do you have to actually see it through the cameras?

Dove night: It's on my screen.

LAX Room 2: Someone logged into Zoom right now?

Fatima Razavi: It's on our screen, Professor.

Fatima Razavi: We can see it.

LAX Room 2: Is someone on Zoom right now? Is there anyone in this room on Zoom right now?

LAX Room 2: There's no one? Okay.

LAX Room 2: So it's on your screen, so you don't have to look through that camera all the way to the screen. It's on your screen, right?

Fatima Razavi: Yes, it's on our screen.

LAX Room 2: Alright.

LAX Room 2: Alright.

LAX Room 2: So think of it like this, so there is a piece of land, okay?

LAX Room 2: Blackacre.

LAX Room 2: Yep.

LAX Room 2: And someone is invading Blackacre and doing something and building a house, okay? And then a swimming pool, and then a garage.

LAX Room 2: Okay? They're occupying this.

LAX Room 2: This square, Black Acre, belongs to someone else. Someone else has title to this.

LAX Room 2: If this person… stays here.

LAX Room 2: For a certain amount of time.

LAX Room 2: without consent, The property is theirs.

LAX Room 2: So, in order to find this.

LAX Room 2: You have to establish the following.

LAX Room 2: We can't read that through my notes.

LAX Room 2: There must be actual occupancy, okay?

LAX Room 2: There must be a physical invasion on the land. You can't look at something, okay? That's mine.

LAX Room 2: I'm looking at it. Soft first.

LAX Room 2: There must be a physical invasion on the property.

LAX Room 2: On the property.

LAX Room 2: Oftentimes, it's building something, it's making use of the property, okay?

LAX Room 2: There's some type of physical occupancy on the property, okay?

LAX Room 2: Now, for actual occupancy.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: You can only claim Okay? This is Black Acre.

LAX Room 2: If you use… This part of the property.

LAX Room 2: You with me so far, or should I slow down?

LAX Room 2: No, wait, slow down, I'm still drawing it.

LAX Room 2: If you succeed, and you are only occupying that much.

LAX Room 2: Then you only succeed to that of what you occupy.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: You can't claim all of the property. It's only what you occupy.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: So if I'm occupying the outhouse, I can only claim the outhouse.

LAX Room 2: I can't claim the mansion.

LAX Room 2: Okay, yeah. When you say occupy, you mean just physical presence, or actually improving? Physical occupation. Not affecting it physically with, like, making improvements, or… Making… what?

LAX Room 2: Doing anything to the land, or do you just have to be there?

LAX Room 2: That happens.

LAX Room 2: You can't…

LAX Room 2: just go on there and have a water balloon fight and walk off, okay? There must be some type of…

LAX Room 2: Use of the property.

LAX Room 2: Are you using this property like a reasonable owner would use this property? Are you improving it in some way?

LAX Room 2: Okay, because if you're just having water balloon fights, that's not… no.

LAX Room 2: A water balloon fight.

LAX Room 2: Okay.

LAX Room 2: So, you must physically Physically, okay? So look for things of someone growing crops, or farming, or, …

LAX Room 2: Improving a house.

LAX Room 2: Building a house.

LAX Room 2: I usually say barn, house, blah blah blah, okay? A physical occupancy, okay?

LAX Room 2: Because for trespass, you have to physically go on the land, right?

LAX Room 2: There you go. So it's just now a constant.

LAX Room 2: Trespass.

LAX Room 2: No.

LAX Room 2: I can't lecture on everything, so my notes will have minority, majority, but minority jurisdictions do say that you can

LAX Room 2: You okay?

LAX Room 2: There is a, subsection of actual occupancy.

LAX Room 2: And it's cold.

LAX Room 2: constructive possession. There's actual possession, and now there is constructive possession.

LAX Room 2: Okay? Let's not…

LAX Room 2: I will get emails and phone calls up until the hour before the final exam about. Instructive possession, okay?

LAX Room 2: It's not hard.

LAX Room 2: All you have to do is just keep it very simple. Just keep it simple, okay?

LAX Room 2: Let's just keep it simple.

LAX Room 2: Right?

LAX Room 2: What I said for actual occupancy is this. You can only claim with what you are actually using, right?

LAX Room 2: Right? Yes.

LAX Room 2: So if I'm using the outhouse.

LAX Room 2: What can I play? Right. You guys are good. Now… How?

LAX Room 2: can I claim?

LAX Room 2: All of the problems.

LAX Room 2: But I want it all.

LAX Room 2: Start scattering things everywhere? They can do that.

LAX Room 2: There is a way of constructively occupying all of the property.

LAX Room 2: If two scenarios… or, two things are satisfied.

LAX Room 2: One, someone is taking under the color of title.

LAX Room 2: Which is, often through some type of defective deep.

LAX Room 2: So, it's some type of instrument. One, Some type of instrument, Purporting to convey

LAX Room 2: All the land to you. I'm conveying to you all of Blackacre. Here's a deed.

LAX Room 2: Except it's defective, it doesn't work, it's fraudulent, who knows what, okay? It's ineffective.

LAX Room 2: But it's some type of instrument purporting to give you

LAX Room 2: everything, okay? You with me so far? So that's one requirement.

LAX Room 2: The second part is… The adverse possessor must occupy Some part of the land.

LAX Room 2: some art.

LAX Room 2: What happens if it's only a yard? That's fine, that's some art.

LAX Room 2: So… Taking under… Color and title.

LAX Room 2: Which is some type of instrument purporting to convey title.

LAX Room 2: And two, plus two, Occupying at least Part of the land.

LAX Room 2: So, I love this house.

LAX Room 2: Where do I look? What's a good neighborhood?

LAX Room 2: Newport.

Fatima Razavi: Flower Streets in Corona del.

LAX Room 2: Who said that? Who said that? Who said that? He did? Good man. You know what's really funny?

LAX Room 2: There was a student a few years ago that, like, showed up in my office a few times. Even the girl in the front, like, hey, this guy's back! He's a really harmless guy, but it's kind of fun.

LAX Room 2: But I… I think it was stock.

LAX Room 2: Anyways… They're like, the guy's back.

LAX Room 2: That's okay. But he used to bring desserts and stuff.

LAX Room 2: The girls like that. Rance.

LAX Room 2: Anyways… Okay, I love this house, it's in Newport Beach.

LAX Room 2: It's in the ghetto part of Newport Beach.

LAX Room 2: I usually save the story till next semester, but …

LAX Room 2: My old girlfriend from high school.

LAX Room 2: High school.

LAX Room 2: I have the most extravagant house I have ever been in in my entire life, and it'd be the most extravagant house anyone in this room has ever been in.

LAX Room 2: There was probably… A billion dollars worth of art in-house.

LAX Room 2: you walk to her bedroom. It's, like, 100 yards, marble, like, paintings, 40 by 40 feet, and 30-foot statues, and you're just like, oh!

LAX Room 2: Jeez.

LAX Room 2: Excellent. Yep, right?

LAX Room 2: Am I right? I married her, right? No, but she actually was really cool. She was very cool. You never, no Chanel, no nothing. She drove a Volkswagen bus from the 70s.

LAX Room 2: Wow, you remember her well. I know. I bought her a… she was cold one night, so I bought her this sweatshirt at CVS for, like, 10 bucks. She wore that thing for, like, 2 months. Wore flip-flops, and that's it. And her dad was the richest man in Newport Beach.

LAX Room 2: Nothing, got nothing. Dad drove an Expedition, Mom drove a Volvo.

LAX Room 2: No fancy things, except the damn house. Ha! I'll never forget that house. Billion.

LAX Room 2: Priceless things.

LAX Room 2: I met her father, he's in Cabo City.

LAX Room 2: He's, like, this total hippie guy that dropped out of school in the 9th grade.

LAX Room 2: self-made.

LAX Room 2: multi-billionaire. … It's like, have a seat?

LAX Room 2: You like the chair? I was like, yeah, it's cool, it's like 18. Yeah, yeah, it's a good chair. It's Napoleon's chair. I know who that was, and I was like, oh, fuck.

LAX Room 2: I know.

LAX Room 2: Anyways, that's the house. I would love to adversely deduce that house. God, I would love to do that.

LAX Room 2: Oh, when I first went in, I was like, wow, you got a really nice house. And she's like, huh?

LAX Room 2: I was saying, this is a pool house. I'm like, this is a pool house? She got an indoor swimming pool in the pool house? It's a 5-bedroom, like, home.

LAX Room 2: There's an indoor swimming pool in this 5-bedroom home. The house is on way over there.

LAX Room 2: Should've married a car. Yep. Yep. Screwed that one up.

LAX Room 2: Anyways, going back to what's relatively… So…

LAX Room 2: You want to own a whole… this nice home in Newport Beach, So, you get a D.

LAX Room 2: purporting to convey title. Maybe you're frauded. You're frauded out of it. Someone's frauding you. But nonetheless, you have an instrument that is giving you title, right?

LAX Room 2: And you love this house, oh! And so you… only use this part.

LAX Room 2: Oh, what about all this part? No, only this part, okay?

LAX Room 2: That is sufficient to meet constructive possession of all of the problems.

LAX Room 2: Which means that if I claim adverse possession, I can claim

LAX Room 2: Oh, the property, even though I only use this.

LAX Room 2: Make sense? I am constructively possessing all of the property through this defective deed and using some of the property.

LAX Room 2: If I don't have constructive possession, if I don't have it.

LAX Room 2: then I can only claim that of what I'm actually occupying, which is this.

LAX Room 2: Don't complicate it, okay?

LAX Room 2: You said it's only a minority of jurisdictions that have this? I never said that, but minority jurisdictions require to satisfy, adverse possession, you can only satisfy through constructive possession.

LAX Room 2: Right.

LAX Room 2: I believe that's in my notes. It's probably highlighted in red.

LAX Room 2: Is it in red? It's gotta be in red, because it says minority.

LAX Room 2: Don't understandable.

LAX Room 2: Well, fraudulent.

LAX Room 2: I'll kidding.

LAX Room 2: The piece of paper?

LAX Room 2: He's gotta, you know, you don't need… hold on.

LAX Room 2: You got a piece of paper right here.

LAX Room 2: What does that say?

LAX Room 2: No, I'm a fraudster.

LAX Room 2: I don't own this property.

LAX Room 2: I live in Redondo Beach in a van.

LAX Room 2: But I'm selling you this house in Newport Beach.

LAX Room 2: So… Here is an instrument that I put together.

LAX Room 2: And I'm giving it to you.

LAX Room 2: In it, this deed, to the home, purports…

LAX Room 2: to convey this Newport Beach home, to you.

LAX Room 2: But it's ineffective, it's fraudulent, I'm going to prison, whatever it is.

LAX Room 2: So, it purports To give a title.

LAX Room 2: If you go onto that Newport Beach property.

LAX Room 2: And you use at least some of the lamp, right here.

LAX Room 2: You can claim ownership of the entire parcel.

LAX Room 2: Okay.

LAX Room 2: But if this never happens.

LAX Room 2: And you just went on the land, because you either don't like me, or innocent, doesn't matter.

LAX Room 2: You can only claim that of what you actually use.

LAX Room 2: Bye.

LAX Room 2: Thank you.

LAX Room 2: Usually in a good mood on, Thursdays, because I don't have… I don't normally have port on Fridays, but I have port tomorrow. I'm in a bad mood. I gotta be downtown.

LAX Room 2: In, like, 12 hours. Anyways… …

LAX Room 2: Questions on actual occupancy and the sub-issue of construction.

LAX Room 2: Sorry to go back a little, but this is property…

LAX Room 2: that's not claimed, or that does have an owner. I'm confused on that part of it. This is unclaimed or claimed property?

LAX Room 2: What do you mean?

LAX Room 2: For example, that… land, right there. This land, right here.

LAX Room 2: Yes.

LAX Room 2: Is that… claimed? Like, it's somebody's land, or it's nobody's?

LAX Room 2: Let me ask you this.

LAX Room 2: What was the first 5 minutes of me lecturing about?

LAX Room 2: actual… John?

LAX Room 2: Of, like, when I first started seeing adverse possession.

LAX Room 2: What's the whole rationale behind it?

LAX Room 2: Punishing the owner. Oh, punishing the owner. Yes, yes, you're right. So, there has to be a trespass.

LAX Room 2: If no one owns the property, You're not a trespasser.

LAX Room 2: Oh, yeah.

LAX Room 2: Martials.

LAX Room 2: 3 more minutes.

LAX Room 2: The adverse possessor, or the trespasser, the person, entity, or individual, or entities who are claiming adverse possession must show that their or individual occupancy was open and notorious.

LAX Room 2: Those are just long words, or one is a long word, kind of.

LAX Room 2: The other one's only… it's pretty short. That is, in other words, telling you, or asking you to discuss if the trespasser's occupancy was visible.

LAX Room 2: Would a reasonable inspection of this property reveal some form of adverse occupancy?

LAX Room 2: Now… It's a reasonable inspection.

LAX Room 2: So I could just put a, you know, a bandana over my eyes and say, I didn't know!

LAX Room 2: It's reasonable.

LAX Room 2: So if you're, you know, entertaining some type of deliberate ignorance or willful blindness of something.

LAX Room 2: The law will never favor that, okay? So it's reasonable inspection.

LAX Room 2: So look to see if the adverse possessor, if their activity was visible by a reasonable inspection.

LAX Room 2: Is it underground?

LAX Room 2: Wow, I really like this house.

LAX Room 2: And I need to do an inspection, so I need to dig a hole about 8 feet.

LAX Room 2: Really, do an inspection.

LAX Room 2: An 8-foot hole, right in the middle of the living room.

LAX Room 2: Okay.

LAX Room 2: It's a reasonable reasonable, not… Absolute, like, it's just what's reasonable, okay?

LAX Room 2: So, if someone is… owns a 2-acre parcel, and

LAX Room 2: 20 by 20 feet, there's these marijuana plants everywhere.

LAX Room 2: If you're not growing marijuana, you're gonna probably notice that?

LAX Room 2: Reasonable inspection?

LAX Room 2: I'll take a break.

LAX Room 2: 15 minutes.

Dove night: Can I ask a question?

Dove night: Ask the question, so open and notorious as occupancy is visible by reasonable inspection.

LAX Room 2: Yeah.

LAX Room 2: Is the trespasser's occupancy noticeable?

Dove night: Oh, noticeable.

LAX Room 2: The grocery store? Yeah.

LAX Room 2: Let's go by a reasonable inspection. Thank you.

LAX Room 2: I think so. I think so.

LAX Room 2: But no, it's nice, it's really modern. Exactly.

LAX Room 2: They were on the freeway. Criminals, like… I don't know.

LAX Room 2: I asked the same thing. But I took summer school at that one time.

LAX Room 2: I guess we'll get started again. I didn't know that.

LAX Room 2: It's not like there's no quiz.

LAX Room 2: Yeah, yes, I know. Really crazy. Alright, so we're starting to identify the minimum force.

LAX Room 2: Any questions from what we have covered so far?

LAX Room 2: By the way, … I'm just kidding. There was a discussion during,

LAX Room 2: part of the break about never returning here again. Ever. Ever. Ever again. And I wanted to know…

LAX Room 2: Who, if any of you, would like to return here again.

LAX Room 2: This is a lot.

LAX Room 2: I know there's someone. I know there's some. Okay, look, if you don't want to say anything now, it's okay, just send me a text, or shoot me an email.

LAX Room 2: And I will delete it.

LAX Room 2: But I hope to never come back here again. Never again.

LAX Room 2: So, I think for the people that are attending in the Matrix, I think they might be happy about that, right?

Andre Hakobyan: Nope. Matter of fact, I want to join you guys.

Andre Hakobyan: And I hope this won't affect my final grade.

LAX Room 2: What? I didn't even hear that. I hope this won't affect his final grade. He wants to come to class.

LAX Room 2: wants to come to class. I want to come to class, but, you know, the time I'm supposed to be here, I'm not here! That's a fair point. I think you just waived any ability to have any right to come here now.

LAX Room 2: Oh, I'm gonna hate him now. There's a colleague of mine watching.

LAX Room 2: Goodbye.

LAX Room 2: enrollment classes.

LAX Room 2: Thumbs up! Yes, it's fun time, it's play time! We're having fun! This is your vacation, remember? It is my vacation. Is your hand raised? Thumbs up. Oh, thumbs up, okay. Yay!

LAX Room 2: This, Professor Marjanian, is anyone taking care of her torts? Yeah. Is she physically in the real world? No matrix for her. And there's only, like, 3 people in the class. Four. Four. Oh my god.

LAX Room 2: It's a lot hotter, like, I think so many people want to show up in person, that's why I can't blame those.

LAX Room 2: I'm in the AI. Yeah, I am the Matrix.

LAX Room 2: Well, if you don't tell Professor Morganian, I would like to never come back here ever again, because I think, I mean, I consider her my boss.

LAX Room 2: Oh, she's our superior? Okay. I don't know, I think she is. I mean, if… if Professor Marjanian asked me to do something, I'd do it, but if Professor Sebastian asked me, I'd say, get lost, dude. You know what I mean?

LAX Room 2: Professor Sebastian and I are friends, so we talk all the time.

LAX Room 2: bag on him all the time. You guys will have that, too. Like, you guys will have that buddy-buddy system, too. It's amazing, and you guys go to court, you guys, like, refer cases together. This is why I love our school, because, like.

LAX Room 2: Oh, we've been, I don't know… I only see you, I only see you once a year. You only get to see me once a year, whenever the school asks me to come in person, or at graduation. Or at graduation. Yeah, we sit next to each other. Yeah. And ask if we have snacks. The people here have no idea what is happening right now. Oh!

LAX Room 2: Here, I have no idea, they're just like… Do they say hi, and like, I'm disrupting class.

LAX Room 2: By the way, this is Professor Dow, she wrote a textbook recently on ethics. In the library, you can actually go get it right now. A signed textbook on ethics. It took you 2 years to write that? During the pandemic, while, yeah, on lockdown. Reduce the time. Yeah. It would increase the tuition. It's not fun.

LAX Room 2: The next book might be immigration, I'm still thinking about it. But it was good seeing you guys, good luck! Enjoy class! Good to see you guys in the real world. Once a year! Anyways, any questions? Any questions?

Amir Akbari: I have a question.

LAX Room 2: I'm sure the first one was already in the comments.

Amir Akbari: I have a question.

LAX Room 2: Stu has a question?

Amir Akbari: I have a question.

LAX Room 2: Okay, so what's your question?

Amir Akbari: For college.

LAX Room 2: moderate.

Amir Akbari: taught.

Amir Akbari: for color.

LAX Room 2: Louder.

Amir Akbari: Right?

Amir Akbari: For color of title, what is the requirement for the person who claimed that?

LAX Room 2: Louder, louder. Scream it! Put your mouth next to the microphone, and scream it so we can all hear you.

Amir Akbari: Okay.

Amir Akbari: For color of title, what is the requirement for the person who claims that?

Amir Akbari: Does he need to have a knowledge of that?

LAX Room 2: The requirement is the adverse possessor accepted a defective deed purporting to convey title of the entire parcel, all of Blackacre. And…

LAX Room 2: the adverse possessor used some of the property.

LAX Room 2: That's it. And they can claim possession, constructive possession, of all.

LAX Room 2: the property.

Amir Akbari: So they, they don't, they didn't have a knowledge of the, like, Forge did, right?

LAX Room 2: low. Can't you put the volume up? Yeah, there has to be low.

LAX Room 2: Oops.

LAX Room 2: I believe it's… Brian.

Amir Akbari: They didn't have a knowledge of the forged deed, right?

LAX Room 2: Okay?

Amir Akbari: Okay, that's.

LAX Room 2: I mean, it doesn't matter if they did or didn't?

Amir Akbari: It doesn't….

LAX Room 2: Is this a deed purporting to convey title?

LAX Room 2: That's the extent of what I'm teaching you.

Amir Akbari: Pink.

LAX Room 2: Anything else?

Dove night: So if they don't have constructive possession, they can just go on the property and claim… they only can claim only a part of the property they're on?

LAX Room 2: if they're claiming constructive possessions, they could claim possession of the entire parcel, despite only using part of the land. Yes? Did anybody leave their tickets in the…

LAX Room 2: Staff launch?

LAX Room 2: instant.

LAX Room 2: Of my own.

LAX Room 2: So if any of you guys has lost it or left it there, come to the library. Melted my heart. Melted my heart. Melted my heart.

LAX Room 2: Driving home happy.

LAX Room 2: So we're done. Okay, so, did you… did I answer your question, sir?

Dove night: Yes, about constructive property, adverse, if they don't have a color or title, they only can claim one part of the property, right?

LAX Room 2: What'd you say?

Dove night: They only can claim one part of the property if they don't have the deed or title.

LAX Room 2: All I can say is that they just have to…

LAX Room 2: occupy some of the product. They don't have to occupy all the property.

Dove night: Okay, thank you.

LAX Room 2: So, if you have actual… you also have constructive possession, can you, like, is it both? So, like, you have one or the other, or it's both? You have to occupy, actually occupy part of the property, at least for constructive possession.

LAX Room 2: But if you don't have constructive possession.

LAX Room 2: Like, you just find land and start using it.

LAX Room 2: only claim that which you actually use. Okay.

LAX Room 2: Thank you.

LAX Room 2: For open and notorious, is the adverse possessor's activity Visible upon a reasonable inspection.

LAX Room 2: so ignorance of, oh, I just never checked this land because I live in Tokyo, and the land is in…

LAX Room 2: Arkansas?

LAX Room 2: How did you know? Did you go through this last week?

LAX Room 2: That's, like, one of those states, like, that…

LAX Room 2: I don't even like to fly over. Damn. Damn.

LAX Room 2: All the notes.

LAX Room 2: Tomorrow, I aren't.

LAX Room 2: Look, I had to go to some of those states.

LAX Room 2: Some waxes. Oh, those are mine. Thank you.

LAX Room 2: Thank you.

LAX Room 2: So… Anywhere else other than Arkansas, Nebraska, but… So, …

LAX Room 2: It doesn't matter if I live in Tokyo, and I've never seen the land, I just don't go there, because it's a reasonable inspection.

LAX Room 2: Okay, it's not… I personally didn't see it, what a reasonable inspection review.

LAX Room 2: the ad person.

LAX Room 2: Okay? I don't care if you're the greatest person in the world, I don't care if you have the Medal of Honor.

LAX Room 2: People like you.

LAX Room 2: cured cancer. I don't care what you did.

LAX Room 2: Don't lose your property. Reasonable inspection.

LAX Room 2: Questions?

LAX Room 2: You must establish actual, if applicable, constructive possession. You must establish open auditoriums. Any other questions on what we have covered so far?

LAX Room 2: The next requirement that you must establish is hostile.

LAX Room 2: Don't read into it more. All hostile means is, did you have the adverse possessor, did you, the adverse possessor, have the true owner's permission

LAX Room 2: If it's permissive, then the person's not a trespasser, Doctor's fine.

LAX Room 2: No.

LAX Room 2: No, I had first possession.

LAX Room 2: Is the person a trespasser? And hostile…

LAX Room 2: Is the element that establishes that.

LAX Room 2: Because if it's permissive, they're not a trespasser. Yes, you could live on this land, you could do whatever you want on this land.

LAX Room 2: Blah, blah, blah.

LAX Room 2: Hostile just means the true owner, the true rightful owner of his property.

LAX Room 2: Did you have permission from it?

LAX Room 2: Now, there are some jurisdictions that differ in regards to hostile.

LAX Room 2: And… Some of them take the approach That, like, minority.

LAX Room 2: Minority jurisdictions require that The adverse possessor, the trespasser, have this good faith belief.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: Because it doesn't want to act like it's rewarding an ill-willed trespasser.

LAX Room 2: So they… those minority states or jurisdictions require that the adverse possessor have a good faith belief that they are the rightful owner. So maybe they found property, or they…

LAX Room 2: They discovered this property they thought was abandoned. Maybe they took from an illegitimate deed from a fraudster, for example.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: … So you want to look for facts like that to establish that good faith belief.

LAX Room 2: What?

LAX Room 2: majority jurisdictions, the majority, which is, I believe, in… highlighted in blue, or teal, …

LAX Room 2: The state of mind of the trespasser, the state of mind of the adverse possessor, is not a relevant factor. So they… the adverse possessor could

LAX Room 2: I want to invade your land, I want to take your land from you, or…

LAX Room 2: I thought this was my land, I'm so sorry! The state of mind of the adverse possessor is not a relevant factor for consideration.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: So the majority of you is, who cares?

LAX Room 2: The minority view is… Does the adverse possessor have that good faith beliefs? Okay?

LAX Room 2: Like, I could accidentally build a swimming pool that encroaches on your property and not know it. Say, I'm so sorry, I thought that was my property.

LAX Room 2: app.

Dove night: So the hostel is… did the adverse possession have the owner's permission?

LAX Room 2: Yeah.

LAX Room 2: I think that's what I said, right?

LAX Room 2: They're better.

LAX Room 2: Okay.

LAX Room 2: Questions on hostile?

LAX Room 2: Nope.

LAX Room 2: What do you say, hey, this is easy?

LAX Room 2: Remember that… hostile… Can get tricky sometimes.

LAX Room 2: For example.

LAX Room 2: Yeah, John, you could… Use my backyard anytime you want.

LAX Room 2: But I start hosting, Billy Idol concerts every weekend. Thousands of people.

LAX Room 2: Who's that?

LAX Room 2: Really? I don't… Oh, God.

LAX Room 2: Is anyone born after 9-11? Who was born after 9-11?

LAX Room 2: who was born after 9-11? Please tell me. Who is… who are you? I know you're… I know you're around.

LAX Room 2: We end up somewhere. Oh, there you go.

LAX Room 2: God! It's like, what? It's like 5 years ago! That's crazy.

LAX Room 2: Okay, so in school, in school, we learned about 9-11 because we weren't alive at the time, and we learned how many… let me ask you, for the people that weren't born on 9-11, how many towers, how many buildings fell down in New York City on 9-11?

LAX Room 2: No.

LAX Room 2: How many buildings… how many buildings fell down in New York City on 9-11?

LAX Room 2: Who's talking that was born before 9-11?

LAX Room 2: Did you learn at school? Huh? What'd you learn at school? I didn't learn in school. You didn't learn about 9-11 in school?

LAX Room 2: How many buildings fell down? Anyone know? Is it 3? 3. You said two? You said two, you're just so gone. No idea. Look it up. Three buildings. One just fell down!

LAX Room 2: It just fell! Anyways, going back. I want to host Billy Idol.

LAX Room 2: Rockstar from the 80s.

LAX Room 2: Billy Idol concerts, okay? But… When you gave me permission to use the backyard.

LAX Room 2: Did you give me… was it a con… was it contemplated that I would use the backyard for sandwiches for thousands of people to work on them? No, no.

LAX Room 2: Yeah, but you're my go-to. So that presents a little bit of an issue here.

LAX Room 2: It's a problem.

LAX Room 2: What was the scope of consent exactly? What was understood? Was it permissive?

LAX Room 2: Does simply giving you permission to use my backyard give you unfettered discretion to host thousands of people on a magnificence?

LAX Room 2: Probably, no.

LAX Room 2: So in that case, it would likely be deemed hostile.

LAX Room 2: Despite there being permission.

LAX Room 2: Right?

LAX Room 2: It's just like the plumber. Yes, come on in!

LAX Room 2: Can't go through the underwear drawer, right?

LAX Room 2: Dan the plumber?

LAX Room 2: No. To know, right?

LAX Room 2: No?

LAX Room 2: A little bit? No? Not even, not even… no? So, wait a sec, what, you gave him permission?

LAX Room 2: Gotta be him, sorry, yeah, it could be her.

LAX Room 2: Could be hurt, right?

LAX Room 2: Yes, right, it could be a her.

LAX Room 2: Yes.

LAX Room 2: Oh, well, in that case, hmm, interesting. No, but… so, just by giving someone permission does not mean you give them this unfettered discretion to do whatever they please.

LAX Room 2: So you have to look at what was contemplated exactly, okay?

LAX Room 2: Questions?

LAX Room 2: Exclusivity. Exclusive. Exclusivity.

LAX Room 2: to… This, in other words, is just saying, is the true owner Sharing.

LAX Room 2: the property.

LAX Room 2: With the adverse concession.

LAX Room 2: It cannot be… share.

LAX Room 2: Cheer.

LAX Room 2: It's kind of weird… That someone's a trespasser, if you're the true owner.

LAX Room 2: We both are using the land.

LAX Room 2: Right?

LAX Room 2: Kind of presents an issue, right?

LAX Room 2: So, there's a requirement that in order for the adverse possessor to succeed in this type of action.

LAX Room 2: They have to prove that the property wasn't shared.

LAX Room 2: Now, that doesn't necessarily mean that…

LAX Room 2: If it means that this section of what I'm actually using was not shared.

LAX Room 2: Okay? Because I can obviously adversely possess this property.

LAX Room 2: And the person could just kind of live in a Romanian-type-style winter house.

LAX Room 2: … On the other corner.

LAX Room 2: Speaking of Romania, I didn't go on vacation this summer, so I'm really mad.

LAX Room 2: We're planning on leaving the country, maybe, like, next month, to Romania.

LAX Room 2: The most typical response is, why would you go to Romain? Not me.

LAX Room 2: What's that? Pennsylvania, yeah.

LAX Room 2: Check out the vampires.

LAX Room 2: Anyways, no, …

LAX Room 2: So, I don't know if I'm gonna go on vacation, but if I do, I will either teach from

LAX Room 2: wherever that may be, or I might have, … Professor Goldwashing cover for me.

LAX Room 2: … Questions on exclusivity?

LAX Room 2: Terrible.

LAX Room 2: … I'm not sure if I typically talk about property tax here or not.

LAX Room 2: But it's very quick minority jurisdictions, like in California.

LAX Room 2: Require that the adverse possessor pay property tax.

LAX Room 2: Because they kind of follow, California and minority jurisdictions follow that good faith.

LAX Room 2: That… if you really held that good faith, you're gonna pay property taxes on the adverse… on this land that you're trespassing on.

LAX Room 2: So, absent that, if you're not paying taxes, you can't succeed to an adverse possession claim.

LAX Room 2: … But the next requirement is CONTINUS.

LAX Room 2: I've gotten real cute on this.

LAX Room 2: Believe me.

LAX Room 2: Continuance.

LAX Room 2: So, look and examine.

LAX Room 2: the occupants.

LAX Room 2: Is the occupancy.

LAX Room 2: interrupted? Is it constant? Is it interrupted? Did the adverse possessor Abandon it?

LAX Room 2: Were they only there temporarily, and then took off?

LAX Room 2: So if I…

LAX Room 2: find a piece of land that I think is abandoned, and I build a home, a house, okay?

LAX Room 2: That house will be a constant occupation.

LAX Room 2: Unless I make it very clear that I'm abandoning this.

LAX Room 2: I'm moving to Romania forever, okay?

LAX Room 2: I'm out, I'm gone, I'm in Romania, I'm in Bucharest, Romania. And then I realized how damn cold it is, so then I said, I'm gonna move back.

LAX Room 2: That time span that I left Would likely be an interruption

LAX Room 2: And would not satisfy the continuous occupancy requirements.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: So, look for interruption.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: I believe maybe 2, 3 years ago, I wrote on a final exam where I said the person moved out of the country for 9 months.

LAX Room 2: Or was out of the country for 9 months.

LAX Room 2: And I got, like, absolute law review articles about, oh no, that's awful, this person needs to die, they'll never be able to claim that for his possession. But then I just wrote, can't go on vacation?

LAX Room 2: Right?

LAX Room 2: Can't go on vacation? It doesn't say that they moved, it just says they left.

LAX Room 2: For overseas, or something like that.

LAX Room 2: Can't, like, go on vacation.

LAX Room 2: It's not vacationed for 9 months, right?

LAX Room 2: Yes.

LAX Room 2: You can go on vacation for 9 months, right?

LAX Room 2: Yo? Yeah.

LAX Room 2: budget. Not ideal. Some people, like, live their life on vacation. I don't know how to make this. Every day's a vacation.

LAX Room 2: Right?

LAX Room 2: Some of us have to go to court every day.

LAX Room 2: So, you have to look for, or you should look for, interruption. This could be a major issue, it could be a minor one.

LAX Room 2: But just look to see if there's any interruption.

LAX Room 2: And when we go through practice essay questions, I will absolutely destroy you on this, because I will catch everyone in this class on this. So just be very careful.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: Most students, when they go through this, are like, oh, yeah, this is easy, this is this, this, this, this.

LAX Room 2: But you miss a lot of stuff.

LAX Room 2: And, … It's not about just, like, getting the issue.

LAX Room 2: It's… there's gonna be a lot of things to discuss.

LAX Room 2: And I usually get… not what I'm looking for.

LAX Room 2: It's because they get overly confident.

LAX Room 2: Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

LAX Room 2: Don't worry, I will, … Prepare you for that.

LAX Room 2: I don't think it's hard, I just think that…

LAX Room 2: I don't really know what's going on in your brain, but… I'll carry before.

LAX Room 2: You're all wrong. Keep it away?

LAX Room 2: The long run.

LAX Room 2: However, you would like.

LAX Room 2: Money.

LAX Room 2: Excuse me.

LAX Room 2: … Look for any interruption.

LAX Room 2: Last… But certainly not… the least.

LAX Room 2: is term abuse.

LAX Room 2: Now, other supplemental sources will call it other stuff.

LAX Room 2: Some will say continuous for a term of yours, that's fine, it's no problem.

LAX Room 2: I just separate them because I'm very mechanical.

LAX Room 2: I think very mechanically, I like to break things down.

LAX Room 2: And, I think I have really bad OCD.

LAX Room 2: not where, like, I have to clean things, but I can't stand People making things more complicated.

LAX Room 2: Than they need to.

LAX Room 2: And it happens all the time.

LAX Room 2: I feel like I have to solve it better. So hopefully when I'm teaching, I try to teach in a way that just makes it so much…

LAX Room 2: more simpler than it is. If I'm still complicated, not understanding, it's calm, okay? I promise you, I won't yell at you like I do here. Actually, I'll probably be pretty nice. Alright.

LAX Room 2: … But, …

LAX Room 2: So you can combine continuous and term of years together. I separate them, I think it's better.

LAX Room 2: So, it should be here, but we're gonna move it all the way up here.

Dove night: Hold up here.

LAX Room 2: Term of yours. I was like, Amanda, …

LAX Room 2: The beauty of Term of Years is…

LAX Room 2: Modernly, modern law requires there to be some type of statutory period.

LAX Room 2: Three years.

LAX Room 2: It's 5 years.

LAX Room 2: 10 years, 15, 20, 30?

LAX Room 2: So, there must be some type of statute that states…

LAX Room 2: The statute of limitations period for trespass.

LAX Room 2: It must be there, because you have to determine if the adverse possessor, established that period.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: So, the fact pattern, your final exam.

LAX Room 2: Sometimes it's a dead giveaway, because it says this jurisdiction has a statute of limitations period for trespass of 5 years. Oh, okay, then you know.

LAX Room 2: That the adverse possessor Must satisfy all of these requirements.

LAX Room 2: For a total of… 5 years.

LAX Room 2: I usually make it easy 10 years.

LAX Room 2: … So then you know the adverse possessor must adversely possess this property for… 10 years.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: If it's the common law days, which are, like, pre… I mean, before the iPhone.

LAX Room 2: Of course, some of you are even born?

LAX Room 2: Common law is… it's automatically 20 years. Common law is 20 years.

LAX Room 2: So I won't normally be very nice to you, and I'm just gonna have a fact pattern that has no statute, so you don't even know. Doesn't say anything. Doesn't say it anywhere.

LAX Room 2: Oh my god, we can't answer this!

LAX Room 2: I got 36 hours to do my vinyl, I can't do this.

LAX Room 2: … So, I won't usually give you one.

LAX Room 2: So… Do the best you can.

LAX Room 2: You can't necessarily accurately conclude that someone has fulfilled that statutory period unless you actually know the statutory period, right?

LAX Room 2: So some students get creative, they say it defaults to common law, totally fine, you can do that. You can write whatever you want.

LAX Room 2: I don't really see a lot of points in it, if that's the case.

LAX Room 2: So, when you are going through this discussion here.

LAX Room 2: Okay? If anything's clear to you, for obvious.

LAX Room 2: What does that tell you?

LAX Room 2: It's not being cut.

LAX Room 2: What?

LAX Room 2: I mean… Berror, right?

LAX Room 2: There's no points. There's never points in the obvious! This is clearly this. Oh, I didn't know. Okay, it's clear, that's great. There's no points in it, then.

LAX Room 2: It's what's not obvious, what's not precise, what's not… what's wacky.

LAX Room 2: That's the beauty.

LAX Room 2: So, for…

LAX Room 2: When… back in the golden days, when people took real final exams.

LAX Room 2: it was much easier, because I was able to kind of…

LAX Room 2: Throw certain things in a final exam.

LAX Room 2: Where if a student under the gun, they have one hour, and they're doing the best they can, could pick up.

LAX Room 2: I know they're thinking. It's a little bit harder now when they have 36 hours, you don't understand, it's so hard. Like, oh, you don't know. It's a little bit harder to grade, because

LAX Room 2: Your final exam will be written to be done in 1 hour. You just have times 36 more hours.

LAX Room 2: So it's a little hard to break.

LAX Room 2: And… throw the things I typically used to do.

LAX Room 2: So, … But we'll go over them.

LAX Room 2: Term of yours.

LAX Room 2: Let's fulfill that statutory period, okay?

LAX Room 2: So… Can someone volunteer? Any volunteers?

LAX Room 2: Okay.

LAX Room 2: So… Okay. Adverse possessor went into possession in 2015.

LAX Room 2: It is… It is 2025!

LAX Room 2: Statute of limitations period is 10 years.

LAX Room 2: Did the adverse possessor fulfill the statutory degree? Yes.

LAX Room 2: There you go.

LAX Room 2: Spencer.

LAX Room 2: So… Client comes to you and says, I need to help me.

LAX Room 2: Some a-hole is on my property.

LAX Room 2: Says he's been there since 2015.

LAX Room 2: Are you supposed to say, since 2015, it's 2025?

LAX Room 2: Sorry, get out, I can't help you. Bye! Depends on the month. There you go.

LAX Room 2: I wouldn't go as far as hour, but I would go as far as month and day.

LAX Room 2: It's like… you know.

LAX Room 2: If you work for one of those PI attorneys, call your PI. Oh, so do they? So do they? EVERYONE does PI!

LAX Room 2: Everybody knows PI. Every time I meet a new PI attorney, I'm like, oh, nice to meet you.

LAX Room 2: I have no idea, like, I've never met a PI attorney before. They all are! I'll get you referral fees. Well, you know, we'll say, you know, …

LAX Room 2: They all do that.

LAX Room 2: I went off on my evidence class last night about that.

LAX Room 2: I'm not bagging on them, but it's just so many. It's such a saturated market, right? Everyone's a PI attorney.

LAX Room 2: Except me.

LAX Room 2: I'm the best. I'm not one.

LAX Room 2: No, there's a lot of criminal attorneys, too.

LAX Room 2: But it just seems that that… the PI market is so saturated.

LAX Room 2: So just advice for you that really are going into that field. You're going to be ent… Who's that?

LAX Room 2: Just not gonna go correctly.

LAX Room 2: How many mutations can I do think?

LAX Room 2: Melting my heart.

LAX Room 2: But if you're actually gonna go in that field, you have to remember something, that

LAX Room 2: years ago, 30, 40, 50 years ago, there'd be attorneys that do family law, I'd do bankruptcy, I do psychic readings, I mean, everything, okay?

LAX Room 2: Nowadays.

LAX Room 2: If an attorney says I do civil and criminal, I would never in a million years ever hire that person. I do immigration and this. I would never hire that person.

LAX Room 2: You could in the olden days, but the law is very specific now.

LAX Room 2: So, if you are injured, you want to just get a personal injury attorney. I don't know anything else other than personal injury, right?

LAX Room 2: You get arrested for a crime, I want to hire someone that just does the law.

LAX Room 2: I need a new heart. I don't need a foot and heart doctor, right?

LAX Room 2: But, as we go further and further and further.

LAX Room 2: you're gonna have to get even more specific. I do PI cases against the LA Unified School District when it comes to bus accidents.

LAX Room 2: I'm a specialist at that.

LAX Room 2: Okay.

LAX Room 2: So just remember, it's gonna be even more specific, okay? Even for what I do.

LAX Room 2: There's DUI attorneys. I don't even do DUI cases.

LAX Room 2: I turn them down. …

LAX Room 2: But, I have a kind of a little bit of a niche practice, so I do federal crimes, and a lot of referrals that I get are from criminal defense attorneys, because there's not a lot of competition.

LAX Room 2: So I've kind of attacked that mark.

LAX Room 2: But, even then, you kind of have to get a little bit more, …

LAX Room 2: More niche with that, too.

LAX Room 2: Anyone do… work for a criminal attorney or anything?

LAX Room 2: Nope.

LAX Room 2: Nope?

LAX Room 2: Nope.

LAX Room 2: It's terrible.

LAX Room 2: Always.

LAX Room 2: Some of my students are DAs, some are public defenders, and I just absolutely go wild seeing them in court. Wild, it's absolutely mind-boggling.

LAX Room 2: Weird, but cool.

LAX Room 2: Because they'll be in a courtroom, I'll say, hey, how's this judge? Do they do this, this, this, this? And they're training me.

LAX Room 2: Because at this point, I have students that are, like, public defenders, DAs of 10 years.

LAX Room 2: Okay.

LAX Room 2: Probably 10 years ago. Anyways… This is the part, … So, as far as term…

LAX Room 2: there are certain exceptions, that's the FCC contracts do.

LAX Room 2: But I wouldn't lie to people. This is the one… let's see this… Part of the class.

LAX Room 2: That, that one student… Had a very difficult time.

LAX Room 2: most brilliant student I've ever taught in my existence. By far.

LAX Room 2: could not.

LAX Room 2: understands. And I remember he had to draw it on the board.

LAX Room 2: And it's not that bad, it's just his brain wasn't wired for it.

LAX Room 2: Everything but that.

LAX Room 2: So, can I get rid of this?

LAX Room 2: Oh.

LAX Room 2: Above the trash can? No, I want to get, like, a new board. Trash can?

LAX Room 2: Oh, look at this law class! So, it's a disability. It's called disability.

LAX Room 2: Under the term of years.

LAX Room 2: A sub-issue that does not always come up.

LAX Room 2: But it can. It is called a disability.

LAX Room 2: I think that… The true owner.

LAX Room 2: The true owner of the property.

LAX Room 2: Not the adverse possessor.

LAX Room 2: The owner of the property, the true owner of the property.

LAX Room 2: If they fall within one of these three categories, Then, the clock.

LAX Room 2: The adverse possession, ticking period, the term of years.

LAX Room 2: is paused.

LAX Room 2: Post.

Dove night: Can you repeat that?

LAX Room 2: If one of the following disabilities that I'm going to be talking about in 45 seconds exists!

LAX Room 2: At the time the adverse possessor went into possession, then the clock does not run against the true owner, it's pause.

Dove night: Okay, thank you.

LAX Room 2: If the true owner of the parcel is a minor.

LAX Room 2: At the time, the adverse possessor went into occupancy, remember, at the time.

LAX Room 2: Then, the… Ticking period, the term of years period, let's say it's 10 years in this jurisdiction.

LAX Room 2: It doesn't start to run against the adverse possess… the true owner miner until the miner reaches the age of majority, in which case is 18 years old.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: 18?

LAX Room 2: Buy a shotgun 18, can't buy a pack of cigarettes.

LAX Room 2: Right?

LAX Room 2: It's funny how the states are not alike, so…

LAX Room 2: criminal law, if I… if I… if I have an intimate relationship with a 17-year-old Woman. Girl.

LAX Room 2: I could potentially have to register as a sex offender.

LAX Room 2: I go to Las Vegas, it's okay! 16! And we go to Arkansas, A is minus 14.

LAX Room 2: So, hey, 15, you're all good in Arkansas, no problem, you're not a sex offender, it's what we do here. California, that is disgusting, it's awful, it's, … it's just funny how that kind of works.

LAX Room 2: Sex offender, not. Sex offender, not. By this line.

LAX Room 2: This makes sense, right?

LAX Room 2: That's the ring. But… If the true owner is a minor at the time, Okay?

LAX Room 2: You can say that the clock is paused.

LAX Room 2: until the disability no longer exists. So until they reach the age of majority, until the property is conveyed to someone else, for example. Okay?

LAX Room 2: So if the individual is 17, and they just turned 17,

LAX Room 2: and the adverse possessor then goes into possession, the 10-year period doesn't begin

LAX Room 2: Until the minor reaches the age of 18, which means it's 11 years.

LAX Room 2: From the time of occupancy.

LAX Room 2: Make sense?

LAX Room 2: Say that one more time, I'm sorry. Well, the clock is paused until the miner reaches 18, right? Right.

LAX Room 2: And so, if the miner just turned 17,

LAX Room 2: How long is it until the miner reaches 18? A year. One year. So if this is a 10-year statutory period.

LAX Room 2: That's when it starts.

LAX Room 2: The time the individual turns 18 years old.

LAX Room 2: So technically speaking, it's 11 years.

LAX Room 2: Until there's no longer a disability. Now, it must exist at the time

LAX Room 2: At the time. So if there's no disability at the time of entry, it doesn't matter if a disability arises

LAX Room 2: Any time thereafter, it must be at the time of entry, okay? Lots of hands going on. That was my question. Okay?

LAX Room 2: Nope.

LAX Room 2: Duke enough.

LAX Room 2: I was gonna… if they're insane, and they remain insane, is it indefinite? We're talking about minor! We're talking about minor right here! Well, with the same term… okay, I'll ask later. So, any questions on minors?

LAX Room 2: How can a miner be an owner of land?

LAX Room 2: Technically.

LAX Room 2: You'll get to that when you get to wills, trusts, and estates.

LAX Room 2: Don't care about… It's not the trust, it's not the minor. Sure, it's beyond the scope of this class.

LAX Room 2: incarceration. Is the person incarcerated? Is the adverse possessor, is the true owner incarcerated? Okay?

LAX Room 2: Are they incarcerated?

LAX Room 2: The rationale is they can't object if they're incarcerated.

LAX Room 2: A minor can't object because they're a minor, they lack the capacity. And now, moving ahead to insanity, the rationale is someone who's deemed insane of unsound mind is incapable of

LAX Room 2: Objecting.

LAX Room 2: So now, we'll go…

LAX Room 2: Incarceration, it's a disability until the person is no longer incarcerated, so until, let's say, they're released, or they transfer the property to someone else. That's when the clock starts ticking. Now, insanity.

LAX Room 2: Well, either for insanity or incarceration, if they're incarcerated for life or insane for life, is that paused indefinitely? Definitely. Yeah, and that… For the purposes of this class, yes, but I'm sure in the real world, maybe not.

LAX Room 2: Okay. Because then that goes against the policy of wanting to use the land. Sure.

LAX Room 2: That's just the… It's not something that we'll learn in this class, though.

LAX Room 2: What is insanity?

LAX Room 2: It's not mine.

LAX Room 2: Unsound mind, right?

LAX Room 2: It was an E.

LAX Room 2: Capable of intent.

LAX Room 2: So, I got pretty cute on final exams. I said, this person's suicidal.

LAX Room 2: suicidal.

LAX Room 2: Her brother died, and she just became su… she's, like, suicidal, so she takes medication for her suicide.

LAX Room 2: For suicidal thoughts and all kinds of stuff.

LAX Room 2: Is that insane?

Agnes Gholoonian: Yes.

LAX Room 2: Who said that.

Agnes Gholoonian: I did.

LAX Room 2: Why? I would agree.

Agnes Gholoonian: Because, suicide is something that, if somebody is suicidal, it's…

Agnes Gholoonian: that person can enter a mental facility… or… mental facility? I don't know, like, a psychiatric ward.

LAX Room 2: Well, I mean, I could be suicidal, but, you know, be watching the Super Bowl at home, right? But it's not, like, a reasonable person state of mind. I want to hear what she has to say. Sorry.

Agnes Gholoonian: I agree with that, by the way, that's a great answer.

LAX Room 2: Do you want to hand it off to co-counsel?

Agnes Gholoonian: Yeah, sure. But I just… I think somebody who is, who is suicidal would be considered insane.

Agnes Gholoonian: It's without due respect.

LAX Room 2: Are you saying that someone who is suicidal is tantamount

LAX Room 2: to being insane. So first off, when I think of insane, I think we, like, live in Zelda. Like, you know, this is like, hey, like, I'm playing Mario, this is where I am.

LAX Room 2: But you're saying that someone is suicidal, It's tantamount to that.

Agnes Gholoonian: Yeah.

Agnes Gholoonian: Because that person is not going to make a decision like a person… as a person who's…

Agnes Gholoonian: going to view life in a different way. A person who is suicidal is not going to care about their land, or their property, or what they own.

LAX Room 2: It's not gonna care, but is not caring the same Is not caring akin to not being…

LAX Room 2: Able to understand to object.

Agnes Gholoonian: Well, yeah, because they're… they're not going to be thinking about things like that. They're not….

LAX Room 2: But would you say that they still have the ability to do that?

LAX Room 2: I mean, you know, maybe a parent commits suicide, but, you know, it's calculated, they are a suicidal person, but they leave their estate to their children and all that stuff. They make arrangements that way.

LAX Room 2: So, are you… what I'm trying to get at is, I don't care really what you say.

LAX Room 2: But the rationale for insanity is this person does not have their faculties together.

LAX Room 2: To the point where the law

LAX Room 2: Is gonna deem them incapable of being able to object.

Agnes Gholoonian: Wouldn't….

LAX Room 2: Understand that.

Agnes Gholoonian: Wouldn't one of the… one of the criterias to be suicidal would be, like, depression? So if you're… if you're an extremely depressed person who's having suicidal thought, that person is not going to have that ability to make a rational decision.

LAX Room 2: I mean, I'm depressed right now about 4 months, but I know what you're saying, okay? I totally get it.

LAX Room 2: But… Someone who is depressed and suicidal, are you saying

LAX Room 2: Does not have their faculties together.

LAX Room 2: To the point where they should be.

LAX Room 2: They should be deemed incapable Of objecting to adverse occupancy to a trespasser?

Agnes Gholoonian: Yes, and I can also back that up with, if you… especially if you're, like, clinically depressed, and if you're prescribed a medication, you're automatically not going to have the correct frame of mind to make certain decisions, or to understand what's going on, really, or… I mean, not understand, but, like.

Agnes Gholoonian: I don't know, some people who take specific medications could be numb to it, or, you know, you don't know how a drug is going to affect somebody. So if you're clinically depressed, if you have suicidal thoughts, you may be prescribed something that completely

Agnes Gholoonian: ….

LAX Room 2: Oops.

Agnes Gholoonian: Takes away your abilities.

LAX Room 2: I mean, you're melting my heart. I love you making the art. I love that you… not love you, but I love that you are making the arguments, and you have that confidence. I love it. Melting my heart. …

LAX Room 2: I do think that there is a little bit of a gap, though. …

LAX Room 2: Because, I mean, if what you're saying is someone who's clinically depressed has to take medication and suicidal, I'm just gonna take an AR-15 and shoot up a police department, and, you know, I'm depressed, I'm suicidal, because I want to go out and suicide by cop.

LAX Room 2: Does that mean I should be excused from doing that because I'm depressed?

LAX Room 2: And suicidal?

LAX Room 2: Versus, I didn't know what I was doing because I thought the gun was a banana.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay.

LAX Room 2: We are in this video game.

Agnes Gholoonian: Can I argue something?

LAX Room 2: Yes!

Agnes Gholoonian: Do you believe that that person should have the ability to purchase a gun?

LAX Room 2: I mean… I… we're really deviating, but it doesn't matter if they purchase it or not.

Agnes Gholoonian: That's right, because if you don't want somebody who, in that frame of mind, to purchase a gun, that type of person should also not have the responsibility to….

LAX Room 2: Let's just say knives. Let's just say knife throwing.

LAX Room 2: Ninth Throne, we're doing 9th throw.

Agnes Gholoonian: No, I'm kidding. You know, I mean, obviously, like.

Agnes Gholoonian: I don't know. I guess it depends on the level of depression or suicidal thoughts.

LAX Room 2: Look, I can't necessarily mark you down if that's what you say. Just be prepared.

LAX Room 2: to articulate that someone who is depressed, I can't mark you down. You can get an A+. Just be prepared to

LAX Room 2: Articulate and fully explain how depression is tantamount to insanity.

LAX Room 2: And Sammy could be in Patton Hospital.

LAX Room 2: Right?

LAX Room 2: Patton Hospital.

LAX Room 2: I mean, look, I represent people.

LAX Room 2: Professor Sebastian and I, I brought him on a criminal case, because this guy was so crazy, so insane, I needed another witness. And I remember, he said this to me, it's like, this is when Trump was running the car.

LAX Room 2: Once Trump becomes president, This case is both.

LAX Room 2: It's Trina's own criminal case.

LAX Room 2: Hmm, this case is over.

LAX Room 2: We got off it. We had to get off it. This guy was so nuts. So crazy!

LAX Room 2: So crazy, I can't say it because people could potentially know who the victim is, so, I can't.

LAX Room 2: … But, just remember, though, is…

LAX Room 2: Whatever is going on in the brain of this individual, is that tantamount to insanity?

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: Insanity.

LAX Room 2: So I can't say, so you could say anxiety, I've got really bad anxiety! But is that tantamount to…

LAX Room 2: Being insane.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: Yeah.

LAX Room 2: Once the person regains a sound mind, there's no longer a disability, so the disability is gone.

LAX Room 2: And the clock.

LAX Room 2: for adverse possession.

LAX Room 2: starts to click.

LAX Room 2: Okay?

LAX Room 2: Ask Margian if she's my boss. I think she is. I think she's my boss, because, hey, if she tells me to do something, I'll do it.

LAX Room 2: I consider her my boss.

LAX Room 2: Don't ask me, don't ask me. I just want to know if you're his thoughts?

LAX Room 2: Gee, I think she is.

LAX Room 2: Yeah, she's my boss. Everyone's my boss. Anyways… …

LAX Room 2: Now… Next week, we'll go over some examples of disability.

LAX Room 2: Remember, this is the one area where that one student just had a lot of difficulty.

LAX Room 2: So, we'll go over examples next week, and you'll look at that and say, it's not that bad. How was that part? People's brains are wired differently, okay?

LAX Room 2: So what we'll do next week…

LAX Room 2: is I will give you examples of disability.

LAX Room 2: We will also do a review of adverse possession, okay?

LAX Room 2: We will then be going into the casebook. We will go over the cases of adverse possession.

LAX Room 2: Now, what may be different from your other classes, I think the notes in this class, in the casebook, are very important. I haven't been going over them right now, but I highly encourage you to go through them. Very important.

LAX Room 2: …

LAX Room 2: And then we will get into gift, and I want to spend a good, solid 15 minutes on gift, okay?

LAX Room 2: The next part of the class…

LAX Room 2: is I'm not a very big fan of some of… this stuff.

LAX Room 2: So…

LAX Room 2: If you go to the table of contents, and you go to the second and third page of the table of contents.

LAX Room 2: …

LAX Room 2: I do…

LAX Room 2: Chapter 3, it says Acquisition by Creation. I usually like that. We usually go over that the first class, but they changed the book around.

LAX Room 2: And how to just move certain things.

LAX Room 2: To make people buy a new book.

LAX Room 2: And they added a lot of things that I have not previously gone over, and that is, like, on 188 public domain, all the way down to 264. So we've never actually had that far in 10 years. It was just added in this book, okay?

LAX Room 2: I don't typically go over them, but I usually like to go over copyright, stuff like that, because I think students do find it interesting.

LAX Room 2: But the bulk of what I really want to get into are the cases of adverse possession.

LAX Room 2: acquisition by Gift. I only really care about going into Newman versus Boast.

LAX Room 2: I don't care very much about Gruen, or was it Mafei, or Langer?

LAX Room 2: So I do like Dubin vs. Bose, and everything there.

LAX Room 2: I anticipate that this will take up… maybe I'll go into the cases for acquisition by creation, property on person, we'll see.

LAX Room 2: Then, after that, I'm going to skip that part where it's public domain.

LAX Room 2: So, I anticipate that we… 4 is where we start doing

LAX Room 2: My favorite part of the class.

Dove night: Week 4….

LAX Room 2: Big fours when we go down the slide.

Dove night: Okay….

LAX Room 2: But I…

LAX Room 2: Put down the sign.

LAX Room 2: But I promise you, I will be very patient with you, I will teach it to you, I will be… I promise that I will, do my absolute best you understand it. It's not hard, but I do have to let you out, so I will see you in the matrix next week.
