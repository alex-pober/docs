# Property - Session 11

## Transcript

Tamara Baghdasaryan: That's so exciting.

John Rogers: Alright, what's up, guys?

John Rogers: So, I didn't do a lot of driving today, because I was in court till 11.30, so I have to drive to, basically, Tijuana tomorrow.

John Rogers: So I'm not in too much of a bad mood.

John Rogers: Any questions?

daniel Saghian: Yeah, will we have, like, any review sessions, like, over the weekends, or is it just straight to the final?

John Rogers: What do you mean?

daniel Saghian: like, Saturday review sessions, like, in the middle of the day.

John Rogers: Will we have them?

daniel Saghian: Correct.

John Rogers: like, as… like, I've… previously had.

daniel Saghian: Yeah.

John Rogers: I hate to ask if you want them, because I know your answer.

John Rogers: I can have one this Saturday.

John Rogers: But,

John Rogers: It's, it can't be more than 2 hours, and I have to do evidence as well, so it'd probably be first half evidence, second half property, so I'd just go over an essay for an hour then.

Yessenia Soria: But you say you're available this Saturday.

John Rogers: I can fit it in. I have to go to an event Saturday night.

Yessenia Soria: Me too, it's my birthday, no!

daniel Saghian: It doesn't have to be, like, this week, I'm just saying, like, in general, when we get closer to the final.

John Rogers: Historically, what I do is, after the last class.

John Rogers: I hold, like, 2 more classes that are just optional to attend.

John Rogers: Some are 10 minutes, some are 3 hours. There's optional classes.

John Rogers: I'll have a… reviewed this Saturday.

John Rogers: I could do it Sunday as well, but I'd, like, not want to do Sunday.

Yessenia Soria: I think Sunday's way better.

John Rogers: Bye.

John Rogers: we'll… I mean…

John Rogers: I might be out kind of late on Saturdays. I don't really want to do Sunday, but…

John Rogers: Okay, so what I can do is probably do more, like, 10.30 on Saturday or something like that.

John Rogers: You don't have to go.

John Rogers: You don't have to go.

John Rogers: You don't… so before you start, you know, yelling and screaming, the sky is falling, you can't make it.

John Rogers: I mean, you can always call me with questions, you can always watch the recording.

John Rogers: So… Yeah.

John Rogers: Anyways…

Fatima Razavi’s iPhone: So, should we get on at 11.30? Because you're going to do an hour with evidence?

John Rogers: Yeah, I have to make it, fair.

John Rogers: So, yeah.

daniel Saghian: Can we push for property to 1230?

daniel Saghian: Like, like, you start, like, everything, like, one hour later, so, like, evidence would start… would go until, like, 12.30.

John Rogers: Oh, man, why?

daniel Saghian: The next hour later… Yeah, another classes.

John Rogers: I don't think you guys realize it.

daniel Saghian: You know, I spoke to 6 students today.

John Rogers: They just called me with questions. What's to stop you from just calling me as well?

John Rogers: I'll, think about it. Depends what kind of mood I'm in tomorrow.

John Rogers: I got a lot of driving to do, so I probably won'.

doven: I'll be in a good man.

doven: They have… Yeah, they have evidence mentoring, and criminal procedure mentoring. Cool.

doven: But I'll… I'll probably have to look at the video.

John Rogers: I think evidence is on Sunday, right?

John Rogers: And I only did it for evidence.

doven: you know.

John Rogers: starting late.

John Rogers: But, I don't know, I just don't want there to be any favoritism going on.

John Rogers: So, I'll do both.

John Rogers: Write me a private message if you prefer 11.30 versus 10.30. Write me a private message.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: But you don't have to go, you don't have… it's recorded, you can listen, you can watch, you can do whatever it is you want.

John Rogers: So far, it's 10.30, people want.

John Rogers: I'm more inclined to say 10.30. If you have another class, look, just call me later that afternoon, I'll be in the car, and you can just talk to me about whatever it is that's going on in your life.

John Rogers: This, my apologies. What, what is this?

John Rogers: Where did we leave off last week?

John Rogers: Everyone has said 1030.

John Rogers: Which means that property would start at 11.30.

John Rogers: Or, I could just make you guys 10.30, and evidence at 11.30.

John Rogers: Doesn't matter.

John Rogers: I forgot where we left off, and also, I'd reach out to my counterparts, Professor Safarian, as well as Professor Dolmagian, see if, you can go to their

John Rogers: Reviews or lectures, just jump in, listen,

John Rogers: I don't know if…

John Rogers: you're not gonna take the same final exam as Professor Seferian's class, you're not. I don't know about Professor Dolmagian right now, I haven't spoken to her about it, but just,

John Rogers: I mean, it'd be good for you to go anyways.

John Rogers: going… back. Are there any questions in regards to the material?

Yessenia Soria: I think you said we were going to go over joint tenants.

John Rogers: Oh, so I didn't go over joint tenants?

Yessenia Soria: Yes, I did.

John Rogers: Yes, I did. So I know that's not where I left off, well.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I think you're gonna start landlord-tenant? You're gonna start landlord-tenant.

John Rogers: We are going to start landlord-tenant right now.

John Rogers: I just want to be clear.

John Rogers: Am I starting landlord-tenant right now, or what?

Mireya Gonzalez: know if we could review last week, that would be great before we start, landlord-tenant. Just a suggestion.

John Rogers: He never went into the cases.

Yessenia Soria: He's wearing the glasses, Professor.

John Rogers: What?

Yessenia Soria: I said, she's wearing the glasses.

Yessenia Soria: Mirella.

John Rogers: Oh, okay.

John Rogers: So there's no questions about the material right now? Any questions about creation, severance, anything like that?

Yessenia Soria: Can we review what we went last week, please?

John Rogers: Okay.

Yessenia Soria: I mean, somebody… I mean…

John Rogers: I will spend 5 minutes reviewing.

Yessenia Soria: That's cool.

John Rogers: So, what we reviewed last week were…

John Rogers: co-tenancies. And the most important thing to know about co-tenancies First part of the checklist.

John Rogers: Is the creation of it.

John Rogers: If it's a joint tenancy or tenancy by the entirety, then you look at severance.

John Rogers: But creation, joint tenancy under the common law requires time, title, interest, and possession, the four unities.

John Rogers: to create.

John Rogers: Modern law. It's… Specific language of the grantor's intent to create a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: There are presumptions, For common law, as well as modern.

John Rogers: Modern law presumes the creation.

John Rogers: In the case of hopeless ambiguity, the presumption is tenants in common.

John Rogers: Rarely, if ever, in fact, never, have I ever written a final exam where it is hopelessly ambiguous.

John Rogers: I've never written an exam where you just can't figure it out. It's just so ambiguous, you can never figure it out.

John Rogers: Now, in a joint tenancy, the last remaining survivor Succeeds to 100% ownership interest.

John Rogers: About maybe 2-3 years ago, one of the joint tenants put their interest in a will

John Rogers: And then died.

John Rogers: And half the class started talking about this… this other person gets their interest. No, they don't. They get 0% interest. They died before the other co-tenant. So their will is just… just absolute sweet nothings.

John Rogers: To sever it, Sail to oneself, transfer to oneself, transfer to someone else.

John Rogers: Potentially then, a mortgage. And a mortgage is, one, might, did the person, the, the, the…

John Rogers: Individual who received the mortgage,

John Rogers: make all their payments? Are they… are they in,

John Rogers: Have they made all their payments? Are they up-to-date, and has there been a foreclosure?

John Rogers: The majority view is, it's not going to sever the joint tenancy because the lien theory just simply places a conditional lien subject to full payment.

John Rogers: The minority view, it does sever the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: And the lender would then become tenants in common with the other tenants until the mortgaging tenant pays them back in full.

John Rogers: And if that case, in the minority view, the original tenant

John Rogers: Will then become tenants in common.

John Rogers: With the other tenant.

John Rogers: But the majority view is, so long as the bank has been paid.

John Rogers: They're not going to take title.

John Rogers: And, the joint tenancy resumes.

John Rogers: If the mortgaging tenant dies, While still making payments to the bank?

John Rogers: the bank has no title, has no interest. They only have an interest on what this person has, the mortgaging tenant.

John Rogers: So, as we'll learn tonight, If someone dies.

John Rogers: While they're still making payments on the mortgage.

John Rogers: the other tenant Co-tenant, succeeds to 100% ownership interest, and the bank gets nothing.

John Rogers: Tenancy by the entirety is just joint tenancy plus marriage.

John Rogers: There are ways to sever it, it's much more difficult.

John Rogers: Divorce?

John Rogers: Some type of mutual agreement, and there are, a situate… or one of them dies.

John Rogers: Or, there is an issue that could arise insofar as the reach of creditors, which you'll probably learn in community property, which is transforming into just family law.

John Rogers: Now, it's always important to determine the percentage interest of each co-tenant. So if someone sells, transfers part.

John Rogers: Really try to focus on what does everyone have as far as percentage-wise, because it should help you.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: There is an obligation to compensate another co-tenant if there has been an ouster.

John Rogers: And Alistair is, in essence,

John Rogers: excluding someone from ownership or interest in the property. So, physically stopping them from entering.

John Rogers: You know, a direct statement or express statement of exclusive ownership could suffice, but you'd probably want to look for a little bit more than that.

John Rogers: And it's, in essence, failing to recognize a co-tenant as any right or access to the property. And if that's the case, then the excluding, the tenant that is excluding the other, owes money to the tenant that is being excluded, who is being ousted.

John Rogers: That's also when the adverse possession clock starts ticking.

John Rogers: So you cannot claim adverse possession.

John Rogers: Unless there has been an ouster.

John Rogers: Just can't.

John Rogers: So there must be an ouster.

John Rogers: You know…

doven: Can I ask a question?

John Rogers: Yeah.

doven: So for Joint Tennessee, one is a mortgage, it's the one, getting a mortgage is one way to suburb. What's the other way? Or just sell a, sell a, transfer?

John Rogers: If it's a joint tenancy, just transfer it to someone.

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: Or even yourself.

doven: And what's the majority… what's the, majority rule on mortgage?

John Rogers: the lean theory.

John Rogers: It's in the reading.

doven: Okay, I'll get interviewed.

John Rogers: It's also in my notes, too.

doven: I forget, I apologize.

John Rogers: And just sharing responsibilities between co-tenants. This is kind of a rabbit hole. It does arise, but often students just forget to talk about it. And that is sharing responsibilities insofar as

John Rogers: Repairs, upgrades, and improvements.

John Rogers: Of course, without an agreement, there is no obligation, but the tenant that is making improvements and repairs can seek reimbursement later on if the property is ever sold.

John Rogers: That is the… Cliff Notes version. Are there any questions?

Agnes Gholoonian: Can you go over title theory and lean theory again, and the difference between the two?

John Rogers: When there is a joint Tenancy.

John Rogers: Let's say A and B.

John Rogers: A… Without telling B, goes to Chase Bank.

John Rogers: And mortgages their interest.

John Rogers: in the property.

John Rogers: Never told B.

John Rogers: That's just… nothing. There's no requirement to tell B.

John Rogers: The issue arises on whether or not the mortgage that A obtained from Chase Severs the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: with B.

John Rogers: There is a majority view and minority view.

John Rogers: the majority view… is that… Chase Bank just simply attaches a lien on A's interest.

John Rogers: So whatever A has, they're… have a lien against.

John Rogers: If A stops making payments on the loan, then…

John Rogers: Chase Bank will foreclose on that interest and become title holders.

John Rogers: with A, or with B.

John Rogers: So that would then separate.

John Rogers: But if A makes the payments as,

John Rogers: Up to date on their, on their payments?

John Rogers: And Chase Bank hasn't foreclosed.

John Rogers: A and B are still joint tenants.

John Rogers: If A dies, while that lien is attached to A's interest.

John Rogers: then the bank gets whatever A gets or has at death.

John Rogers: Which is… Nothing.

John Rogers: Because the bank, Chase Bank, never took title.

John Rogers: It's just whatever interest A had at death, which is… Nothing.

John Rogers: Conversely, in the minority view, which is the title theory, Chase Bank actually takes title.

John Rogers: with B.

John Rogers: So it severs the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Regardless of, A, making payments back or not.

John Rogers: If A makes all the payments, Then, Chase Bank.

John Rogers: Sends title back to.

John Rogers: B.

John Rogers: A? Sorry, I'm getting confused. A.

John Rogers: And then A resumes the co-tenancy with B, but has tenants in common, not joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

doven: It says, tenants in common, if they, did they die, or…

doven: In the bank, under the minority view?

John Rogers: Yeah, just the bank has title, so the bank is… tenants in common with B.

doven: Okay.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: Hand raised.

Amir Akbari: Okay, it's not important to say to the other co-tenant, even if you say that you can do the mortgage, right?

John Rogers: I mean, there's just… there's no requirement. There's no requirement, but if…

Amir Akbari: If you say that, that's fine, you can continue on to the mortgage.

John Rogers: You can do the mortgage regardless. It's your interest, you can do it.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Yessenia Soria: Professor, so you're saying on the majority?

Yessenia Soria: View the bank… No, the bank doesn't take title?

Yessenia Soria: I'm in the minority?

John Rogers: title.

John Rogers: Majority, it's just a lien.

Yessenia Soria: It's just a lien. Okay. Okay.

John Rogers: Team theory versus title theory.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, thank you.

Leanna Badar: Professor, I had a question on the minority, the Title III part. So, the Chase will take the…

Leanna Badar: JT, and then now A can continue to make payments, but they'll have to get it back, and tenants in common.

John Rogers: When they get it back? Repeat that one more time.

Leanna Badar: So, the… under title theory, Chase will take the A's interest.

Leanna Badar: And then if A wants to keep paying, then… and they do pay it back, then A will now get their interest back from the bank, but in…

Leanna Badar: Tenants in common instead.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: Anything else.

Agnes Gholoonian: Can you go over partitions again? Sorry.

John Rogers: Yeah, I don't think I talked about that.

Agnes Gholoonian: Can I talk about partition? Okay, so…

John Rogers: So, a partition… there's two types of partitions, partition in kind, and partition for sale.

John Rogers: You need to understand that usually it's difficult to conclude which is better.

John Rogers: the most appropriate. It's really just kind of a balancing test, and you have to measure the equities of the parties.

John Rogers: So, if there are tenants, co-tenancy.

John Rogers: And, for example, one wants to sell it.

John Rogers: But the other one doesn't.

John Rogers: The court will then go, evaluate the best interests of the parties. That's the rule. The court's gonna rule in the best interests of the parties. Thanks for such a clear rule.

John Rogers: So… It's… As we will learn from the cases.

John Rogers: that it's just a balancing test in the equities. Does someone live on the property?

John Rogers: Do they make money? Do they earn a living?

John Rogers: What… what is the reason for selling it?

John Rogers: So the court is going to decide what is in the best interest. Is it to physically divide the property, or just to sell it and let the parties split the proceeds?

John Rogers: That's it.

John Rogers: This has been tested twice.

John Rogers: I think 2 years in a row, if I'm not mistaken.

Agnes Gholoonian: On the bar, or on your final exam?

John Rogers: My final. My final.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay.

John Rogers: The bar, I don't think it's ever been tested within an essay.

John Rogers: That I'm aware of.

John Rogers: Right.

John Rogers: I don't think it's been tested on an essay.

John Rogers: It is appropriate for essays because it's an arguable issue.

John Rogers: You can't really have a lot of arguable issues on a multiple choice.

John Rogers: So… It's usually not found in there. Usually.

John Rogers: Though, multiple choice questions are tough, because it's asking what is the best answer, not what is the correct. It's just what is the best one. And some multiple choice questions that you do, they're all right. It's just what is the better of them, and that's what makes it challenging.

John Rogers: pre-COVID, when students took real final exams,

John Rogers: Usually, that was the death cross.

John Rogers: for students was the multiple choice portion of the final. It was always just tough.

John Rogers: And they're very hard. Second semester property was… it was a very thick packet that they got. The multiple choice questions were sometimes…

John Rogers: A page and a half long, single-spaced.

John Rogers: very long.

John Rogers: But… They're the easiest ones.

John Rogers: Easiest ones. Easiest ones.

John Rogers: But you're not going to get multiple-choice questions.

John Rogers: In this final.

John Rogers: The time aspect is removed.

John Rogers: What makes multiple choice questions difficult is the time constraint, and when you remove that, It's kind of…

John Rogers: Defeats the purpose of them.

John Rogers: If we had real-life final exams again, I would love. You would definitely get them.

John Rogers: Definitely get them.

John Rogers: And you get them in all of your classes.

Alice Orozco: When discussing partition, we argue for both, we discuss both, but do we conclude to one, or just leave it as arguing for both?

John Rogers: Commit. Make a commitment.

Alice Orozco: Okay.

John Rogers: I don't care what you commit on.

John Rogers: Because when I am looking at something, I'm just looking if you make arguments.

John Rogers: And you're discussing certain things, like facts.

John Rogers: I don't really care where you're going, but if you're missing something.

John Rogers: That's kind of just a red flag to me, like, oh, well, then you didn't discuss this.

John Rogers: I will…

John Rogers: we'll go over, and as we can do one tonight if you want, in regards to partition.

John Rogers: Where I'll kind of tell you what I was thinking and where I was expecting students to go.

John Rogers: Discuss.

John Rogers: Anyone else?

John Rogers: Anybody scared?

doven: Hello, hello, hello.

John Rogers: The one person is a little scared.

Mireya Gonzalez: I'm a little nervous, I'll admit.

John Rogers: I've had some of my students today say they're more worried about this class than evidence, and then vice versa.

John Rogers: I don't know.

Agnes Gholoonian: No, I think this is definitely the challenge.

Yessenia Soria: scary.

John Rogers: I think it gets worse next semester, too.

Agnes Gholoonian: Thank you for the hope.

John Rogers: It doesn't get as difficult, like, present and future interest, but you're gonna get double the amount of information.

John Rogers: At least.

John Rogers: I don't like second semester property.

John Rogers: So… I'm probably not gonna be in a good mood next year if you…

John Rogers: Make the mistake of taking me for property, too.

John Rogers: If I'm still teaching property, too.

John Rogers: Is there any other questions?

John Rogers: No questions, I guess everyone is just so smart, and understands it, and just, like…

doven: Nice.

John Rogers: Alright, I guess we'll move into the casebook.

John Rogers: So the chapter begins co-ownership and marital interests on 395.

John Rogers: Notice the second part says, Marital Interests.

John Rogers: We will not be covering marital interests. We're just not.

John Rogers: Not because I don't like marital interests, but because there's an entire class.

John Rogers: on marital interests.

John Rogers: And that is called… Community property, soon to be family law.

John Rogers: So, I don't cover it, because you're gonna be covering that.

John Rogers: So it makes me happy.

John Rogers: 395, the chapter begins with types, characteristics, and… creation.

John Rogers: Notice here. What's the rule for time, title, interest, and possession? Because I haven't opened my book, haven't looked at your notes, haven't done anything.

John Rogers: Well, it's right there.

John Rogers: Right there, that's all you have to do, that's your rule for time, title, interest, and possession for 396. On 396, it's right there.

John Rogers: This,

John Rogers: I didn't note a lot of the important things in this book, because this is the 10th edition. I think I started teaching when it was the 7th edition, and after a while, I just got so tired of having to transfer notes and highlighting, I just didn't

John Rogers: Just didn't do it anymore.

John Rogers: So it might take me just sometimes, like, a little bit extra longer to find some important things that I want to read to you.

John Rogers: And I don't think that the things I read from the book are just not important.

John Rogers: By the way, I spoke to a student today that says that he or she is intimidated by me. I don't get it.

John Rogers: No way. No way.

John Rogers: I don't get it.

John Rogers: I'm not that intimidated, right? I mean, my counterparts are… More intimidated me, right?

doven: Oh, you seem very funny.

John Rogers: It just warmed my heart. But it just got overwhelmed with back to its liquid nitrogen state, so it's gone. It's gone. It's buried in the desert, 9 feet, never to be found. But it was really nice while it lasted.

John Rogers: If we go to 397, the third paragraph down says, tenancy by the entirety can be created only in married couples. So, if, oh, we've been dating for so long, that's not gonna suffice. There must be a marriage.

John Rogers: There must be a marriage.

John Rogers: It must be a legally recognized marriage.

John Rogers: We are married in spirit, though.

John Rogers: If California, for example, doesn't recognize it, then it's just nothing.

John Rogers: The presumption… someone asked,

John Rogers: presumptions. The discussion thus far has hinted how to… how the various sorts of concurrent interests are created. A little bit below.

John Rogers: The common law favored joint tenancies over tenants in common.

John Rogers: So notice, if the instrument conveying property to two or more persons was ambiguous, a joint tenancy resulted.

John Rogers: Modernally, it has… switched. So modernly, if it's ambiguous, it favors the creation of,

John Rogers: Tenancy, tenants in common.

John Rogers: Oh, yeah, there's a lot of important things on this page.

John Rogers: Today, the situation is reversed. The presumption favoring joint tenancy has been abolished in all states.

John Rogers: Woohoo.

John Rogers: Now, under such statutes.

John Rogers: a conveyance, quote, 2A and B as joint tenants.

John Rogers: And not as tenants in common.

John Rogers: Will create a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Something… Even as… even… something even a little bit less, such as… check this out.

John Rogers: 2A and B.

John Rogers: jointly.

John Rogers: Might.

John Rogers: not.

John Rogers: That was on the bar.

John Rogers: 15 years ago, in the assay. 2A and B.

John Rogers: jointly.

John Rogers: So notice the book says, might not. It's not clear.

John Rogers: So you have to argue.

John Rogers: Courts have sometimes thought I could advance 2A and B jointly.

John Rogers: merely indicates an intent to create some type of concurrent estate, but not necessarily a joint tenancy. I say that all the time in lecture.

John Rogers: So I don't know if you guys ever hear me say that, you will notice now.

John Rogers: some states, Require an express provision of survivorship in order to create joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Under these statutes, to create joint tenancy, it is necessary to say 2A and B as joint tenants with the right of survivorship.

John Rogers: A few states have done away with joint tenancy entirely!

John Rogers: So, I think that's, important, because there's no clear rule.

John Rogers: But you definitely want to look at what was the intentions of the creator.

John Rogers: What did they want to create?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Because… keep it at that.

John Rogers: \$3.99… There is a discussion in here about probate.

John Rogers: I don't care very much about probate, because you will take a class called Wills, Trusts, and Estates.

John Rogers: But if you own any assets.

John Rogers: you should get some type of trust or some type of instrument. I don't care how old you are, I don't care if you're 21 years old. Get it.

John Rogers: You can literally write a will.

John Rogers: on… A piece of toilet paper.

John Rogers: Yeah, you can do that.

John Rogers: But, you know, what are assets?

John Rogers: doesn't have to be real estate, doesn't have to be stocks, it could be digital assets like Bitcoin.

John Rogers: Because if you don't have something like that, you could be a little bit of a problem, because it would cost probably more

John Rogers: To litigate and get that than it actually would you getting it.

John Rogers: Kinda like, I'm gonna fight over a \$10,000 car, but I have to spend \$25,000 for a \$10,000 car.

John Rogers: So think about it.

John Rogers: Check out life insurance, too, if you're, like, 21. Probably costs you, like, 8 bucks a year.

John Rogers: Interesting.

John Rogers: I guess we'll jump into the first case, which is Riddle v. Harbin. It's a California case from 1980.

John Rogers: Oh, that was so long ago.

John Rogers: Ancient.

John Rogers: Riddle v. Harmon.

John Rogers: Any volunteers?

John Rogers: No volunteers.

John Rogers: Nobody wants to do it.

Mireya Gonzalez: Professor, I could give some facts.

John Rogers: Oh, I was just gonna ask, can someone just read the facts? Judge Verastigi, thank you.

John Rogers: Who? Who is getting an award on Saturday night? That's where I'm going.

Mireya Gonzalez: Go ahead.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay, so in this case, it was a couple who had purchased a parcel of real estate in joint tenants.

Mireya Gonzalez: However, the wife had retained an attorney to plan her estate, and after… after the attorney reviewed documents, he had advised her that

Mireya Gonzalez: They were actually in joint tenancy, in that upon her death, the property would then pass to her husband.

Mireya Gonzalez: So she had transferred… she had created a will to dis… sorry, she wanted to dispose of her interest by the will.

Mireya Gonzalez: So she had… the attorney prepared a deed.

Mireya Gonzalez: Granting it to herself and an undivided one-half interest in the property, and then it also terminated the joint tendencies that she had with her husband.

John Rogers: So… This is a California case, so this is…

John Rogers: 1st District. I'm not sure where the 1st District is.

John Rogers: Maybe somewhere in No Place California area, who knows?

John Rogers: So, let's think back.

John Rogers: The common law.

John Rogers: says this.

John Rogers: If you… Sorry, did you say that one of them owned the land?

Mireya Gonzalez: No, I said they both purchased the land.

John Rogers: Together.

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes.

Mireya Gonzalez: Taking title as joint tenants.

Mireya Gonzalez: Was I incorrect?

John Rogers: No, you're… you're not in… I'm… might be getting confused with another case.

Mireya Gonzalez: You said Riddle, right?

John Rogers: Yeah, you're, you're right.

John Rogers: Because I don't know if they got rid of another case…

John Rogers: that may have led up to this one, or is there one subsequent to it that I thought was very…

John Rogers: Kind of important to know.

John Rogers: Hold on a second.

John Rogers: Sorry, give me just a few moments.

John Rogers: Okay, makes sense. Sorry, I got confused with something else.

John Rogers: So, here we have a situation where

John Rogers: And I don't know why they're married, so I don't know why this would not be tenancy by the entirety. No problem with me, though. So this was analyzed under a joint tenancy. We have a situation where the

John Rogers: Woman, the female, presumably someone who identified as female,

John Rogers: Decided to terminate the joint tenancy by transferring the property to herself.

John Rogers: So there's two people in joint tenancy. One of them, without the knowledge of the other, decided to transfer, take a deed, and transfer that property to herself in tenants in common.

John Rogers: Without her spouse knowing.

John Rogers: The question arises of whether or not You can actually do that.

John Rogers: This is pre-iPhone, but it's not too far pre-iPhone, so that modern principles still apply here.

John Rogers: This court analyzed This court analyzed the common law rule.

John Rogers: And, in essence, Finding that the common law rule is archaic.

John Rogers: So here's the thing. In order to… we're talking about severance, but in order to create a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: If two persons In order to create a joint tenancy, if one person

John Rogers: Owned the property, it would require a straw person.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: This case then quotes a civil code.

John Rogers: And I don't know what the code is, it's in the book, you can…

John Rogers: Read it left to right yourself.

John Rogers: Where the legislature made it possible for a grantor to…

John Rogers: Create a joint tenancy in themselves, and another.

John Rogers: Without the use of a straw person.

John Rogers: So, when we were in lecture, I told you, to create a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: When someone already owned the property under common law.

John Rogers: It required the conveyance to someone, like a lawyer, and then re-convey it back to these two people for them to fulfill the four unities.

John Rogers: As this case is telling us, California enacted a statute that says, modern, we don't need to do that anymore.

John Rogers: You don't need, modernly, to transfer the property to a third person, and then re-transfer it back, like.

John Rogers: The common law requires.

John Rogers: It is sufficient For someone who's the fee-simple absolute interest holder in the property to just re-execute a deed

John Rogers: Reconveying title to themselves.

John Rogers: And naming the other individual to create a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Does that make sense?

doven: He said, renaming the other to create a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: You don't need a straw person to create a joint tenancy modernly.

doven: Oh, okay. But you need one, common law.

John Rogers: Common law, yes. Mon is 1980, so this is common law. So… Adopting that rationale, Okay? That…

John Rogers: An individual can create a joint tenancy through a single deed.

John Rogers: Means, it wouldn't make sense to say that an individual can't… Sever…

John Rogers: The joint tenancy by simply just executing a deed in themselves only.

John Rogers: So, if a grantor, if someone can create a joint tenancy, Without a straw person.

John Rogers: It logically follows that one of the tenants can sever it.

John Rogers: By executing a deed.

John Rogers: to themselves, and naming the other individual, in this case the husband, as tenants in common.

John Rogers: there was good lawyering in this case, because you know it's good lawyering, I think, when the court is quoting out-of-district cases.

John Rogers: polling

John Rogers: law from other jurisdictions. I always think that's… that's very impressive, especially when the law is silent in California, so yeah, you have to look outside other sister states to see how they, do things. So, I always like that.

John Rogers: Questions?

John Rogers: So what we're extracting from this case is that Modernly.

John Rogers: If there's two joint tenants, one of them.

John Rogers: Can simply just… Reconvey a deed to themself, naming the other, As tenants in common.

John Rogers: And that seppers the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: If you look at my notes.

John Rogers: It will say, somewhere in there, Transfer to oneself.

John Rogers: And the other co-tenant does not have to be aware of it or even know about it.

John Rogers: Questions?

Yessenia Soria: So this is what… The wife did without the husband knowing?

Yessenia Soria: This was before iPhone law. This was common law.

John Rogers: As I said… Yes, it predates the iPhone, but not by much.

John Rogers: So… You know, modern principles apply here.

John Rogers: Okay, so on an essay.

Yessenia Soria: Let's say we get something like this that's common law.

Yessenia Soria: And she did this modern law.

Yessenia Soria: How would you want us to do it?

John Rogers: Good question.

John Rogers: Good question, because I haven't given you the law of how to sever it, Under the common law.

John Rogers: I don't believe under the common law

John Rogers: you can sever a joint tenancy by transferring to yourself. You'd have to transfer it to someone else.

John Rogers: Because this is the case telling us that you can sever it by transferring it to yourself.

John Rogers: So it would logically follow, right, that you can't do that under the common law.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

doven: Well, modern law, you can transfer it to yourself, and common law, you can… you only can transfer it to someone else.

John Rogers: Yes.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: Note number 1 on page 404,

John Rogers: Secret severance that happens all the time.

John Rogers: Note number 2, modern trend.

John Rogers: doing away with… the common law.

John Rogers: the four Unity's creation.

John Rogers: harms versus, I believe it's… Brog?

John Rogers: Am I?

John Rogers: Am I incorrect on that? Harms vs. Sprague?

Yessenia Soria: Correct.

John Rogers: I don't know if I have the correct pronunciation of it, though.

John Rogers: Supreme Court of Illinois. Illinois ain't a bad state. It's okay, they just have terrible pizza because it's deep dish.

John Rogers: Can't be perfect.

John Rogers: It's funny.

John Rogers: Former student of mine, like, 5 years ago, sent me this text message.

John Rogers: yesterday, randomly, of just all these cool pizza spots in LA,

John Rogers: And she's just like, I haven't talked to her in 5 years, and she just sends it to me. Melted my heart.

John Rogers: I was like, I haven't tried any of these. Gotta try it.

John Rogers: Anyways… Any volunteers for the HARMS case? I mean, I've tested this probably twice, maybe?

John Rogers: in my… 12 years teaching this class.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Hi, Professor, this is John, I can do it. Apologies, I would have done the other one, but I couldn't find it, so I tracked this one down. So I can go ahead and give this one.

John Rogers: Are there any objections?

John Rogers: There are zero objections. Go ahead, thank you.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Harms v.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Sprague? It's as good as I can do, too, so…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): You know, let's go with it.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): This was tried in the Supreme Court of Illinois, 1984.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I'll get into the facts. Litigation history's not that important.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): In June of 73, the two brothers, Williams and John, took a title out as joint tenants to a parcel of property in Roadhouse, Illinois.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): June 12 of 1981, they co-signed a \$7,000… or harmed… John signed a co-signed a \$7,000 promising note with his friend, Charles Sprague, to Carl and Mary Simmons to finance Sprague's homes, finance the purchase. To secure the debt.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): John executed a mortgage in an undivided one-half interest in the joint tenancy property. Williams had no knowledge of the mortgage. In 81, John died, leaving everything, by will to Charles.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And later that year, on December 29th of 81, the mortgage was recorded after his death.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Trial court held that the mortgage severed the joint tenancy.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Remained it as a… remained as a lien, and the appellate court reversed, finding no severance and no surviving lien.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Under the rule of law, Illinois law and lien theory, the execution of a mortgage by one joint tenant does not sever the joint tenancy, since a mortgage creates only a lien and does not destroy the unity of title.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And, at issue, was the joint tenancy severed when one joint tenant? You took the mortgage out and his interest in the property, and does that mortgage remain on the lien after the joint tenant's death?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And the court dived into this, reviewed prior precedent between title theory and lien theory, title theory as you explained, lien theory as you explained.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): They looked at a competing case in 54, King v.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Gallarucci established a mortgage is not a conveyance of title, it's merely a lien.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Whether or not the mortgage survived his death, the surviving joint tenant takes the whole estate by operation of law, not a successor of the deceased. And upon John's death, his interest was extinguished, and with it the lien that attached to the interest.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): The Simmons' Morgan… Simmons… Simmons's…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Mortgage lien died with John's ownership interest.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Thus, William became the sole owner of the property, free of the mortgage.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Ruling… the judgment was affirmed by the,

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): court, the mortgage did not sever the tenancy, the mortgage did not survive the death of the joint tenant, and Williams became the sole owner of the property, free of any encumbrance.

John Rogers: That is correct, and we,

John Rogers: discussed that earlier, and this is not directed to you, it's just kind of directed to the class. Did we discuss this earlier?

John Rogers: Anyone? Did we talk about this earlier?

John Rogers: Or am I just.

Alice Orozco: We did.

John Rogers: We did.

John Rogers: We did. This was lean theory versus title theory.

John Rogers: So… What we have here is this.

John Rogers: An individual took out a mortgage.

John Rogers: there was a joint tenancy. Took out a mortgage. Did not tell the other mortgage holder that they were taking out

John Rogers: A mortgage on the property.

John Rogers: And this individual was making payments.

John Rogers: they… did not default.

John Rogers: And the individual, later, died.

John Rogers: leaving… I believe it was John.

John Rogers: So, my name is John. John briefed this case.

John Rogers: And the decedent in this case is John.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): John's all the way around.

John Rogers: So, left the estate to Sprague.

John Rogers: I don't know how to pronounce it.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: The trial court in this jurisdiction held that the mortgage, the trial court held that the mortgage severed the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: But that's not exactly the case.

John Rogers: And therein lies the entire issue that we are here to determine.

John Rogers: did this.

John Rogers: Mortgage.

John Rogers: Sever the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Well, the Illinois Supreme Court Held otherwise.

John Rogers: Because the mortgage did not sever the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: But the mortgage simply created, a lien.

John Rogers: Not a transfer of title.

John Rogers: Consequently, The bank only held a…

John Rogers: A conditional interest.

John Rogers: up until the death of John.

John Rogers: And not longer.

John Rogers: the majority view, which Illinois follows, is the lean theory.

John Rogers: So the bank never took Title.

John Rogers: They just held a security interest.

John Rogers: in John's interest.

John Rogers: But the moment John died.

John Rogers: the moment all of John's interest disappeared.

John Rogers: So the bank… had nothing to gain. That they didn't gain anything.

John Rogers: They never took title.

John Rogers: Had this been a title theory state, the bank would have… be tenants in common.

John Rogers: concert.

doven: So that's true.

doven: So that's the majority and the minority view that we're studying.

doven: So, you know, my…

John Rogers: we're… we're… Studying both, but this case focuses on the majority view.

John Rogers: The majority view is they simply

John Rogers: The bank, the lender, attaches a security interest, a lien, against

John Rogers: The code, the joint tenant's, interest.

John Rogers: But never takes title.

John Rogers: So they don't actually have title interest.

John Rogers: It's just whatever interest John has. But John had no interest at death.

John Rogers: So the bank takes no interest at John's death.

John Rogers: Consequently harms the other brother, Succeeds to 100% ownership interest.

John Rogers: The bank loses. And I love it when banks lose.

John Rogers: I mean, who's pro-bank?

doven: So in the… so in the title theory state.

doven: There'll be, tenants in common.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: the bank and harms would be tenants in common in a title theory. In a lien theory, just as what we're studying here.

doven: Yeah.

John Rogers: There's no severance.

John Rogers: And harms is 100%.

John Rogers: P, simple, absolute, ownership interest. Has, ownership interest.

doven: Is California a title theory or a lien theory state?

John Rogers: I would think that California is a title theory, but I'm just guessing.

John Rogers: So, I don't know. If someone could find out, let me know, I'd be interested in knowing. Drop it in the chat.

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: But I think maybe a good, solid 20 seconds of hard work could probably find it, but…

John Rogers: I'll let you.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: Questions?

John Rogers: someone, dropped it in the chat.

John Rogers: Do you want to take a look?

John Rogers: Read the chat. Any questions on the Harms case? Tested, I think I've tested it twice.

John Rogers: Yeah, I think I've tested it twice.

John Rogers: Twice in the past?

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, so under lean theory, the… the debt… just disappears.

John Rogers: It just… goodbye! See ya! You should have taken title.

gevorg kulikyan: Unless it was foreclosed upon prior to the death.

John Rogers: Correct.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Yes, Professor, when you say it's tested, like, you do the same fact pattern as tested?

John Rogers: I mean, maybe similar.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Thank you.

John Rogers: Questions?

John Rogers: The notes do a pretty…

John Rogers: On page 409, do a decent job in giving you the synopsis of part of its rationale.

John Rogers: I don't remember seeing… Note number 2.

John Rogers: with the hyphens?

John Rogers: I think people call them dashes. Dash?

John Rogers: I don't understand why. I say hyphen.

John Rogers: But it looks a little bit too…

John Rogers: Long to be a hyphen, sort of a bullet point.

John Rogers: I don't remember seeing that in other editions, though.

John Rogers: Multiple bank accounts…

John Rogers: On 412, relations among concurrent owners. This is where we get into partitions.

John Rogers: Concurrent owners might decide, for any number of reasons, to terminate a co-tenancy. If they can agree on a division of the property or the proceeds from the sale, no problem arises.

John Rogers: But… In the not unlikely event.

John Rogers: I don't like that, but… but in… but in the not unlikely, why don't you just say.

John Rogers: But in the likely.

John Rogers: event… that such an arrangement is impossible. Yes, because people don't get along.

John Rogers: Recourse to the equitable action of partition is necessary. Notice it says equitable.

John Rogers: The action is available to any joint tenant or tenant in common.

John Rogers: It is unavailable to tenants by the entirety.

John Rogers: We get into Delfino versus Valensis.

John Rogers: Supreme Court of Connecticut.

John Rogers: Connecticut is right near New York. Good pizza, right? Good pizza?

John Rogers: No? Yes? Maybe?

doven: And I think they have good pizza, because New York has a big pizza.

John Rogers: New York has big pizza. It has, like, New York… a New York…

John Rogers: New York slice pizza, because it's thin, you know? It's big.

John Rogers: I think Connecticut pizza is, smaller. It's, I think, a little bit more crunchier.

John Rogers: The New York style of Connecticut.

John Rogers: My brother swears by it, he says it's the best in the world.

John Rogers: Any volunteers for the… Delfino case?

Mireya Gonzalez: I could give the facts, Professor, if you like.

John Rogers: Please?

Mireya Gonzalez: So in the Tejino case, the plaintiffs were Angelo and William, and the defendant were Helen Valencias, I believe. They had owned a real property, had tenants in common. The property consisted of 20.5-acre parcel of line of a dwelling that was…

Mireya Gonzalez: Occupied by the defendant, along with the portion of the land, where she operated a rubbish-garbage removal

Mireya Gonzalez: removal business. No one actually possessed the remainder of the property, and one of the plaintiffs, who's a residential developer, had proposed to develop the property upon partition into 45 residential building lots.

John Rogers: Huh.

John Rogers: So, really, the issue is, should this have been a partition in kind, or partition for sale?

John Rogers: And… the court?

John Rogers: Really sides in favor of partition in kind?

John Rogers: Versus partition for sale.

John Rogers: So, if the property could be… if it's practical,

John Rogers: and would not be seen as unfair to physically divide the property, the court will do that.

John Rogers: But if it's kind of impractical or impossible in a way, or not in the interests of the owners.

John Rogers: Then the court will then order a partition for sale.

John Rogers: So, this court reversed the trial court In essence, saying that…

John Rogers: A partition in kind, which is physically dividing, would be actually better suited for these parties.

John Rogers: They each had two… Competing ownership interests.

John Rogers: The reason being is that the defendant here

John Rogers: In essence, operated their business, and also lived… they resided on the land.

John Rogers: So, in essence, their livelihood was connected.

John Rogers: And if the defendant loses their livelihood, that would include their business as well.

John Rogers: The plaintiff on this case, though, did not reside on the property, nor did the plaintiff.

John Rogers: Operate anything on the property.

John Rogers: So… I can't remember if they talked about financial reasons,

John Rogers: I believe, and I'm sorry, this case did discuss financial reasons.

John Rogers: Saying that the plaintiff has an economic incentive, because there could potentially be a… an increase…

John Rogers: There was an economic incentive.

John Rogers: Because of potential… property development.

John Rogers: But the court said that economic,

John Rogers: A financial benefit is not completely dispositive.

John Rogers: For one of the parties.

John Rogers: So, in essence, saying that just because it seems more financially sound to sell it, that's not dispositive.

John Rogers: Which, I do agree with.

John Rogers: Because it really would impact the defendant. The defendant lives there, operates a business, and may perhaps have to be forced to shut down the business and move.

John Rogers: So, what the court did was conduct a balancing test.

John Rogers: They examined the pros and cons, and…

John Rogers: Found that the defendant here would be severely affected by the sale.

John Rogers: So the court found that what was in the best interest of the parties

John Rogers: Perhaps to physically divide the property.

John Rogers: So, it was remanded to the trial court.

John Rogers: And parted me, because, you know, I just… I'm not perfect.

John Rogers: I don't believe they actually… the Supreme Court, or the Court of Appeal, the Supreme Court, I don't believe they actually came to a decision what would be best.

John Rogers: But instead, they remanded the case back to the trial court and said, hey, You have to also consider

John Rogers: The equities of both parties.

John Rogers: In essence, consider whether a physical division of the property would be… Mmm…

John Rogers: In everyone's best interest.

John Rogers: So the case was remanded for that reason.

John Rogers: But again, the court didn't actually give us a ruling. They just simply remanded it back down to the trial court and said, trial court, you just must conduct this balancing test.

John Rogers: Makes sense.

John Rogers: So… This case pops up, When you see two or more people fighting.

John Rogers: On whether to sell the land or not.

John Rogers: The analysis is best interest of the parties. What is in the party's best interest?

John Rogers: You must balance the equities of the parties.

John Rogers: I don't care really which way you conclude, but I would be looking for all the important facts

John Rogers: Associated with one of the parties.

John Rogers: One of the sides.

John Rogers: Make sense?

John Rogers: Questions?

Mireya Gonzalez: I do have a question, Professor. For essays, I know you had previously mentioned to discuss both.

Mireya Gonzalez: So under both, you would…

Mireya Gonzalez: You would, analyze whether the partition in kind is the best.

Mireya Gonzalez: And then the partition and cell. So either way, you'll have a conclusion of, like, this is not the best option, and then the other one… another one where it says, like, this is… the best interest would be a partition and cell, like, considering on what the scenario is.

John Rogers: You'd conclude what you think would be the most equitable.

John Rogers: For the parties.

John Rogers: That's all I could really say. But you'd want to measure,

John Rogers: What each party's interest is, what their…

John Rogers: the equities of the parties. That's what you have to measure. And then you conclude however you think you want.

Mireya Gonzalez: Thank you.

John Rogers: You guys wanna take a break now?

doven: Yeah.

John Rogers: Okay, we'll take a 15-minute break, alright?

Yessenia Soria: Okay.

John Rogers: I guess we get started again.

John Rogers: Note number 5 on 421 goes into partition for future interests.

John Rogers: Interesting.

John Rogers: Add that to your Saturday night reading?

John Rogers: I don't think I should be kidding about that kind of stuff.

John Rogers: Well, unprofessional.

John Rogers: Though I don't think I teach in a very professional manner.

John Rogers: Or it's just the untraditional.

John Rogers: I don't think so.

John Rogers: But look, you guys are taking classes with my counterparts, so… You tell me.

John Rogers: I guess we'll go into… Spiller versus Mac… Makarith?

John Rogers: macOS on 44244… 424?

John Rogers: It's in Alabama.

John Rogers: What's in Alabama?

John Rogers: never been to Alabama, but… my evidence counterpart, Peter Sebastian, was in…

John Rogers: Alabama a few years ago, and he called me, and he says, this place has no coffee.

John Rogers: I said, no coffee? He says the place has no coffee, they only drink tea.

John Rogers: And I said, oh my god, and I am never going to that state.

doven: They have no coffee.

John Rogers: So, I've heard.

John Rogers: So I've heard. So I've heard.

John Rogers: I guess we'll go into Spiller.

John Rogers: So, can anyone, any volunteers for this?

Alice Orozco: I can do this one.

Alice Orozco: Spell your…

John Rogers: Go right ahead, I don't think there's any opposition.

Alice Orozco: Any objections from anybody? Yeah.

Alice Orozco: I'm sorry.

John Rogers: exceptions to Alice doing this case?

John Rogers: No one is gonna object to that.

Alice Orozco: Okay. So John Spiller and Hedy Macareth owned a building in downtown Tuscaloosa as tenants in common.

Alice Orozco: They had a lessee there, Otto Wright, which had been renting the building. They actually vacated, and when they vacated, Spiller entered and began using the structure as a warehouse. Macaret then wrote a letter demanding that Spiller either vacate half of the building or pay half of the rental value.

John Rogers: Spiller did neither.

Alice Orozco: And the trial court then awarded Macrith \$2,100 in rent, and then Spiller appealed.

Alice Orozco: And then, since they did not have an agreement to pay rent, there had to be evidence which established an ouster.

Alice Orozco: Macareth tried to prove that with her letter.

Alice Orozco: she tried… that it was sufficient demand and refusal to establish that Spiller's liability for rent. However, the letter did not demand equal use and enjoyment of the premises. Rather, it demanded only that Spiller either vacate half of the building or pay rent, which did not suffice to ouster.

Alice Orozco: The issue at hand, I believe some 426, it said whether a demand to vacate or pay rent is sufficient to establish an occupying co-tenant's liability.

Alice Orozco: for rent has not been addressed… oh, for rent. So that hasn't been addressed in Alabama, but in other jurisdictions, there were several cases that held that the occupying co-tenant is not liable for rent, notwithstanding a demand to vacate or pay rent.

Alice Orozco: And then, Macrith only also tried to

Alice Orozco: say that Spiller put locks on the building, however, he had done that to protect the merchandise that he had stored in the building. And then there was also no evidence to prove that Macrith or any of the other co-tenants had ever requested keys to the locks.

Alice Orozco: And so the court had stated that as long as Boehler did not deny access to his co-tenants, any activity of possession and occupancy of the building was consistent with his rights of ownership.

Alice Orozco: And so the trial court's judgment was reversed, and…

Alice Orozco: There was no… they were unable to find any evidence which supported a legal conclusion of Alster.

Alice Orozco: Yeah.

John Rogers: So, this is giving us an example of the ouster issue, and whether or not an ouster occurred. And it didn't.

John Rogers: So… We have a building.

John Rogers: And two people own this building. They have… An interest in the building.

John Rogers: So… the… Supreme Court of Alabama, I think it's Supreme Court.

John Rogers: Supreme Court of Alabama.

John Rogers: Found that there was insufficient evidence of an ouster.

John Rogers: to prove that Spiller had committed an ouster against

John Rogers: And I don't know if I pronounced the name correctly, Makareth? Is that right?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Sure. Looks good to me.

John Rogers: Okay? Thank you.

John Rogers: Based… on this. Spiller… placed… locks.

John Rogers: On their mutual interest warehouse.

John Rogers: And… Makarith said that placing locks on the warehouse, Constituted that ouster.

John Rogers: But, was that the sole purpose?

John Rogers: As Alice mentioned, That… action of… Changing the locks.

John Rogers: Is consistent with someone trying to… Keep their merchandise safe.

John Rogers: from being stolen.

John Rogers: And… If I'm not mistaken, the prior owners of the warehouse or occupiers, had keys to the prior locks.

John Rogers: So by changing these locks, that prevents everyone from entering.

John Rogers: Now, Did Makareth ever try to enter?

Mireya Gonzalez: No.

John Rogers: There certainly is no evidence that Spiller ever told Makareth that Makareth had no interest.

John Rogers: And Spiller never denied Makarith macro's ability to enter.

John Rogers: Did Makarith send a letter to Spiller? Does anybody know?

Alice Orozco: Yeah, she did. It was just that one letter where she told,

Alice Orozco: To either vacate half of the building or pay half of the rental value.

John Rogers: But… At that point, Makarov hasn't even been ousted.

John Rogers: So, there's no obligation to pay half the rental value to Macareth unless there has been an ouster.

Mireya Gonzalez: There's no obligation.

Mireya Gonzalez: Sorry, Professor, couldn't you say that… his…

John Rogers: Because the way he wrote it, he put…

Mireya Gonzalez: Either vacate half of the building or pay half of the rental value.

Mireya Gonzalez: So when you do say either vacate, because there's that, like, what if, does that have any…

Mireya Gonzalez: Like, does that mean anything?

John Rogers: What if?

Mireya Gonzalez: It… well, not… it didn't use those terms, but it said either vacate.

Mireya Gonzalez: it was like a, either do this or do that. So, because he still mentioned the ouster.

Mireya Gonzalez: Does that not… or that he mentioned to vacate, does that not mean anything?

John Rogers: I'm not following. All… what I just get is a letter was sent to Spiller. Spiller didn't do anything.

John Rogers: And so it kind of looks like Spiller's non-action of not paying rent is… Going to support the ouster?

John Rogers: which they asked to consider in tandem of Spiller's actions of…

John Rogers: Changing the locks? So I'm not quite sure where we're going here.

Mireya Gonzalez: I'll just let you finish and see if you answered my question with the rest of your…

Mireya Gonzalez: How you tackle it?

John Rogers: No. Oh, no.

John Rogers: I was kind of wrapping up.

John Rogers: So,

John Rogers: I forgot where I left off.

John Rogers: So… In this jurisdiction, Alabama.

John Rogers: Which is… Consistent with the majority view, Spiller.

John Rogers: was required to have denied Makarith the ability to enter the premises, and absent that, there is no ouster.

John Rogers: Now… Simply changing the locks alone does not constitute an ouster.

John Rogers: So, let's go back to some of the questions. Simply putting up a no trespassing sign?

John Rogers: Is not, in of itself, consistent with being an ouster.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So this case is introducing us to the concept of ouster.

John Rogers: When you… see this issue arise. Always think about adverse possession.

John Rogers: Where one co-tenant is adversely possessing another co-tenant's interest.

John Rogers: If Spiller

John Rogers: was deemed to have committed an ouster, Spiller would then be responsible for the rental value of half the property to McArith.

John Rogers: Hmm, what else?

John Rogers: They wanted half the…

John Rogers: Rental income. So, in essence, if there was no agreement between Spiller and McElreath where Spiller would pay half the rental value.

John Rogers: The only way that Macareth can enforce Spiller to pay rent is if there was an ouster, and an ouster did not occur.

John Rogers: Now.

John Rogers: Going back to the judges.

John Rogers: Inquiry.

John Rogers: Did I answer that question? Because I don't think I did.

Mireya Gonzalez: Well, yeah, you did. I just got it confused. I got the defendant and the plaintiffs just mixed on who wrote… who sent the letters, so that's where the issue is, but thank you.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Questions?

Amir Akbari: So the stop is not the… like, the sign is not, like, the uster. It should be some sort of prevention, or…

John Rogers: Something like that. Yeah, yeah, because here's the thing, if I have property.

John Rogers: with you, as co-tenant, and I put no trespassing signs, is that saying you can't enter? Or just anyone but you?

John Rogers: Everyone other than you.

John Rogers: Did you try to enter? Did I exclude you?

Amir Akbari: Yeah, if, you exclude me, if you say, don't enter, then, that's gonna start it.

Amir Akbari: You're king.

John Rogers: That's an ouster.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, and then, my other question is, can the, coordinant, could be the adverse processor?

Amir Akbari: Because it's a prayer mission, it's not a trespass.

John Rogers: Can a co-tenant be And…

Amir Akbari: Adverse possessor, because it's here with the permission, right?

Amir Akbari: With the permission of the owner.

Amir Akbari: The code… the other code tenant.

John Rogers: Like I just said.

John Rogers: If an ouster had occurred, and Spiller committed an ouster, that's when the adverse possession clock begins.

Amir Akbari: So, with the situation that the other tenant, other co-tenant living on the property, with the permission, it's not going to be adverse possession, right?

Amir Akbari: Any, anytime, that… it starts when the ouster happens.

John Rogers: I want you to ask your question a little bit…

Amir Akbari: I think about the permission that the co-tenant has.

John Rogers: No, no, no. Give me a scenario, start all over again, because I want to hear it, because I probably might not have the answer, so I want to hear it.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, there are… there are a situation, there is a, like, joint tenancy, or tenants in common. There are two people, two different people, and one of them living on the property, the other one is not.

Amir Akbari: But, the time… if the one who lives on the property wants to be adverse possessor, it should be some sort of ouster, right? And…

Amir Akbari: Other than that, because he lives, or she lives on the property with the permission, it's not any trespass.

Amir Akbari: Right?

John Rogers: There is no… Adverse possession, unless there's an ouster.

Amir Akbari: Oh, s…

John Rogers: Must have that.

Amir Akbari: Okay.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: Now, since you didn't ask the question.

John Rogers: I don't have to say I don't know the answer.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

Yessenia Soria: So, because he didn't try to go into the property.

John Rogers: Who's he?

Yessenia Soria: the co-tenant That means there's no outster.

John Rogers: I don't think they necessarily have to try to go in.

John Rogers: I could simply write a letter from my attorney and say, if you come on the premises, I'll call the police and have you, arrested for trespass.

John Rogers: You don't have to try, you've already gotten…

John Rogers: an express statement from a legal representative of mine saying that I will press charges.

John Rogers: Why would you risk it?

John Rogers: Would that not suffice?

Yessenia Soria: Oh my goodness.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, I have a quick question. So, in this scenario, where the,

gevorg kulikyan: the co-tenant was using the full property, and he's the only one that's enjoying the property. What could have the other co-tenant done

gevorg kulikyan: To make him stop doing that.

John Rogers: Make him stop.

gevorg kulikyan: like,

gevorg kulikyan: So he can also use the other half of the property, because they both have an undivided interest, right?

John Rogers: Let's just say this. There's two co-tenants. One ousters the other.

gevorg kulikyan: But in this scenario, there was no ouster. So, that other co-tenant is just…

John Rogers: I'm saying with the case that we just went over.

gevorg kulikyan: Where he's just using the…

gevorg kulikyan: property as a warehouse. Yeah. And the other guy just can't do anything about it, unless he has been ousted.

John Rogers: It's not like you can't do, you have a 50% say in it.

John Rogers: But it's undivided, so maybe the other person can use it for something else. Maybe I want to, you know, open up a worm farm, who knows?

gevorg kulikyan: But, in this case that we just went over, the guy, Spiller.

John Rogers: Still was using the whole warehouse.

gevorg kulikyan: Not just half, right?

John Rogers: It's an undivided interest, so 50% of that warehouse is MAC address.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah.

gevorg kulikyan: But Spiller was using all of it.

John Rogers: Sure.

John Rogers: Has Mac Earth tried to do anything else?

gevorg kulikyan: Besides sending the letter, no.

John Rogers: So, what's your question?

gevorg kulikyan: Well, and then Spiller refused to do either. He didn't…

gevorg kulikyan: He refused to vacate half, which would have been the correct thing to do for Spiller, no.

John Rogers: You said Spiller or McElithe? Who are you talking about?

gevorg kulikyan: Well, Makareth sent a letter… Okay. …that he, that Spiller either vacate half of the building or pay

gevorg kulikyan: Half of the rent.

gevorg kulikyan: Or rental value.

gevorg kulikyan: But Speller refused to do either.

gevorg kulikyan: So he refused to vacate half of the property, giving Makareth the other half.

John Rogers: Because there was no obligation to do that.

John Rogers: You know, I don't have to give you any money, unless… I've ousted you.

John Rogers: vacate? That is probably more in the contents, context of, give me half, or I'll need you to vacate the other half, so I can use the other half.

John Rogers: But… I don't owe you money, so I don't have to vacate the other half.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, no, I agree that he doesn't have to give rent, but he has to vacate the half, right? But he refused to do either.

John Rogers: I mean, what's to stop MacRuth from just going in and moving 50% of it to another side?

John Rogers: It's 50% of his.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, so Macareth has the right to do that.

John Rogers: Sure.

gevorg kulikyan: Whatever.

John Rogers: to be the…

gevorg kulikyan: Good bet.

John Rogers: 50%?

gevorg kulikyan: Cool.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, that's… so that's what he should have done, Makareth…

John Rogers: It's just there wasn't a complete omission, there wasn't even an attempt to do anything.

gevorg kulikyan: Makes sense.

gevorg kulikyan: Cool.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

John Rogers: Schwartz Baugh versus Sampson.

John Rogers: Court of Appeal of California.

John Rogers: Fourth District. Where's the 4th District?

John Rogers: Y'all know?

John Rogers: It's…

John Rogers: Riverside, Orange County, and San Diego.

John Rogers: It's the 4th District Court of Appeal.

John Rogers: San Diego.

doven: What's LA County?

John Rogers: Second District.

John Rogers: Court of Appeal.

John Rogers: You all will know that when you take… when… Professor David Glassman.

John Rogers: Ruins your summer.

John Rogers: Wonderful man, he's one of my favorite faculty members, and he makes me laugh the most out of anyone at faculty meetings.

John Rogers: Hilarious. He is the funniest.

John Rogers: Very bright, one of the most prominent appellate attorneys in California.

John Rogers: You might see him walk around. His office is basically of the janitor's closet in one of the classrooms at the Valley Campus.

John Rogers: He might just, like, he'll be coming out of a closet, and that's his office.

John Rogers: Schwartzbaugh versus Samson.

John Rogers: Anyone want to give it a try.

Sennett Devermont: I could share some of the facts, Professor.

John Rogers: Okay, does anyone have any opposition?

John Rogers: No one has me.

Sennett Devermont: I don't hear any, so… Mr. and Mrs. Schwartzbaugh, they own land together as joint tenants with a right of survivorship, and against Mrs. Schwartzbaugh's wishes, Mr. Schwartzbaugh, he leased part of the property to Sampson.

Sennett Devermont: who Sampson was, going on to build a boxing pavilion on his leased portion.

Sennett Devermont: In response, Mrs. Schwartzbaugh, she sued both her husband and Samson, seeking to void the lease related to that part of the property. The trial court granted a non-sue, and Mrs. Schwartzbaugh appealed.

Sennett Devermont: some of the facts I had for this.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: If you know, do you know why Mrs. Schwartzbaugh did not like the activity of having boxing on the land?

John Rogers: This is in Orange County.

John Rogers: Well, because with boxing, it came with it…

John Rogers: Liquor and women, so she didn't like it.

John Rogers: But it was in Garden Grove area?

John Rogers: So… Like the Spiller case from before.

John Rogers: This case is similar, because it seems as if Mrs. Schwartzbaugh?

John Rogers: Was a bit premature.

John Rogers: bringing action. So she… it required more, pretty much.

John Rogers: So, the trial court In essence, upheld its long-standing role that a co-tenant

John Rogers: Sharing a joint tenancy, in this case, husband, wife, in this case.

John Rogers: Can lease his or her interest to a third party without it being severed.

John Rogers: So leasing this out for boxing and whatever it is, parties… I want to go to these parties, right? Would not result in a severance.

John Rogers: You'll notice that the court didn't actually articulate,

John Rogers: It's holding exactly, they just simply relied on previous precedent and said, well, precedent says this, so that's what we're gonna do.

John Rogers: The plaintiff, Mrs. Schwartzbaugh, maintained that allowing Sampson on the parcel Operating this boxing pavilion.

John Rogers: She could potentially lose her interest by adverse possession.

John Rogers: But… The court, in essence, said that that argument is meritless.

John Rogers: Because in order.

John Rogers: For there to be any form of adverse possession, even by someone who's there on a lease.

John Rogers: There has to be an ouster.

John Rogers: And in this case…

John Rogers: There had been no ouster. Mrs. Schwartzbaugh was more than welcome to get the boxing ring herself, drink as much booze as she wants, parties as much as she wants, and she was never denied that.

John Rogers: So, it was, in essence, premature.

John Rogers: Had Mrs. Schwarzbaugh been denied access, Perhaps.

John Rogers: That would have been a different story.

John Rogers: There's actually a lot of fact patterns that are derived from this case.

John Rogers: For example, like, A mortgages, her interest, but does not tell B.

John Rogers: There's also a lot of rules in this case that are not found anywhere in your book.

John Rogers: So, make sure… To go over this case again, because there are a lot of rules in this case.

John Rogers: That, are not in the notes.

doven: Hello, Swartzberg, Sampson, just go over this case?

John Rogers: Huh?

doven: He said, go over this case first.

John Rogers: I think just… You should, because there's a lot of rules and concepts in this case.

John Rogers: that… sometimes I don't give you. Like, it might not even be in my notes.

John Rogers: Aww, can't you just give them to us, please? No. Sorry, you're gonna have to be a grown-up and do this yourself.

Tamara Baghdasaryan: Your teacher's not gonna spoon-feed you more and more, as he always does. At least I think I spoon-feed you a lot.

John Rogers: I… I do spoon feed you guys, right?

doven: Yeah, you tried to really help us, yeah.

Yessenia Soria: Yes, you do.

John Rogers: But I'll tell you what, my…

John Rogers: Heart, when it comes to grading finals, is more evil

John Rogers: than your ex, okay? Guaranteed that.

John Rogers: So I am not nice when it comes to grading final exams. Absolutely heartless.

John Rogers: Zero heart.

John Rogers: And I can justify doing that. I… I can do that, okay?

doven: between,

John Rogers: I feel that I can grade that way because,

John Rogers: I do put in a lot of effort and time to you guys, at least make myself available, so I can be hard on you. But plus, I'm also, to be honest.

John Rogers: Realistic, too.

John Rogers: And it's hard.

John Rogers: This is hard. Property is not supposed to be easy.

John Rogers: It's not supposed to be easy.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: I've only given a total of 3 A-minuses since COVID, and 2 of them were last year.

John Rogers: Or last semester, or whatever, last year?

John Rogers: In evidence, there hasn't been an A since the early 90s.

John Rogers: There hasn't been an A in evidence since the early 90s.

John Rogers: So it's supposed to be hard.

John Rogers: Questions on Swarzbaugh, or anything else?

John Rogers: The rules that I provided you as well, and some important ones, are right here.

John Rogers: On page 434.

John Rogers: And it's telling you about rents and profits.

John Rogers: Taxes, mortgage payments, other carrying charges.

John Rogers: Repairs and improvements for note number 4?

John Rogers: Everyone.

John Rogers: Misses this on a final.

John Rogers: So just be very, very, very… Cognizant about this.

John Rogers: Because many students forget to talk about this unless it's glaringly apparent, and it never is.

John Rogers: And I will catch you guys. I will catch you guys on it.

John Rogers: I will catch you.

John Rogers: And if we go to the next page, which is 436, it's over. Goodbye. We are done with co-tenancies. That wasn't too bad, because next is marital interests, and we do not cover marital interests.

John Rogers: So, any questions?

doven: I'm scared for the fire.

John Rogers: Excuse me?

John Rogers: I didn't catch that.

doven: I'm scared for the rhino.

John Rogers: You're scared? Okay. Well, it's good! Gets you fuel. It's good! You should be scared, it's good.

John Rogers: It's good. But in the time, so when you get it, remember, you got that 24 hours to watch a movie, and, like, hang out, maybe make a, you know, a long dinner, and just relax, and… I don't know, maybe go to the park.

John Rogers: I'm just kidding. You're gonna be okay.

John Rogers: Gonna be okay.

Isabella Salahshoor: I'm gonna use some of that time to cry.

John Rogers: It's okay, look.

John Rogers: I'm here to help you, and I always dramatize final exams, okay?

John Rogers: Yay.

John Rogers: You're gonna be just fine, don't worry, alright?

John Rogers: Just fine.

John Rogers: And I, I promise you this.

John Rogers: Before you get your final, I will have dropped so many hints.

John Rogers: It's not even gonna be funny.

John Rogers: So, don't stress yourself out, it's okay. I just, you're gonna be okay.

John Rogers: I always, psych you out.

Yessenia Soria: I swear, I dream property.

Yessenia Soria: I rap. I'm going over the definitions in my mind, and I'm like, oh my god, I'm, like, seriously traumatized with this class.

John Rogers: It sounds like you love it, so why don't you marry it?

Yessenia Soria: No, because they don't take my property.

Yessenia Soria: Not after what I learned about interest and all that? No. I'm okay, also single.

John Rogers: Is their own.

John Rogers: In the questions?

John Rogers: No questions?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Do you take calls during finals, also?

John Rogers: No, I can't do that. I can't take all… once finals go out, I am gone. I am retired.

John Rogers: I am retired, I can't… I can't take any calls. I can't take any emails or calls. So, what happens is if there's any issues, like there's an error or something, contact Patty White, shoot her an email, she will then contact me, and then I will send her an email, and then she will send you all the email. So…

John Rogers: But yeah, unfortunately, our hands kind of have to let go.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: But it's okay, it's okay, you'll be fine.

John Rogers: Now, any other questions before we either, one, move on to landlord-tenant, or two,

John Rogers: Or two, you want to go over an essay?

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes.

Mireya Gonzalez: I know earlier in the class you said, to go over an essay that had the ouster. That'd be very helpful.

John Rogers: I think it… I said partition.

Mireya Gonzalez: Oh, either or.

John Rogers: whatever, just go over something, right? Okay.

John Rogers: Don't know which one.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Can you do the Alice in Wonderland?

John Rogers: That's not gonna partition.

John Rogers: Alice in Wonderland is probably more closer

John Rogers: Are you the one that keeps asking about Alice in Wonderland?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I don't know why, I feel like it'll help a lot of people.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I'm not sure why, though.

John Rogers: You feel that Alice in Wonderland will help a lot of people?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I think so, I don't know.

John Rogers: Well, there's an Alice in this class, why don't you ask her?

John Rogers: Hold on, let me go to question 2… 8. I'll do the partition, it's not that bad.

John Rogers: I didn't either.

John Rogers: Okay, number 26.

John Rogers: This had… did not have a lot of issues at all. Question number 26. This was one year ago!

John Rogers: This is one year ago?

John Rogers: Let me have a minute.

Alice Orozco: Yeah, it says Fall 2024.

John Rogers: I have a feeling this is 2023.

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: So, this has partition, so let me know if this is okay, because I don't think we have to spend too much time on it, which I would love.

John Rogers: Yes? No? Maybe?

John Rogers: Anybody there?

Agnes Gholoonian: Yes, that's 2000.

John Rogers: Okay, we'll do that one.

John Rogers: Now, remember, I'm gonna say this again and again, I'm here to help you, okay? Here to help you, so if you need help, let me know. Let's be friends now.

John Rogers: I would love more friends, okay? So let's be friends now. I don't wanna get… I don't wanna be friends with you week 15, okay?

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: What are the rights, title, interests held by Alice, Barb, Cara, Dan, and Ed? That's a lot of people, and it's a little bit overwhelming, you know? Very overwhelming.

John Rogers: How should the court rule on Dan and Ed and Alice's dispute about whether to sell Blackacre?

John Rogers: I remember writing this.

John Rogers: And I was trying to find a sentence.

John Rogers: Where it wouldn't be as revealing of what I wanted to ask.

John Rogers: But this was the best that I could do.

John Rogers: So, here we go.

John Rogers: Oz. The reason I chose Oz is because it's quick, And it begins with O.

John Rogers: Oz owns Blackacre and Feastimple Absolute, the first issue. It's a foundational issue.

John Rogers: V simple absolute. Boom. That's the first thing I'd start talking about, real quick, FSA, okay?

John Rogers: It's a 10-acre parcel of land. Now, it could have just said, parcel of land.

John Rogers: But it's a 10 acres? I don't know why, so I'll just put a little…

John Rogers: yellow theme-a-jig right there. Just figure out, why does it say 10 years.

John Rogers: And that's the beauty of law exams. The moment you start recognizing sentences that

John Rogers: add more than necessary? It's important.

John Rogers: the southern half of Black Acre, okay, the southern half, southern half.

John Rogers: southern half of Black Acre.

John Rogers: contains a large creek, and several steep, rocky hills. I know where this is going.

John Rogers: A large creek.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: in… 2003.

John Rogers: Why is that there? In 2003, why would that be there?

Agnes Gholoonian: The adverse possession timeline.

John Rogers: I would think so, maybe there is an adverse possession claim.

John Rogers: Yeah, perhaps.

John Rogers: So, 2003.

John Rogers: Nope, this exam was 2-2023 final exam, because if it was 2020-24, this would have said 2024. It's… this is 2 years ago.

John Rogers: Oz conveyed Blackacre by valid deed. So the reason you see valid deed, as I said over and over, it prevents the cowboys and cowgirls from questioning the validity of the deed, which is a second semester issue.

John Rogers: His…

John Rogers: His two best friends.

John Rogers: I want you to tell me How this is significant.

John Rogers: And that's tough.

John Rogers: Alice and Barb.

John Rogers: We have an Alice in this class, Barb, as co-tenants in common with a right of survivorship.

John Rogers: What is going on there?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Well, we're creating.

John Rogers: A code tenancy of some sort, right?

John Rogers: So… What is that co-tendancy?

John Rogers: And why?

Alice Orozco: It's joint tenancy because it has the language of right of survivorship.

John Rogers: Why is that important?

John Rogers: But, cuz, cuz… you know, speaking of Alice, because Alice… well, there's a conflict here, because Alice is…

John Rogers: Of course Alice wants a joint tenancy, because Alice is the one named in the fact pattern.

John Rogers: I was trying to be funny, but okay. But it says… Co-tenants in common, though.

John Rogers: So, first, we've identified there's a problem here.

John Rogers: There's a problem because it says tenants in common of some sort, but it also says right of survivorship.

John Rogers: So we have to tell the grader that this is a problem here.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: How do we measure what Oz intended to convey?

John Rogers: And Alice.

John Rogers: What do you think?

Alice Orozco: What was your question? Sorry.

John Rogers: What do you think it is?

John Rogers: Two of you already said it, but I just want to hear why.

Alice Orozco: Well, I think it's because of the language, the right of survivorship language.

John Rogers: Why would you say that that is more controlling than the tenants in common language, or co-tenants in common language?

Mireya Gonzalez: Is it because something with survivorship, I know you had on it last class.

John Rogers: Well, it's just my opinion.

John Rogers: But I think that the survivorship language Okay? Is the most controlling.

John Rogers: Because that evidences what O intended for the property.

John Rogers: Upon the death of either Alice or Barb.

John Rogers: And that is to award 100% ownership interest.

John Rogers: To the survivor, the longest remaining survivor.

John Rogers: The fact that it says co-tenants in common may just be more of an indication of an intentions of creating some form of co-tenancy. But what is very… what's more controlling and trumps it is the right of survivorship. Now, going back to the casebook.

Fatima Razavi’s iPhone: Professor, how would you want us to write that in an essay? I think that you can do it.

John Rogers: yourself, and send me an essay, and I will see how you do.

Fatima Razavi’s iPhone: Are you gonna have time to review our essays?

John Rogers: If you get it to me sooner than later, before I start getting much more friends.

Fatima Razavi’s iPhone: I hope you make no friends.

doven: Okay, I'll try to send this. You want us to write… He intended them to…

doven: The right of survivorship as…

doven: joint tenancy, or whatever. Co-tenancy would just say you wanted some kind of tenancy and right acceleration.

doven: He intended…

John Rogers: If we go to 397 again, what I read to you before.

John Rogers: And it's 6 lines up. Courts have sometimes thought a conveyance of 2A and B jointly merely indicates an intent to create some type of concurrent estate, but not necessarily a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Okay? So, analogizing that here is that we could say that the intentions are to create some form of concurrent interest, but not necessarily tenants in common.

John Rogers: Because that would make sense based on the survivorship right provision here.

John Rogers: Make sense?

John Rogers: joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Thereafter… thereafter means in… this is going in chronological order, this is going in order, okay?

John Rogers: Alice moved on to Blackacre. Good for you, Alice!

John Rogers: Due to the northern half, Being ideal for development.

John Rogers: Alice built a home and grew a field of orange trees. Good for you, Alice.

John Rogers: I'm coming over, have some fresh orange juice.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Notice here, She's using the northern half.

John Rogers: And she lives there.

John Rogers: And she grows things there. Maybe it's a business? I don't know. But it sounds like her livelihood might be on the northern half of Blackacre.

John Rogers: Years later, when? We don't know. Without informing Alice.

John Rogers: Oh, you're awful, Alice. No, Barb.

John Rogers: Barb sold her interest in Blackacre to Kara.

John Rogers: So, right here is joint tenancy.

John Rogers: severance, right?

John Rogers: So, 50%, 50% in tenants in common.

John Rogers: So that means… Cara and Alice.

John Rogers: have 50-50 ownership interest in tenants in common.

John Rogers: Notice, without informing Alice. Oh, God! Barb is awful! Barb needs to be shot! Shoot her in the head! Kill her!

John Rogers: That's terrible! The sky is falling! Doesn't matter. That's nothing. All you see there, all that really means is just pixels. That's no legal significance whatsoever. That's just pixels on a computer screen.

John Rogers: In 2006, so this is 3 years later?

John Rogers: Barb and Cara died in a car accident.

John Rogers: Oh, that's so sad.

John Rogers: I wonder if flowers were… I mean…

John Rogers: Can someone text them? Oh, this is terrible.

John Rogers: So what's the question? What's the question?

Sarah Downs: Yeah, hi, it's Sarah. Question. For the interest that went to Clara, to Kara.

Sarah Downs: That joint tenancy is no longer there. It's now a tenancy in common.

John Rogers: Yes. Because the joint tenancy that Barb and Alice had together was…

John Rogers: severed because Barb sold her interest to Kara.

Sarah Downs: Right. Okay.

John Rogers: So it severs it. So, right now, if Cara or Alice dies, 50% of their interest goes to their heirs.

John Rogers: 50% of the interest in Blackacre goes to their respective heirs, whereas 50% is held by the other co-tenant.

John Rogers: Barb and Cara died in a car accident.

John Rogers: I'm so sorry.

John Rogers: Probably texting.

John Rogers: Kara's heirs were her two siblings, Dan and Ed. Okay, so now… Dan and Ed.

John Rogers: to them, succeed to Kara's interest.

John Rogers: You with me so far?

doven: Because they joined… because they joint com… tenants in common.

Agnes Gholoonian: Wait, sorry, please repeat that again, I'm so sorry, please repeat that again.

John Rogers: Let me back up.

John Rogers: Alice and Barb, initially.

John Rogers: Had a joint tenancy, okay?

John Rogers: Whereas, the last remaining survivor, Wins 100%, gets 100% ownership interest.

John Rogers: Barb.

John Rogers: sold her interest to Kara.

John Rogers: That severed this.

John Rogers: So now, Alice is tenants in common with Kara.

John Rogers: Which means that if Kara dies, 50% of that interest goes to Kara's heirs. If Alice dies, her interest, which is only 50%, goes to her heirs.

John Rogers: So, in this situation, Kara dies.

John Rogers: Her heirs were Dan and Ed, so that means Dan and Ed

John Rogers: are tenants in common with Alice.

John Rogers: And Dan and Ed each have 25% interest.

John Rogers: You with me so far?

Agnes Gholoonian: Yes.

Agnes Gholoonian: Got it.

Mireya Gonzalez: Professor, I have a question. For essay purposes, because we discussed tenants in common for… with Cara and Alice.

Mireya Gonzalez: and then you did it again with tenants in common for Dan and Ed, would you just, like, do tenants in common and then under it tenants in common, or would you specify, like, tenants in common? Like, would you specify the names, I guess is what I'm saying, because you did tenants in common twice.

John Rogers: That's fine.

John Rogers: You can do it twice, you can do it, successors and interest?

John Rogers: I just want to be able to follow where you're going, okay?

John Rogers: Because if you're on a calculus final and you say it's 3.2, Great. How'd you get there?

John Rogers: Well, I just copied someone.

John Rogers: So, we have Dan and Ed, our tenants in common with good ol' Alice.

John Rogers: Dan and Ed learned that the value of Black Acre may increase in the future.

John Rogers: This is where students got absolutely SLAMMED by me.

John Rogers: Never, on a take-home, 24-hour final exam, never, ever misquote a fact pattern.

John Rogers: Ever do that.

John Rogers: It drives me nuts. For a take-home final, many students wrote, will increase.

John Rogers: And it drove me… Nuts.

John Rogers: to read that.

John Rogers: It says, May.

John Rogers: Increase.

John Rogers: So we have to think of now the equities of Dan and Ed.

John Rogers: Because I know that's where we're going, and that's a partition.

John Rogers: You're not.

doven: What about Alice?

John Rogers: Who cares about Alice? She's living her life eating oranges.

John Rogers: I mean, we have an Alice in the class now, we don't see any oranges in her hands, do we?

John Rogers: So, we have to look at the equities of… Dan and Ed.

John Rogers: Yes, question.

Mireya Gonzalez: When you… when… so when it's like… when the fact pattern is like that, where they kind of…

Mireya Gonzalez: Infer equities, it would always go to a partition.

Mireya Gonzalez: Following.

John Rogers: I just know where this is going, so I know what I have to look out for.

Mireya Gonzalez: So someone who doesn't know where it's going, like, that's when you would… when there is equity, that's when you would know what comes after, is the partition?

John Rogers: I think so.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay. I mean, I read a fact pattern twice.

John Rogers: So, it's like… I know what it's about, and then I go back and try to…

John Rogers: Piece it all up.

doven: So, when we see something like May increase, do we write equities, or do we write partition?

John Rogers: This is… this is what I'm… I'm just thinking out loud when I write equities, okay?

John Rogers: the students… Dan and Ed are going to claim an economic interest in selling.

John Rogers: So, it means… That they want to sell this, because…

John Rogers: The property value may increase, and maybe they can get a better profit, and maybe people want it.

John Rogers: Who knows?

John Rogers: So, if I sell you my house, and I'm telling you, hey, my house could be worth \$150 million in a few years…

John Rogers: get real, but I said nay.

John Rogers: So, I use the word may because it's not will.

John Rogers: It's just might. Could go up, could down, who knows? So there is sort of this speculative…

John Rogers: increase? Maybe? I don't know.

John Rogers: But whatever.

John Rogers: I just went nuts when people went.

John Rogers: Will. And I just went, ugh.

John Rogers: God, don't misquote a fact pattern.

John Rogers: Do not ever misquote a fact pattern.

John Rogers: So when students call me and they say, Professor, you said, bing, I am listening very carefully about what students say. What did I say?

John Rogers: Don't misquote me. In 2023, so that is 20 years later, how is that relevant? There hasn't been an ouster yet that I can see, okay?

John Rogers: 20 years.

John Rogers: Find a home for that.

John Rogers: Dan and Ed wish to sell Blackacre to several prospective buyers, so there are potential people that want to buy it.

John Rogers: Dan and Ed attempted to convince Alice to join in the sale of Blackacre. Come on, Alice! Just sell it, please! Alice stood her ground and refused, claiming that she has resided in Blackacre since 20…

John Rogers: Oh, man, I can't believe I gave a class that. I was hoping that they could infer that, more of an inferential, but I just wrote it here.

John Rogers: And her sole income is based on selling oranges to local grocery stores.

John Rogers: So, her livelihood, and she has lived here for 20 years. So she definitely has ties to this land.

John Rogers: So Dan and Ed file a lawsuit against Alice, seeking an order to sell it.

John Rogers: Now notice, what issues have we discussed so far?

John Rogers: so far, that we've discussed is, what, an FSA? Joint tenancy creation, right? Joint tenancy creation, joint, tenancy severance?

John Rogers: Maybe… You might want to talk about rents.

John Rogers: Rents, profits, right?

John Rogers: Because it does say that she's earning profit from the land.

John Rogers: And lastly…

doven: position.

John Rogers: Yes, partition.

John Rogers: Now, notice here, this is not a racehorse question. If you had to do this in one hour, you could do this in one hour.

John Rogers: So, this is not… something that's…

John Rogers: Oh, no, how am I gonna finish this? You have plenty of time.

John Rogers: Which tells me this.

John Rogers: This is a very thoughtful discussion that requires…

John Rogers: In-kind? In-kind discussion?

John Rogers: and sale discussion. So… Is it better to…

John Rogers: Sell the land, or divide it? What do you guys think?

doven: In best interest, probably divided, but that's her livelihood.

Amir Akbari: I think there is a fact, it says the large creek and several steep rocky hills.

John Rogers: I think this…

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: So, wait a second!

Amir Akbari: We couldn't do the… Kind.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Amir Akbari: Just sell that.

John Rogers: Because that would be so imbalanced, right?

Amir Akbari: Yes.

John Rogers: The land is not, like, a flat piece of paper.

John Rogers: Look at it! There's hills and a large creek?

John Rogers: So… But… what side… Is the large creek or the steep hills on?

Agnes Gholoonian: South, opposite of where Alice's is.

John Rogers: Oh, shoot, I wrote that. Dang, you're right! You're right! I wrote that!

John Rogers: I shouldn't have wrote that. But yes, you are correct, the southern half. And notice that

John Rogers: The northern half is ideal for development.

John Rogers: So wait a second.

John Rogers: How is it fair to both Dan and Ed, that… Alice… Gets the most ideal Area of the land.

Agnes Gholoonian: She's been there longer. She put her efforts in growing the trees.

John Rogers: Well, so what? We could have done the same thing, she was just… she just jumped in on it.

Agnes Gholoonian: But they didn't.

doven: It's her livelihood, I mean, that's her income, I mean, she needs to survive. But on that…

John Rogers: what? I got 50%, so I'm gonna say, we're gonna… we're gonna tear down some of these trees. I'm gonna… I'm gonna start growing heroin.

John Rogers: Or crack! I want to open up a meth house!

Agnes Gholoonian: I mean, that would definitely work in Alice's favor.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, we should do the balancing test here, right?

Amir Akbari: which…

John Rogers: Which one is more beneficial for postpartum? This is the balancing test. So, in this exam, I don't care what you say.

John Rogers: But I'm looking for you to use all types of facts. It's 10 acres, so the northern half, is it 5 and 5? I don't know! I don't know how it's distributed exactly, okay?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: But it says Southern Half.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Half of 10 for that.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Will that make it 5 and 5?

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: I don't know if it's equal.

John Rogers: Someone text Alice and let me know.

doven: We'll write balancing tasks, and then we'll come up with our own conclusion.

John Rogers: So, what I have here in green…

John Rogers: That was built a home and grew maybe this two, but it's kind of repeated down here.

John Rogers: So maybe I'll put that in, like, teal.

John Rogers: What you see highlighted in green and maybe teal, you have to discuss.

John Rogers: Must be discussed somewhere.

Agnes Gholoonian: Come on, Professor, sorry. Because Alice built a home and grew the orange trees, she was living on the land when the other two were not, because it was not ideal for…

Agnes Gholoonian: For building things, right? For renovation or whatever.

John Rogers: Well, fine, okay? I don't like the analysis of, I was here first.

John Rogers: But I like the analysis of, she's been here a long time, but not that, I was here first.

Agnes Gholoonian: Oh, but she's living on the land. Would that make a difference?

John Rogers: Big time! Her livelihood's on here. You want me to move and move my business? That's what I've been doing! What am I gonna do now?

John Rogers: I'm gonna die!

Amir Akbari: And the other side could argue that…

John Rogers: to Hollywood.

Amir Akbari: And the others could argue that they didn't have any profit, and they gave up their profits

Amir Akbari: And Alice is using the land without paying anything, right?

John Rogers: Well, she's being selfish. She gets the.

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: We can't do anything?

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: So, what we can say for sure is that in-kind may not be the best option? I don't know, because it really depends on where is this large creek with several steep, rocky hills.

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: There's a lot of this I don't know that we could easily get the answer if we just sent a text to Alice, but unfortunately, this is a fictional person.

John Rogers: So you'll never get a response.

John Rogers: So, you're gonna have to do this the old-fashioned way, and argue.

John Rogers: So… But I'm looking for these facts.

John Rogers: And please, for the love of God, whatever God you pray to, doesn't matter.

John Rogers: Please, do not misquote a fact pattern.

John Rogers: And that's it. That's it. That's it. That's all you really had to talk about. This wasn't hard.

doven: Give us this.

John Rogers: What?

doven: Can you give us this cop, this paper?

John Rogers: Sure!

Amir Akbari: Can we have a short discussion of Ulster here?

John Rogers: But where's the ouster?

Amir Akbari: at the end, Alice said.

John Rogers: Dan and Ed attempted to convince Alice to join the sale. Alice refused, claiming that she has resided on Blackacre since 2003.

John Rogers: And her sole income! I mean, jeez, she's been on that land

John Rogers: Longer than some people in this class have been alive.

doven: And now… oh, folk.

Amir Akbari: But do we need to have a short discussion of Ulster, or no?

John Rogers: No.

Amir Akbari: It… no.

John Rogers: No discussion of Alistair. Get rid of it.

Amir Akbari: How about the improvements?

John Rogers: I wouldn't have one about improvement.

Amir Akbari: That's…

John Rogers: But…

Amir Akbari: at the kind… at the sale point. If we conclude that that's gonna be partitioning, say.

Amir Akbari: then we can bring that… the value of the, improvement, and, as a remedy to the Alice, or no?

John Rogers: What I'm saying is this, sharing profits for sure, because she's profiting from the use of the land, growing things from the land. So if she is growing

John Rogers: Plants that are used to manufacture cocaine and sell to the cartel.

Amir Akbari: She's going to have to share those proceeds, because those plants are pulled from the earth.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, that makes sense, thank you.

John Rogers: I just dropped the question in the chat with some of my… Colors.

John Rogers: But, class is done. I'm supposed to, according to the school policy, have let you out.

John Rogers: Five minutes ago.

John Rogers: So you all have a wonderful week, I will see…

John Rogers: Maybe some of you this weekend, as I'm having both an evidence and property review.

John Rogers: There's also an evidence review I heard on Sunday, so if you are in evidence.

John Rogers: You better be going, because the two people

John Rogers: that are mentoring are super-duper smart. The smartest of the smart.

John Rogers: Two that I will remember for a very long time.

John Rogers: That's all I got. Have a wonderful…

John Rogers: life, and I will stick around if you guys have any questions.

John Rogers: But don't be scared about the final.

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, I have a quick question about the essay we just went over.

John Rogers: Yeah.

gevorg kulikyan: Mom.

gevorg kulikyan: Let me pull it up, give me one second. So, in that… in one of the cases that we went over today, there was… let me see which one was it… the Delfino one.

John Rogers: Yeah, the one with the pretty picture with the family that's black and white.

gevorg kulikyan: Yes. I remember there was, like, discussions about, like, zoning…

gevorg kulikyan: Development issues, things like that, if the…

gevorg kulikyan: Like, the zoning department would allow them to split for, like, the subdivision.

gevorg kulikyan: Would that be… like, should we even mention that in this scenario? Because it's kind of weird to subdivide a property north and south.

gevorg kulikyan: If that makes sense.

John Rogers: No, because if you go to, you know, parts of Malibu, which…

John Rogers: It's probably burned up, but if you go to, like, Laguna Beach.

John Rogers: You have houses built on hills like that?

John Rogers: So, zoning is next semester, so don't worry about that.

gevorg kulikyan: melted.

Alice Orozco: Thank you, Professor. Good night.

John Rogers: Sorry to call you out so much, Alice, where she's going.

Andre Hakobyan: Thanks for having me.

Agnes Gholoonian: Thank you, Professor. Have a good night and a good weekend. Professor, I have a question about the essay that we just did.

Agnes Gholoonian: So when… if we're discussing this, and we're writing it out, and for, like, let's say question number one, we… for Alice, I understand that we go through all of that, but for Barb and Cara, do we say, like, they're dead, they don't get anything?

Agnes Gholoonian: And then we continue with Dan, and then we discuss the same things all over again, or would we… well, no, we wouldn't. For Dan and Ed, we can't start with the joint tenancy creation or joint tenancy severance, because it…

Agnes Gholoonian: We would just do tenants in common. We discussed tenants in common first.

John Rogers: Organization, like, what you're…

John Rogers: Talking about it is important.

John Rogers: But it's just not important to me.

John Rogers: you don't have to mention any organization, any headers, like, this is Alice's interest, this is Bob's interest. What I wrote, if you just simply just do whatever I wrote.

Agnes Gholoonian: But you expe…

John Rogers: Explain where you're going in your discussion?

Agnes Gholoonian: Right.

John Rogers: All that matters to me.

Agnes Gholoonian: My biggest issue with essays is, like, with Marjanyan, I took her legal writing class, and she's phenomenal, you know, everything was broken down, very organized, very well put together. However, when I'm going over bar essays that I see, like.

Agnes Gholoonian: the California Bar chose this specific essay. It has, like… I mean, of course it has some sort of structure, it's not like…

Agnes Gholoonian: you know, but it's not as organized as the way that Marjanian taught us. So if we don't stick to that same exact

Agnes Gholoonian: structure that Marjanian taught us, and kind of lean towards more of, like, focusing on writing a essay in, like, a shorter amount of time.

Agnes Gholoonian: Would that be okay?

Agnes Gholoonian: I just need to write an essay. I need to write an essay and send it to you. That's what I.

John Rogers: Yeah, you need to do that. That's what you need to do. But… I'm… not…

John Rogers: I am, for organization, for the bar, is all about it.

John Rogers: It's just, for me, I… I'm not… I don't care much for organization.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay.

John Rogers: It's always important But I don't care…

John Rogers: you know, my quote-unquote issue outline is not gonna have Alice. What is Bob's interest? What is it? It's just gonna have partition, in-kind, sale, fee simple absolute, joint tenancy creation. It's not gonna say who…

John Rogers: It's…

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay. And you're the only one that's reading it, like, we're not gonna have somebody else also reading our final?

Agnes Gholoonian: Because if you, like, if you're not strict with it, that's fine, but I need to know if somebody else is strict with it.

John Rogers: this other person… is… as strict as I tell her to be.

John Rogers: Okay, okay, no prob- no worries, okay. She's been grading for about 3 years.

John Rogers: And, initially, she was very hard.

John Rogers: Does she…

Agnes Gholoonian: Except bribes.

John Rogers: Have her tutor you.

John Rogers: But… I… her name's Britt. I tell her Britt.

John Rogers: Be nice. And she goes, okay.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay.

John Rogers: Be nice, Brett.

John Rogers: I, along with her, will grade.

Agnes Gholoonian: So, your exam…

John Rogers: Will have my eyes read every letter twice.

John Rogers: I'll read… I'll read your exam twice.

John Rogers: Okay. I have no life when it comes to grading.

John Rogers: So, I compare what she gives you, and I'll say, Britt, why did you give this student a C-?

John Rogers: And we've had some serious discrepancies.

John Rogers: ultimately, I win, means my grades. But, sometimes I want to hear what she has to say.

John Rogers: For evidence?

John Rogers: Neither Sebastian or myself will touch your final.

Agnes Gholoonian: Who reads our final first buffer?

John Rogers: Who is that? Who is it? Who is it? I won't even touch it.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay.

John Rogers: So it gives… puts a lot of pressure on us, too, by the way.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay.

Agnes Gholoonian: All right, thank you so much, Professor. I'm gonna… I'm working on getting an essay, too.

John Rogers: We'll work on it harder.

Agnes Gholoonian: I know, I know.

Agnes Gholoonian: Alright, thank you, have a good night.

Agnes Gholoonian: Bye.

Mireya Gonzalez: Professor, I'm having a hard time with present possessory, interests and future interests?

Mireya Gonzalez: that's kind of the questions I wanted to go over with you tomorrow, but hence that we're here, I'll do it today, so I don't waste your time tomorrow.

John Rogers: Call me tomorrow if you want. Hey, do you call me tomorrow?

Mireya Gonzalez: It's okay, that way I could, like, visually show you in the chat, too. So, I'm struggling when…

John Rogers: Let me just put it that way, I could.

Mireya Gonzalez: So, I just sent it in the chat.

Mireya Gonzalez: A would have a present interest, but…

Mireya Gonzalez: There's… what is it meant to be?

John Rogers: to send it to you? I don't got anything in the chat. Oh, shit, I sent it.

Mireya Gonzalez: You've been… who you've been private messaging?

Mireya Gonzalez: Here it is.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay.

Mireya Gonzalez: Did you get it?

John Rogers: I got it.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay, so I know A has a present interest. What I don't… which I think I'm… I don't know if I'm thinking about it too much, but…

Mireya Gonzalez: Where it says then to be, then to be's heirs. So, because that will happen in the future, even though B is technically, like, alive, I don't… I'm getting it confused whether it would be a present interest or a future interest, even though it's saying then to be for life, like, because technically, since they're alive.

Mireya Gonzalez: they have a present interest in it. So I'm… I'm confused whether I would use a present interest or a future interest when they're not… when it's not getting conveyed directly to them. Does that make sense?

John Rogers: Yeah, but here's the thing. Who has the property right now?

Mireya Gonzalez: A.

John Rogers: So, B doesn't have it right now.

Mireya Gonzalez: No.

John Rogers: So, B has no… present interest.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay, okay.

Mireya Gonzalez: See, when you say it like that, it was so simple, but I think I was just overthinking it.

Mireya Gonzalez: But it's whoever has the… If they don't have the…

John Rogers: Just think.

Mireya Gonzalez: They don't have it right now.

John Rogers: Who's got it now? Who's got it right now?

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay, I think that's where I was falling short. Okay, that is all, thank you. That's it? That's your only question? Well, I had more. I wanted just to go over, like.

Mireya Gonzalez: myself an essay with you to show you my thought process, to see if my thought process is going in the right direction, but I think that just… that will take a lot of time.

John Rogers: We can talk about it tomorrow.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay.

John Rogers: Some agree, give me a call. I'd love to talk to you.

Mireya Gonzalez: Aren't you going to Tijuana, though? What… when can I call?

John Rogers: Best thing to do is just text me, and I'll just let you know, and if you don't get a response from me, you probably will within an hour, because I'll be with my client tomorrow, and I'm not going to see her for more than an hour.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay.

John Rogers: There you go.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay, alright, thank you.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Anything else, guys? Or am I on… am I paroled, or what?

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, and that… What Miria just sent.

gevorg kulikyan: Maria. Is that… I hope I pronounced that correctly.

Mireya Gonzalez: Raya, but either way.

John Rogers: I, yeah, okay, that's fine. You can… you can pronounce it Mariah, that's fine.

gevorg kulikyan: So in this situation, one, is this a rule against perpetuities issue?

gevorg kulikyan: And is this a Sally's Rule issue? I think it was Sally's Rule, right?

John Rogers: sleep.

John Rogers: So, Shelly's case. And the answers to your question is yes and yes.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay, cool.

gevorg kulikyan: So, here, Would this be void?

John Rogers: Yes, it would.

gevorg kulikyan: And then O… it would be O to A and phi, simple absolute.

John Rogers: No, it would be… O to A so long as pocket care is used for residential purposes.

gevorg kulikyan: Oh.

John Rogers: then it would be a fee-simple determinable. It would be different if it said O2A comma But… if…

John Rogers: Black Acre is not used.

John Rogers: then the whole thing would be wiped out, and A would have a fee simple absolute.

John Rogers: But this is written differently.

John Rogers: Where it has that so long as.

gevorg kulikyan: It has both.

John Rogers: What do you mean? Oh yeah, the secondary… that's what I'm saying.

gevorg kulikyan: So, at the very end, it would be canceled out to…

John Rogers: residential purposes, period, but if would be all crossed out.

gevorg kulikyan: So if it's an O2A, but if Blackacre is used for residential purposes, that whole part goes away because the constraint.

John Rogers: Gone. Be able to get the…

gevorg kulikyan: Interest based off of that.

John Rogers: The rule against perpetuities would void all that out, so A would have a fee-simple absolute interest.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: But in this scenario, A would have a fee simple determinable, and O would have a possibility of reverter.

gevorg kulikyan: Cool. And then Shelly's case… It would just make this… Than to be…

gevorg kulikyan: Just then to be. Phi simple absolute, right?

John Rogers: And then RAP would void that.

gevorg kulikyan: Cool.

gevorg kulikyan: I like it.

John Rogers: See, property's fun!

gevorg kulikyan: No.

John Rogers: Yeah? Ain't fun. It's not fun.

gevorg kulikyan: Not at all.

Mireya Gonzalez: Yeah, it's my toughest class right now.

John Rogers: Is it? Okay, I told you it was hard. I told you all it's hard. It's not easy. Nobody likes it. Everybody hates property.

John Rogers: That's why I have so much job security, because they can't find anyone to teach this damn class.

John Rogers: Nobody wants to teach it!

John Rogers: But everybody wants to teach evidence. There's a line out the door to teach evidence.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: I think the name is pronounced Maria.

Mireya Gonzalez: It's actually Mirella.

John Rogers: Like I said, Maria.

Mireya Gonzalez: Miraya.

John Rogers: Mireya.

Mireya Gonzalez: There you go.

John Rogers: And did we talk about this, or was I making this up when you said something like, it's… it's…

John Rogers: I feel like we had this discussion, but I was wrong. It was, like, not Venezuelan London, but…

John Rogers: Something there, right? Northern… the northern part of South America.

Mireya Gonzalez: No. Mexican.

John Rogers: But… Yeah, we had this conversation before.

Mireya Gonzalez: Thank you.

John Rogers: Close enough, close enough.

John Rogers: Okay, yeah.

John Rogers: Okay, yeah, because I've had someone in my class that spelled it similar to that, except she was Russian, or Ukrainian.

John Rogers: And her name was Maria.

John Rogers: Anything else, guys?

Amir Akbari: Are you gonna email…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Are you gonna email about what time you're gonna do it on Saturday? 10.30, 11, 3?

John Rogers: I kinda wanna do… 10, 3rd…

Amir Akbari: The term video?

Amir Akbari: be… to eat 10.30, because I have… Save a lot.

Amir Akbari: 1.30, then Cream Pro, 4.30.

Amir Akbari: Really? Yeah. You have Simp Pro with.

Amir Akbari: Sifro Mancini.

John Rogers: Civ Pro.

Amir Akbari: No, it's probably Barrett.

John Rogers: Huh.

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: Okay, I got a message.

John Rogers: You gotta take the Barrett. You ready?

John Rogers: You tell that man on Saturday.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: That you've heard.

John Rogers: That he's a world… Solitaire.

John Rogers: Champion.

John Rogers: Can you let me know.

John Rogers: Woody snacks.

Amir Akbari: Okay.

Amir Akbari: I agree.

John Rogers: World champion.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, sure.

John Rogers: Anything else, or am I paroled for the night?

gevorg kulikyan: Thank you, Professor.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Thank you, Professor. Have a good night.

John Rogers: Alright, guys.

John Rogers: See ya.
