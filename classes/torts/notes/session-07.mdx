description: "Session 7"

## I. The General Standard of Care (Breach)

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule

- **Prima Facie Element:** To prove negligence, the plaintiff must show **Breach**, which is defined as **conduct falling below the standard of care of a reasonable, prudent person under the circumstances**.
  - This mantra must be applied specifically to the facts (e.g., "reasonable prudent driver," "reasonable prudent doctor") [cite: 128-130].
  - Fluidity in stating this rule is essential for bar exam success [cite: 179-181].

### 2. Key Cases

- **Davison v. Snohomish County**
  - **Facts:** Plaintiffs were injured when their car broke through a wooden guardrail on a bridge. The county had not built the rail strong enough to withstand the impact.
  - **Holding/Rule:** The court found no negligence as a matter of law. Building guardrails strong enough to stop cars at high speeds creates a prohibitive cost burden relative to the risk [cite: 143-145]. The construction did not fall below the standard of care under the circumstances (financial feasibility is a circumstance).

### 3. Nuance & Policy

- **JNOV (Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict):** A motion asking the judge to overrule the jury's verdict because, as a matter of law, the winning party failed to prove their case. It is a high threshold [cite: 161-163].

## II. The Learned Hand Formula (Calculus of Risk)

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule

- Determination of whether conduct is reasonable is done by balancing risks against the cost of prevention. This is known as the **Learned Hand Formula**.
- **The Formula:** $B < P \times L$
  - **P:** The **Probability** that the risk of harm will manifest (accident occurring).
  - **L:** The **Gravity of Harm** (damages) that results if the accident occurs.
  - **B:** The **Burden/Cost** of adequate precautions (remedial measures) to prevent the harm.
- **Application:** If the Cost of Precautions ($B$) is **less than** the Probability multiplied by the Gravity of Harm ($P \times L$), the failure to take that precaution is a **Breach** [cite: 315, 319-320].

### 2. Key Cases

- **United States v. Carroll Towing Co.**
  - **Facts:** A barge broke loose; the question was whether the bargee (attendant) should have been on board.
  - **Holding/Rule:** Judge Learned Hand introduced the balancing test to determine negligence.

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples

- **The Jet Ski/Snowmobile Example:**
  - **Scenario:** A "dead man's switch" (safety feature that stops the engine if the rider falls off) costs $500 ($B$). The probability of a rider falling and the vehicle hitting someone is 1% ($P$). The average damage caused by a runaway vehicle is $100,000 ($L$) [cite: 217, 223, 227-229].
  - **Calculation:** $P \times L$ = $1,000 (1% of 100k). $B$=$500.
  - **Outcome:** Since $500 < 1,000$, the failure to install the switch is a breach of duty.
- **Disposable Lighter:**
  - **Scenario:** A safety latch costs 5 cents. The risk of a lighter igniting in a pocket is 1%, causing \$10,000 in car fire damages.
  - **Outcome:** 5 cents \< $100 ($10k \\times 1%). Failure to install is a breach [cite: 331-335].

### 4. Nuance & Policy

- This formula is primarily used in cases with an **economic aspect**, such as **product liability** (design defects), rather than everyday negligence like driving too fast or leaving a golf club out.

## III. The Objective Standard & Physical/Mental Characteristics

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule

- **Objective Standard:** Tort law uses an objective standard. We compare the defendant's conduct to a "reasonable, prudent person," not to what the defendant _thought_ was reasonable (Subjective Standard) [cite: 401-404, 412].
- **Physical Characteristics:** The physical characteristics of the defendant (e.g., blindness, physical disability) **ARE** taken into account. The standard becomes "a reasonable person with the same physical disability under the circumstances".
- **Mental Illness:** Mental illness is **NOT** taken into account. A mentally ill person is held to the standard of a reasonable person _without_ mental illness.
  - _Exception:_ If a person is adjudicated insane (judicially determined), they may be institutionalized, but generally, for civil liability, mental illness is no defense.

### 2. Key Cases

- **Vaughan v. Menlove** (1837)
  - **Facts:** Defendant stacked hay in a way that caused it to ignite and burn neighbor's cottages. Defendant argued he acted in "good faith" and did his best given his limited intelligence.
  - **Holding/Rule:** The court rejected the "good faith" argument. The standard is objective: what a reasonable, prudent farmer would have done, not what the specific defendant believed was right.
- **Delair v. McAdoo**
  - **Facts:** Defendant drove on tires so worn the fabric was showing and caused a blowout/accident. Defendant claimed he didn't know the tires were dangerous.
  - **Holding/Rule:** Drivers are charged with **constructive knowledge**. A driver is deemed to know what a reasonable person would know (that bald tires are dangerous), regardless of actual knowledge.
- **Roberts v. State of Louisiana**
  - **Facts:** A blind man bumped into the plaintiff at a concession stand. He was not using his cane at that specific moment [cite: 541-543].
  - **Holding/Rule:** A disabled person is not held to the standard of a sighting person, but to the standard of a **reasonable blind person** under the circumstances.
- **Breunig v. American Family Insurance Co.**
  - **Facts:** Driver believed she could fly (Batman delusion) and drove into a truck.
  - **Holding/Rule:** Mental illness is not an exception. She was held to the objective reasonable person standard.

### 3. Nuance & Policy

- **Public Safety Policy:** We do not allow mental illness as a defense because innocent victims need compensation, and it incentivizes guardians to care for the mentally ill [cite: 650-652].

## IV. The Emergency Doctrine

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule

- If a defendant is confronted with a sudden emergency (not of their own making), their conduct is compared to a **reasonable, prudent person under those specific emergency circumstances**.
- Conduct that might be negligent ordinarily (e.g., jumping out of a moving car) may be reasonable under life-threatening circumstances.

### 2. Key Cases

- **Cordas v. Peerless Transportation Co.**
  - **Facts:** A taxi driver had a gun pointed at him by a thief. He jumped out of the moving cab to escape; the unmanned cab hit pedestrians [cite: 501-503].
  - **Holding/Rule:** The driver was **not liable**. Under the circumstances (gun pointed at head), his conduct did not fall below the standard of care.

## V. Minors

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule

- **General Rule:** A minor is compared to a **reasonable minor of like age, intelligence, and experience** under the circumstances.
- **Exception (Adult Activity):** If the minor is engaged in an **adult activity** (e.g., driving a car, operating a motor vehicle), they are held to the standard of a **reasonable, prudent adult**.

### 2. Key Cases

- **Robinson v. Lindsay**
  - **Facts:** A 13-year-old was driving a snowmobile and severed the plaintiff's thumb [cite: 577-579].
  - **Holding/Rule:** Because operating a snowmobile is an adult activity, the minor is held to the adult standard of care.

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples

- **Frisbee vs. Driving:** If a 13-year-old throws a frisbee and hits someone, use the "like age/experience" standard. If they are driving a car or hunting, use the "reasonable adult" standard [cite: 610-611].

---

## VI. Custom and Usage

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule

- **Rule:** Evidence of industry custom or practice is **admissible** as evidence of what a reasonable person would do, but it is **not conclusive** [cite: 851-852, 882].
- A jury can find that an entire industry's custom is negligent if it lags behind reasonable safety standards.

### 2. Key Cases

- **Trimarco v. Klein**
  - **Facts:** Plaintiff was injured when a glass shower door shattered. Plaintiff argued the custom was to use safety glass; landlord argued custom was only to replace broken glass with safety glass, not retrofit existing ones [cite: 826-830].
  - **Holding/Rule:** Custom is relevant evidence but not dispositive. A landlord (or industry) cannot shield themselves solely by saying "everyone else does it this way" if the practice itself is unsafe.

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples

- **Auto Industry:** In the 1950s, no manufacturers installed seatbelts. If a manufacturer was sued, they couldn't simply argue "nobody else does it" as a complete defense if the technology was available and reasonable [cite: 866-871].

## VII. Professionals (Malpractice)

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule

- **Standard of Care:** A professional is held to the standard of an **ordinary member of the profession** in good standing under the circumstances.
- **No "Novice" Defense:** The standard is objective. It does not adjust for lack of experience. A brand new lawyer/doctor is held to the same standard as a reasonable, prudent lawyer/doctor.
- **Specialists:** If a professional is **Board Certified** or a specialist, they are held to the higher standard of a reasonable **specialist** in that field.
- **Expert Testimony:** Because professional standards are often beyond the knowledge of lay jurors, **expert testimony** is generally required to establish the standard of care and breach.

### 2. Key Cases

- **Heath v. Swift Wings, Inc.**
  - **Facts:** A pilot crashed. The trial court instructed the jury to consider the pilot's specific training and experience.
  - **Holding/Rule:** Incorrect instruction. The standard is a reasonable, prudent pilot, not a pilot with _this defendant's_ specific experience. Experience is not a defense.
- **Hodges v. Carter**
  - **Facts:** Lawyers served process by mail (customary practice) rather than personal service (statutory requirement), leading to dismissal of the client's case [cite: 1088-1090].
  - **Holding/Rule:** Professionals are not liable for mere errors in judgment if they acted in accordance with professional custom. Since the lawyers followed the accepted custom, they were not liable.
- **Boyce v. Brown**
  - **Facts:** Doctor used a metal screw for a fracture. Years later, he treated pain with tape/support but did not X-ray. Another doctor later X-rayed and found necrosis [cite: 1114-1123].
  - **Holding/Rule:** To prove malpractice, the plaintiff needs expert testimony stating the defendant _breached_ the standard. The second doctor would not testify that the standard _required_ an X-ray at that time (1936), only that _he_ would have done it. Personal opinion is not the standard of care.

### 3. Nuance & Policy

- **Licensed Activity Only:** The professional standard only applies when the actor is engaged in their profession. A cardiologist driving a car is held to the standard of a reasonable driver, not a reasonable cardiologist [cite: 975-979].

---

## VIII. Informed Consent

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule

- **Traditional Rule (Physician-Focused):** Did the doctor disclose what a reasonable _doctor_ would disclose?.
- **Modern Rule (Patient-Focused):** The standard is **what a reasonable patient would want to know** regarding the material risks and consequences before consenting to treatment.

### 2. Key Cases

- **Scott v. Bradford** (Oklahoma Case)
  - **Facts:** Plaintiff had a hysterectomy causing incontinence. She claimed she wasn't told of the risks/alternatives.
  - **Holding/Rule:** Adopted the patient-focused standard. It is irrelevant what the doctor thought was appropriate to tell; the focus is on the patient's right to know material risks to make an informed decision [cite: 1247-1248].

## IX. Defenses to Intentional Torts (Review)

### 1. Public vs. Private Necessity

- **Public Necessity:** Where an act is for the **public good** (e.g., destroying a building to stop a fire spreading to the city). The defense is **absolute**, and the actor does not have to pay for damages [cite: 1270-1271].
- **Private Necessity:** Where a defendant acts to save their own interest/property (e.g., tying a ship to a dock during a storm). The actor is relieved of the technical tort of trespass but **must pay for actual damages** caused.
