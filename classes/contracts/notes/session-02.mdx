# Contracts - Session 02 Class Notes

## I. Governing Law for Contracts

### A. General Rule
- **Common law** governs all contracts
- **Exception**: Sales of goods are governed by the **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)**

### B. Key Definitions

#### 1. Agreement vs. Contract
- **Agreement**: Not necessarily a contract
- **Contract**: An **enforceable** agreement

#### 2. Agreement (Restatement Second of Contracts)
- A **manifestation of mutual assent**
- Sufficiently definite to conclude a bargain
- Parties need only agree on **essential terms**, not all terms

#### 3. Contract Defined
- **Restatement Second § 1**: A contract is a **set of promises** (at least two) that the law will enforce
- A promise or set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, or the performance of which the law recognizes as a duty

#### 4. Simple Definition of Contract
- **Offer + Acceptance + Consideration + Lack of Defenses**
- This comprehensive definition helps ensure all issues are spotted on exams

## II. Mutual Assent and Objective Theory of Contract

### A. Mutual Assent
- Parties must reach an agreement
- Required for contract formation

### B. Objective Theory of Contract
- Courts focus on **outward manifestation** of parties' intent
- What parties thought in their minds is irrelevant
- **Test**: What would a reasonable person in the eyes of the opposing party conclude?

### C. Key Case: *Lucy v. Zehmer*
- Prime example of objective theory
- Outward manifestation controls over internal thoughts
- Court looks at what parties said and did, not what they were thinking
- Even drinking/joking may not negate contract if objective manifestations show intent

### D. Intent - Most Important Aspect
- Intent is the most important element in contract law (like in criminal law)
- Did parties intend to be serious or joking?

## III. UCC - Sales of Goods

### A. Definition of "Sale" (UCC § 2-106(1))
- A sale is a contract in which **title to goods passes**
- From the seller to the buyer
- For a price

### B. Definition of "Goods" (UCC § 2-105(1))
- **All things movable** at the time they are identified as the goods to be sold under the contract
- Must be **tangible and movable**

### C. Goods Associated with Real Estate

#### 1. Growing Crops and Timber (UCC § 2-107(1))
- **Growing crops** - always considered goods (UCC applies)
- **Timber to be cut** - always considered goods (UCC applies)
- **No matter who cuts them**

#### 2. Fixtures (UCC § 2-107(2))
- **Rule**: If removed **without material harm** to the land AND **severed by the seller**, UCC applies
- **General principle**: Anything affixed to land is part of the land
  - Even if attached by one pipe or one screw
  - Once affixed = not goods until properly severed

#### 3. Important Note
- Light bulbs screwed into sockets connected to land = part of land
- Cannot be removed when selling home
- Barbecue affixed to land/wall = part of land, not goods

## IV. Mixed/Hybrid Contracts

### A. Severability Test
- Contracts are **severable** if promises are:
  1. **Independent** AND
  2. **Apportionable**

#### 1. Independent
- Promises are independent if parties' intent evidences they would have contracted for the promises separately
- **Example**: Hire painter for $1,000 to paint living room by March 1, and $800 to paint dining room by March 15
- Focuses on whether obligations are separate

#### 2. Apportionable
- The consideration can be split proportionally for partial performance
- **Example**: Pool cleaning for $50/month for whole year - can sever into individual months
- Focuses on whether consideration can be divided

### B. When Not Severable
- Apply **predominant purpose test**
- **Example**: Domino's pizza delivery - cannot separate price for delivery vs. pizza
- Apply law governing the predominant purpose of the contract

## V. Types of Contracts - Formation

### A. Express Contracts
- A contract in which the **offer, acceptance, AND consideration** are **ALL expressly stated** by the parties
- Can be stated **orally OR in writing**
- **Common mistake**: Express does NOT mean written
- **Example**: *Lucy v. Zehmer* - everything said and wrote was expressed

### B. Implied-in-Fact Contracts
- A contract in which the offer, acceptance, OR consideration is evidenced by the **parties' actions rather than words**

### C. Implied-in-Law Contracts (Quasi-Contracts)

#### 1. Key Point: NOT A CONTRACT
- **First rule**: An implied-in-law contract is **NOT a contract**
- It is an **equitable remedy** created by the courts

#### 2. Three Elements Required:
1. The **moving party** (plaintiff) had an **expectation of receiving a benefit** in return for performance
   - Expectation must be **reasonable** (objective standard)
2. The moving party had, in fact, **conferred a benefit**
3. It would be **unjust** to allow the other party to **retain that benefit without compensation**
   - Called **unjust enrichment**

#### 3. Important Notes
- Equitable remedy, not legal remedy
- Contract formation defenses do not apply (because it's not a contract)
- **Statute of Frauds is NOT a defense** to quasi-contract
- **Application**: Family law - innocent spouse treated as having quasi community property rights

## VI. Offer

### A. Definition
- An **offer** is an **intent to be bound** by **certain definite terms** which are **communicated to the offeree**

### B. Three Key Elements

#### 1. Intent
- **Present intent** to be bound (not future intent)
- "Here and now" - not "I will at some point"
- Judged by **objective standard** of contract law
- Most important element - offer literally "is an intent"

#### 2. Certain Definite Terms

##### a. Common Law
- **Material terms** are required
- Material terms = those terms necessary for the court to:
  - Determine if there was a breach, AND
  - Create a remedy if breach occurred

##### b. UCC
- Only **two requirements**:
  1. **Intent to be bound**
  2. **Quantity**
- Everything else supplied by **UCC gap fillers**

#### 3. Communicated to Offeree
- The offeree must **receive and understand** the offer

## VII. UCC Gap Filler Provisions

### A. General Rule
- Gap fillers apply when there is **both intent and quantity**
- UCC is **pro-contract enforcement**
- Designed to make it easier for parties to form valid contracts

### B. Price (UCC § 2-305)

#### 1. General Rule (§ 2-305(1))
- Parties can conclude contract even though price is not settled
- Price = **reasonable price at time of delivery**

#### 2. Three Scenarios for Reasonable Price
- **(A)** Nothing is said about price
- **(B)** Price left to be agreed by parties, and they fail to agree
- **(C)** Price fixed in terms of agreed market/standard or set by third party/agency
  - **Example**: Crude oil at market price at time of delivery

#### 3. Good Faith Requirement (§ 2-305(2))
- Price fixed by seller or buyer means price fixed in **good faith**
- Every agreement requires **good faith and fair dealing**
- Cannot hide known defects or material information

#### 4. No Fault Provision (§ 2-305(3))
- When price left to be fixed fails through **fault of no party**
- Other party may:
  - Treat contract as canceled, OR
  - Fix a reasonable price

#### 5. Conditional Intent (§ 2-305(4))
- **TESTED PROVISION**
- If parties intend **NOT to be bound unless** price is fixed or agreed
- And price is not fixed or agreed
- **Result**: There is **NO contract**
- "Agreement to agree" is not enforceable
- The word "**unless**" is key

### C. Place of Delivery (UCC § 2-308)

#### 1. General Rule (§ 2-308(a))
- Unless otherwise agreed, place of delivery = **seller's place of business**
- If no place of business, then **seller's residence**

#### 2. Identified Goods (§ 2-308(b))
- For identified goods which parties know are at another location at time of contracting
- **That location** is the place of delivery
- **Example**: Yacht in Florida - delivery must occur in Florida, not seller's residence

### D. Time of Delivery (UCC § 2-309)

#### 1. General Rule (§ 2-309(1))
- Time for shipment, delivery, or other action if not agreed = **reasonable time**
- **Example**: Goods from US = perhaps 30 days reasonable
- **Example**: Goods from China through customs = perhaps 3 months reasonable

#### 2. Successive Performances (§ 2-309(2))
- Contract for successive performances but indefinite in duration
- Valid for reasonable time
- May be terminated at any time by either party
- **Example**: Monthly water delivery with no end date

### E. Time of Payment (UCC § 2-310)
- Unless otherwise agreed, payment due at **time and place buyer receives goods**
- Even if place of shipment is place of delivery
- **Simple rule**: Get the goods = pay at that time

## VIII. Types of Contracts - Acceptance

### A. Bilateral Contracts
- **Mutual promises are exchanged**
- Promise to promise
- A promises to B, B promises to A
- **Example**: "I promise to sell you my Mustang for $30,000" + "You promise to buy my Mustang for $30,000"
- Contract formed upon exchange of promises

### B. Unilateral Contracts

#### 1. Definition
- Traditional unilateral contract = offeror requests **performance rather than a promise**
- Offeror promises to pay upon **completion** of requested act
- "I don't want your promise, I want your performance"

#### 2. Key Rule
- **Contract formed ONLY upon completion of performance**
- **NOT before completion**
- No contract exists until act is fully completed
- **Example**: "I will pay you $10 if you walk across Brooklyn Bridge Saturday at noon"
  - Saying "I promise to walk" = no contract
  - Walking halfway = no contract
  - Arriving at 12:02pm = no contract (too late)
  - Completing walk at proper time = contract formed

#### 3. Timing Issues
- Master of offer sets terms
- Must complete performance exactly as specified
- Once completed, contract exists and offeror owes payment

## IX. Exam Tips

### A. Issue Spotting
- Issue spotting = approximately 25-30% of grade
- Analysis = 50-60% of grade
- Conclusion = minimal importance

### B. Definitions
- **Never get definitions wrong**
- Especially problematic on take-home exams
- Wrong definition = entire analysis will be wrong
- Use commercial outlines and class notes

### C. Formatting Tips
- **Underline and bold key phrases**
  - Intent, certain definite terms, communicated, etc.
- Helps bar graders see important points
- Makes key elements stand out

### D. UCC Code Sections
- **Do NOT memorize UCC section numbers**
- **Never put wrong number on exam** - graders will penalize
- Exception: UCC § 2-207 (Battle of Forms) commonly referenced
- Better to describe provision than risk wrong number

### E. Study Approach
- Understand concepts, don't just memorize
- Make your own outlines starting now
- Read assigned cases before each session
- Be prepared to brief cases when called upon

## X. Important Reminders

### A. Case Reading
- Read all assigned cases through end of each session
- Be ready to brief cases at any time
- *Lucy v. Zehmer* is critical - will definitely appear on final

### B. Bar Preparation
- Start building study habits now
- Practice is essential
- Commercial outlines helpful but make your own
- Time management crucial on bar exam (approximately 1 hour per essay)

### C. Study Tips
- Intent of parties = most important aspect
- Objective theory applies throughout
- Court enforces parties' intent when clear
- Gap fillers only apply when terms are missing
