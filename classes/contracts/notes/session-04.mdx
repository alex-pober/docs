# Session 04: Offers and Contract Formation

## Overview
This session covered fundamental principles of offer and acceptance in contract law, including:
- Definition and elements of a valid offer
- Objective theory of contracts
- Advertisements as offers vs. invitations to negotiate
- Incapacity and intoxication defenses
- Intent to contract and illusory promises
- Price quotations and quantity requirements

---

## I. Definition of Contract and Offers

### A. Definition of Contract
**Contract**: A promise or set of promises for the breach of which the law provides a remedy, or the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty.

### B. Definition of an Offer
**Offer**: A definite expression of willingness to enter into a bargain made so that another person is justified in understanding that their assent will conclude the deal.

#### Elements of a Valid Offer:
1. **Definite and certain terms** communicated to the offeree
2. **Present willingness** to enter into a bargain
3. **Intent to be bound** presently (not future intent)
4. Made such that the offeree need only say "I accept" to form a contract

**Key Point**: If the offeree must say more than "I accept," it is likely NOT an offer—it may be an invitation to negotiate.

### C. Present Intent to Be Bound
- The offeror must have **present intent** to be bound by certain definite terms
- Time of delivery is irrelevant—what matters is present intent to contract
- **Example**: "I will sell you my car right now for $5,000, but I'll deliver it to you next month" = valid offer
- **Counterexample**: "I will be selling my car next month for $5,000" = NOT an offer (future intent)

---

## II. Objective Theory of Contracts

### A. Objective vs. Subjective Intent
**Rule**: Contracts are measured by **objective** standards, not subjective intent.

**Test**: What would a reasonable person in the offeree's position believe based on the offeror's words and conduct?

### B. Application to Capacity Issues

#### Intoxication
- Intoxication does **not automatically** invalidate an offer
- Analysis focuses on what the **offeree knew or should have known** about the offeror's impaired state
- If the offeree knows or has reason to know the offeror lacks capacity, the offer may not be enforceable

**Example**: Ben tells a friend at a party while tipsy, "I'll sell you my car for $1,000." The friend knows Ben has been drinking heavily but believes he understands what he's saying.
- **Analysis**: No enforceable contract because the friend knew or had reason to know Ben was impaired
- Even though intoxication doesn't automatically invalidate offers, the friend's knowledge of the impairment is determinative
- The question is: Could a reasonable person in the friend's position accept this as a valid offer knowing Ben had been "drinking heavily"?

#### Statements Made in Frustration/Anger
- Offers made in anger are **not automatically void**
- Subject to objective theory of contracts
- **Test**: What would a reasonable person interpret the statement to mean?

**Example**: Sam, after a frustrating day, exclaims to his coworker, "I'll sell you my house for $1."
- Not automatically void merely because made in frustration
- Must analyze whether a reasonable person would interpret this as a serious offer
- Context matters: relationship between parties, circumstances, reasonableness of terms

### C. Lucy v. Zehmer Reference
- Parties were drinking in a bar/restaurant
- Court examined totality of circumstances: 40 minutes of negotiation, exchanging notes, rewriting terms
- Despite some drinking, court found offeror was of sound mind
- Demonstrates that intoxication alone doesn't invalidate contracts—must look at all circumstances

---

## III. Advertisements as Offers

### A. General Rule
**General Rule**: Advertisements are typically **invitations to negotiate**, NOT offers.

**Exception**: An advertisement MAY be an offer if it meets the definition of an offer (definite and certain terms).

### B. Requirements for Advertisement to Be an Offer

#### Under the UCC (Sale of Goods)
**Essential Term**: **QUANTITY** is the only required certain definite term.
- Price is NOT required (gap fillers can apply)
- Time of delivery is NOT required
- If quantity is missing or uncertain, the advertisement FAILS as an offer

#### Classic Examples

**Example 1: Valid Offer**
Advertisement states: "Brand new laptops, $200 each. First come, first served. Limited to 3 units."
- **Analysis**: This IS an offer because:
  - Clear quantity: 3 units
  - Clear price: $200 each
  - Clear offerees: first three people
  - Definite terms—nothing left to negotiate
  - Offeree need only walk in with $200 and say "I accept"

**Example 2: NOT an Offer**
Advertisement states: "Brand new laptops, prices as listed."
- **Analysis**: NOT an offer because:
  - Quantity is unclear (1 unit? 1,000 units? 5 million?)
  - Without quantity, fails as an offer
  - General rule: advertisements are invitations to negotiate

**Example 3: Specific Item Advertisement**
LA Times ad: "Mustang, 2025, blue, VIN number 12345, $55,000. Sale this Saturday."
- **Analysis**: This IS an offer because:
  - VIN number makes it specific (quantity = 1 specific car)
  - Clear price and terms
  - If car is available, dealer must sell it

### C. **Lefkowitz v. Great Minneapolis Surplus Store** (Leading Case)

**Facts**: Defendant published newspaper announcement: "Saturday, 9 a.m. sharp. 3 brand new fur coats worth to $100. First come, first served. $1 each."

Mr. Morris Lefkowitz arrived with dollar in hand but was told offer was only for ladies, not gentlemen.

**Holding**: Contract was formed.

**Reasoning**:
- Advertisement was specific and left nothing open for negotiation
- Plaintiff fulfilled all terms
- Clear quantity (3 coats)
- Clear price ($1 each)
- Clear acceptance method (first come, first served)

---

## IV. Case Law: **Leonard v. PepsiCo, Inc.** (Harrier Jet Case)

### Facts
- Pepsi ran commercial showing items available for Pepsi points
- Commercial showed Harrier jet landing at school with "7 million Pepsi points" displayed
- Leonard raised ~$700,000, bought Pepsi points to reach 7 million
- Demanded Harrier jet
- Pepsi refused

### Holding
No contract formed; commercial was not an offer.

### Reasoning

1. **Not Sufficiently Definite**
   - Commercial reserved details to separate catalog
   - No mention of steps required to accept
   - No "first come, first served" or quantity limitation

2. **Distinguished from Lefkowitz**
   - Lefkowitz had specific, clear terms
   - Absence of limiting words like "first come, first served" renders offer indefinite
   - No clear acceptance mechanism

3. **Objective Theory Applied**
   - "Tongue-in-cheek attitude" of commercial
   - No reasonable person would conclude soft drink company giving away fighter planes
   - Context matters: military jet worth millions vs. Pepsi points value

4. **Statute of Frauds** (mentioned but not primary basis)
   - Court noted no writing between parties
   - Though commercial had written words on screen, not sufficient for this type of contract

**Key Takeaway**: Advertisements for sale of goods are generally NOT offers unless they contain definite, specific terms including quantity and clear acceptance mechanism.

---

## V. Incapacity Defenses

### A. General Rule
Valid capacity defenses can override objective theory of contracts.

### B. Minors
- Minor entering into contract can generally invalidate it
- Doesn't matter that objective theory would support contract formation
- Example: Minor buying real estate—likely unenforceable if minor wishes to void

### C. Intoxication (Detailed Analysis)

**Two-Part Test**:
1. Was the person intoxicated?
2. Did the other party know or have reason to know of the intoxication?

**Visibly Intoxicated Example**:
Emily is visibly intoxicated at a bar and slurs, "I'll sell you my Rolex for $100 right now." Chris knows Emily is too drunk to understand but immediately accepts.

**Analysis**:
- NOT enforceable
- Test: What should a **reasonable person in Chris's position** know?
- Chris knew or should have known Emily lacked capacity
- Knowledge element is measured objectively: "knew or should have known"

**Comparison to Consent in Other Contexts**:
- Similar to consent issues in criminal law (e.g., sexual assault)
- If you know or should know someone is heavily intoxicated, cannot reasonably rely on their consent/assent
- Courts will not enforce contracts where one party knew or should have known of impairment

---

## VI. Price Quotations and Quantity Requirements

### A. **Fairmount Glass Works v. Crunden-Martin** (Leading Case)

**Facts**:
- Crunden-Martin requested quote by telegram for mason jars
- Fairmount replied with "offer for immediate acceptance" including detailed price and shipment info
- Crunden-Martin accepted
- Fairmount refused to fill order, claiming no contract formed

**Issue**: Was Fairmount's quotation an offer or mere price quote?

**Holding**: Offer was made; contract formed.

**Reasoning**:
1. **Response to Inquiry**: Communication came in response to plaintiff's specific inquiry
   - **Key Principle**: When responding to an inquiry, communication is MORE LIKELY to be an offer

2. **Language of Commitment**: "For immediate acceptance" = language of commitment

3. **Detailed Terms Including Quantity**: 10 carloads = 1,000 gross
   - Quantity of "10 carloads" was incorporated by implication from plaintiff's inquiry
   - Court rejected defendant's argument that quantity was too indefinite
   - "10 carloads" = trade talk equivalent to 1,000 gross

**Key Takeaway**: Responses to inquiries with specific terms and language of commitment are more likely to constitute offers.

### B. Quantity Must Be Clear and Definite

**Rule**: Quantity cannot be a range; must be a specific, certain number.

#### **Moulton v. Kershaw** (1884)

**Facts**:
Defendant wrote: "In consequence of a rupture in the salt trade, we are authorized to offer Michigan fine salt in full carload lots of 80 to 95 barrels, delivered at your city at $85 per barrel. At this price it is a bargain. Shall be pleased to receive your order."

Plaintiff responded: "You may ship me 2,000 barrels Michigan fine salt as offered in your letter."

**Issue**: Was there a contract?

**Holding**: No contract.

**Reasoning**:
- Failure to specify quantity prevents communication from being an offer
- "80 to 95 barrels" is a RANGE, not a specific quantity
- Plaintiff's response of "2,000 barrels" doesn't cure defect—must look at whether OFFER had certain quantity
- No certain quantity in offer = no valid offer = no contract

**Modern Application**:
- UCC still requires fixed quantity (gap fillers do NOT apply to quantity)
- Court cannot pick a number from a range (10 laptops to 5 million laptops?)
- Becomes unenforceable promise

#### Problem: Millet Seed (1915 Case)

**Facts**: Farmer sent letter to multiple seed dealers: "I have 1,800 bushels of millet seed, of which I am mailing you a sample. This millet is re-cleaned and was grown on sod and is good seed. I want $2.25 per 100 weight for this seed FOB."

Plaintiff answered: "I accept your offer."

**Issue**: Was there a contract?

**Holding**: No contract.

**Reasoning**:
1. **Could Be Argued as Offer**:
   - Appears directed to one individual
   - States quantity (1,800 bushels) and quality
   - "Want" appears equivalent to an offer

2. **Court's Conclusion**:
   - Language "might be used in a circular letter" (mass mailing)
   - Treated as advertisement to solicit offers
   - Plaintiff's acceptance didn't specify quantity desired
   - No meeting of the minds on quantity

**Key Issue**: Even though offeror stated quantity, offeree's acceptance didn't specify how much they wanted to purchase.

---

## VII. Gap Fillers Under the UCC

### A. General Rule
Gap fillers apply when parties are **silent** on a term (e.g., price, time of delivery).

**UCC § 2-305**: If parties say nothing about price, court will supply reasonable price.

### B. Exception: Agree to Agree
**Rule**: If parties say "we will agree on price later," gap fillers do NOT apply.

**Reasoning**: Court will not substitute its judgment when parties explicitly reserved a term for future agreement.

**Example**: "I'll sell you my oil, but we'll agree on a price later."
- NO contract
- One essential term parties agreed on is missing
- Court won't use gap fillers because parties didn't leave it silent—they specifically said they'd agree later
- This is critical when dealing with high-value commodities (millions of gallons of oil, billions of dollars)

### C. What Gap Fillers Cover
Gap fillers apply ONLY to UCC (sale of goods):
- **Price**: If silent, reasonable price
- **Time of delivery**: If silent, reasonable time
- **Place of delivery**: If silent, seller's place of business
- **Time of payment**: If silent, due at time of delivery

### D. What Gap Fillers Do NOT Cover
**QUANTITY**: Gap fillers do NOT apply to quantity.
- If quantity not stated, offer is DEAD
- Exception: Output and requirements contracts (discussed below)

---

## VIII. Output and Requirements Contracts (Exception to Quantity Rule)

### A. General Rule
Quantity must be specified in a valid offer EXCEPT for output and requirements contracts.

### B. Output Contracts
**Definition**: Seller agrees to sell ALL output they produce.

**Example**: Ford Motor Company contracts with leather manufacturer: "All the leather you output this year, we'll buy all of it."
- Enforceable under UCC
- Even though specific quantity not mentioned
- Subject to reasonableness standard

### C. Requirements Contracts
**Definition**: Buyer agrees to buy ALL requirements from seller.

**Example**: Leather company to Ford: "All the leather Ford requires for 2025, we will produce."
- Enforceable even though quantity not mentioned
- Subject to reasonableness

### D. Reasonableness Limitation
**Key Limitation**: Subject to reason—cannot dramatically deviate from normal course of business.

**Example**: If Ford usually sells 500,000 units per year:
- Ford CANNOT sue saying "I wanted 5 million this year and you failed to produce"
- Must be reasonable based on past dealings and industry standards
- Prevents abuse of output/requirements contracts

---

## IX. Illusory Promises

### A. Definition
**Illusory Promise**: A promise that is not really a promise; appears to be a commitment but contains language that negates the obligation.

**Rule**: An illusory promise is NOT a promise and does NOT create a contract.

### B. **Larry Flynt / Hustler Magazine Example** (2017)

**Facts**:
- Full-page ad in Washington Post offering $10 million reward for information leading to impeachment and removal of Donald Trump
- Bottom of ad stated: "I will pay the reward if I am willing to publish the information provided."

**Analysis**:
- Initial expression appears to be a commitment ($10 million reward)
- Conditional language ELIMINATES the commitment
- "If I am willing to publish" = condition dependent entirely on offeror's discretion
- This is NOT a promise

**Comparison**: "I will sell you my home if I want to."
- Not a valid offer
- Condition is: maybe I'll do it, maybe I won't—I'll decide later
- No commitment = no promise = no offer

---

## X. Letters of Intent and Binding Provisions

### A. **Logan v. D.W. Silvers** (2007)

**Facts**:
- Letter of intent for purchase/sale of shopping mall at $5.28 million
- Letter stated: "This letter of intent is NOT a binding agreement... Only a fully executed purchase and sale agreement shall constitute a binding transaction."
- HOWEVER, letter also included: "Seller agrees to provide required due diligence documents and NOT to seek nor enter into a letter of intent or purchase agreement with any third party for 60 days."
- Seller accepted offer from third party during 60-day period

**Issue**: Is seller in breach of contract?

**Holding**: Yes, breach of the non-solicitation provision.

**Reasoning**:
1. **Overall Agreement Not Binding**: Letter of intent as a whole was not an enforceable purchase contract
2. **Specific Provisions Were Binding**: Letter contained THREE binding provisions:
   - Seller's promise to provide due diligence materials
   - Seller's promise to comply with non-solicitation provision (NOT sell to others for 60 days)
   - Purchaser's promise to review due diligence in good faith
3. **Breach of Specific Promise**: Seller breached the non-solicitation provision by selling to third party

**Key Takeaway**: Even if overall agreement is unenforceable, specific promises within the agreement may be binding and enforceable. Courts will hold parties to specific commitments even in preliminary agreements.

## XI. Case Law: **Sullivan v. O'Connor** (Nose Job Case)

### Facts
- Plastic surgeon performed nose job
- Plaintiff's nose ended up "nub-like" configuration that could not be improved by further surgery
- Jury found NO negligence but awarded damages for breach of contract
- Jury included pain and suffering damages

### Court's Analysis

#### A. Policy Concerns with Medical Contract Claims
**Court's Skepticism**:
1. Doctors can seldom promise specific results in good faith
2. Doctor statements are usually opinions, not guarantees
3. Patients may transform statements into firm promises in their minds
4. Risk: disappointed patients will testify to sympathetic juries claiming breach of contract

**Concern**: If contract theory too easy, patients will bypass difficult negligence claims and sue for breach of contract instead.

#### B. Countervailing Policy
**If Contract Actions Outlawed**:
- Public might be exposed to charlatans making wild promises
- Doctors could promise anything without accountability
- Example: "Don't worry, you'll be 100% cured of cancer—just pay $200,000"
- If patient dies, no breach of contract remedy available
- Would shake confidence in medical profession

**Balance**: Allow contract claims but scrutinize them carefully.

### C. Remedies (Not Covered in Detail This Semester)
Court discusses three types of interests (covered next semester):
1. **Restitution interest**
2. **Reliance interest**
3. **Expectation interest/damages**

**Note for California Practice**:
- Generally NO pain and suffering damages for breach of contract
- Generally NO punitive damages for breach of contract (absent fraud)
- Medical malpractice contracts may be exception in some jurisdictions

---

## XII. Auction Without Reserve

### **Behnke v. First Citizens Bank and Trust** (N.Y. 1936)

**Facts**:
- Defendant distributed circulars announcing auction "without reserve" of famous Smith collection of antiques
- Plaintiff flew from California to New York for auction
- On arrival, discovered auction canceled due to recession in antique market

**Issue**: Does plaintiff have cause of action?

**Holding**: No.

**Reasoning**:
- Circular was merely statement of intention to do something in the future
- NOT an offer that could be accepted
- Similar to concert venue announcing show then canceling before tickets sold

**Distinguishing Concert Hypothetical**:
- If tickets already sold = binding contract (with refund provisions if canceled)
- If no tickets sold yet = can cancel anytime
- Once tickets sold, venue bound (but usually has force majeure/Act of God provisions)
- May owe refund but generally not consequential damages (flights, hotels)

---

## XIII. Chicago Tribune Advertising Rates Case

### **Chicago Joint Board v. Chicago Tribune** (1969)

**Facts**:
- Chicago Tribune published booklet: "General Advertising Rates" (listing charges)
- Also published "Advertising Acceptability Guide" (indicating Tribune will refuse dishonest, indecent, or illegal ads)
- Labor union tendered advertisement urging readers not to patronize department store (due to low-wage foreign labor policy)
- Advertisement concededly not dishonest, indecent, or illegal
- Union tendered sufficient funds per advertising rates
- Tribune refused to print

**Issue**: Does union have cause of action for breach of contract? Was advertising rates booklet an offer?

**Holding**: No offer; no cause of action.

**Reasoning**:
1. **Not Language of Commitment**:
   - Fact that Tribune will refuse certain types of ads does NOT mean it must accept all others
   - "Necessary but not sufficient" test

2. **No Statement of Quantity**:
   - Not clear how many advertisements Tribune must accept
   - What if union wanted 50,000 ads published this Sunday?
   - No obligation to accept unlimited quantity

**Key Principle**: If there's no offer, there can never be acceptance (must have knowledge of offer before you can accept).

---

## XIV. Reasonable Time for Acceptance

### A. Default Rule
**If no time specified for acceptance**: Offer expires after **reasonable time**.

**What is reasonable time?** Depends on subject matter:
- **Cherries**: Hours (4 hours—they'll spoil)
- **Laptop**: Week to month
- **Crude oil**: 1 minute (volatile pricing)
- **Gold**: 5 minutes or less (stock market fluctuations)
- **Real estate**: Longer period

### B. Example
"I offer you this laptop for $2,000." (No time stated)
- Can offeree come next year and accept?
- Technically yes, but offeror can refuse
- Court will say acceptance not within reasonable time
- Offer effectively expired even if not explicitly revoked

### C. Merchant Firm Offer Exception (UCC)
- Under UCC, merchant firm offers may be irrevocable for up to 90 days
- Different rule—specific to merchants and written signed offers
- Will be covered in more detail later

---

## XV. Price Tags and In-Store Pricing

### General Rule
**Price tag on item (e.g., sweater for $50)**: NOT an offer.
- This is an advertisement/invitation to negotiate
- Buyer makes offer at checkout
- Store can refuse (though typically accepts)

**Why not an offer?**
- Quantity unclear (how many sweaters at that price?)
- General rule: in-store pricing is invitation, not offer
- Customer's bringing item to register = making an offer
- Cashier accepting payment = acceptance

---

## XVI. Revocation of Offers

### General Principle (Mentioned)
- Offeror can revoke own offer **before acceptance**
- Even if offeror stated "you must accept by Friday," can still revoke before Friday
- Exception: Option contracts and merchant firm offers (covered later)

**Example**: "I will sell you my motorcycle for $4,000, but you must accept by Friday."
- This IS an offer (invites acceptance on definite terms)
- Deadline setting doesn't make it NOT an offer
- But offeror can still revoke before Friday (absent consideration for keeping offer open)

---

## XVII. Key Exam Tips and Takeaways

### A. Reading MBE Questions
1. **Read call of question FIRST** (bottom of question)
   - Don't start at top with long fact pattern
   - Know what you're looking for before reading facts

2. **Time Management**:
   - Approximately 1 minute 27 seconds per MBE question
   - No time to re-read or second-guess
   - Must practice taking MBEs under time pressure

3. **Process of Elimination**:
   - Immediately cross out answers you know are false
   - Often one answer is clearly wrong
   - Two answers may be close
   - Pick the BEST answer (may not be perfect, but better than others)

4. **Circle and Move On**:
   - If stuck on question, circle it and move on
   - Come back later with fresh perspective
   - Better to answer all questions than get stuck on one

### B. Subjective vs. Objective Language
**Automatic Elimination**: Any answer referencing "subjective intent" is almost certainly WRONG.
- Law uses objective theory
- Throw out answers mentioning subjective intent

### C. Context Clues in Fact Patterns
**Pay attention to**:
- Relationship between parties (friends, coworkers, business associates, strangers)
- Circumstances of conversation (after frustrating day, at bar, in business setting)
- Knowledge of parties (did offeree know or should have known of impairment?)
- "Red herring" vs. meaningful facts

### D. Common Tricky Answer Patterns
1. **Answers that are partially correct** but contain one fatal flaw
2. **"Automatically void" language** (rarely true—usually subject to analysis)
3. **Missing elements** (e.g., "no contract because no writing" when statute of frauds doesn't apply)
4. **Reasonable person standard** vs. subjective belief

### E. Offer vs. Enforceable Contract
**Critical Distinction**:
- Question may ask: "Is this an offer?" vs. "Is there an enforceable contract?"
- Can have valid offer but unenforceable contract (due to Statute of Frauds, capacity, etc.)
- Read question carefully to know what's being asked

---

## XVIII. Summary of Key Rules

1. **Offer Definition**: Definite expression of willingness to enter bargain such that offeree justified in believing assent concludes deal

2. **UCC Quantity Rule**: Quantity is THE essential term; gap fillers don't apply to quantity (except output/requirements contracts)

3. **Objective Theory**: Contracts measured by reasonable person standard, not subjective intent

4. **Advertisements**: Generally invitations to negotiate UNLESS specific, definite terms including quantity and clear acceptance mechanism

5. **Incapacity**: Valid defense that can override objective theory if other party knew or should have known

6. **Price Quotations**: More likely to be offers when responding to specific inquiry with language of commitment

7. **Illusory Promises**: Not really promises; language that negates commitment means no offer

8. **Letters of Intent**: May contain binding specific provisions even if overall agreement not binding

9. **Gap Fillers**: Apply when parties silent on term, but NOT when parties agree to agree later

10. **Reasonable Time**: Default expiration for offers when no time specified; varies by subject matter
