# Property - Session 10

## Transcript

Mauricio Canas: I think I even mentioned the one time.

John Rogers: Sorry about that, everyone. So, when I log in, it just says, waiting for host.

John Rogers: So, I,

John Rogers: have to wait a little bit. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I think it's probably a problem on my end.

John Rogers: So, sorry to keep you waiting.

John Rogers: So, I did have kind of, like, a… review on…

John Rogers: Saturday, it's recorded, so I sent you guys an email with the recording. I did find out that if you don't download the video, it just cuts after 2 hours.

John Rogers: So you have to download the video, and you'll see the full 2 hours and 20 minutes.

John Rogers: I'll do the same thing this Saturday, too, if you want.

John Rogers: If you want.

doven: Will it be a real property review?

John Rogers: Yeah, for sure.

doven: I'll come…

Agnes Gholoonian: I'll definitely come. I missed your last one, so I really would appreciate it.

John Rogers: you guys don't have to come, I mean, it'll be recorded, so I'll email it to you guys.

John Rogers: But.

Agnes Gholoonian: If we joined the online class, or the review, would we be able to ask you questions?

John Rogers: girl.

Agnes Gholoonian: Oh, I hear them. Definitely be there.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: What?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: What time are you doing it again?

John Rogers: I don't know.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I'll do it after 2, because Frieckberg is doing a review 11 to 2 on Saturday.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Or before 11? 9 to 11?

Mireya Gonzalez: Yeah, before 11.

Karen Hernandez: Yeah.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Please?

John Rogers: what time?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: He's doing 11 to 2, his midterm review for contract.

John Rogers: Why don't you ask him property questions?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: We'd like to ask you the property question.

John Rogers: You can ask him. In fact, you know what? Ask him, and say that I told you to ask him. He will know what that means.

John Rogers: He will know what that means. Ask him. Ask him.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Pretty sure that's gonna go over well.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: No, I'm sure.

John Rogers: He will laugh, he'll laugh, because he used to teach property.

John Rogers: So… Hold on a second.

John Rogers: So yeah, he used to teach property, so you can ask him questions.

John Rogers: So, before 11, but… after 2?

Yessenia Soria: Can you do, like, 8 in the morning?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Your property… for your property, section is only one hour for that Saturday, so you're gonna probably just do an hour of your two-hour review, probably because you're doing evidence in the beginning.

John Rogers: Well, I did it only… I'm doing it for my evidence class, so I'm having reviews for them on Saturdays, because I don't think mentoring starts

John Rogers: for a couple more weeks, so I said I'd just give them some extra help, and we went over an essay that I just wrote up.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: And I'll go over another one with them. So, the second half, I'll do property.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Okay.

John Rogers: If you want to log in, like.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Like, an hour after.

John Rogers: Yeah, so here's the thing, if I started at 1.30, for example, like I did on Saturday.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: toothpay.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Perfect. Excellent.

John Rogers: Any questions?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Yeah, will you give more, essays, Professor, for us to practice and send to you?

John Rogers: How many… how many have I sent you?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: I think just one, the adverse possession.

John Rogers: You've been out for lunch.

John Rogers: I think I sent maybe 28.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Oh, no, no, no, no, no, I mean, like, for us to actually do… should we do those? Like, not look at the answers and, I guess, do those?

John Rogers: Do whatever you want.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: After tonight, you'll be able to do 50%. After tonight, you'll be able to do, officially 50%.

John Rogers: So, yeah, you could…

John Rogers: pick whichever one you want. The answers I gave you are student answers. I don't know which ones go to which questions, so you're gonna have to figure that out.

John Rogers: Some might not have answers.

John Rogers: And then, I may have given you a…

John Rogers: Some of the questions will match another question, too, because I just recycled it.

John Rogers: So, even during COVID, even during remote 24-hour finals, I'll just, change the names around and make Black Acre Greenacre.

John Rogers: And no one will tough, and no one can…

John Rogers: No one… most people don't, realize it.

John Rogers: Because I also have to write an evidence question or two, and I just… I don't want to write all these questions, so I maybe just recycle things.

John Rogers: I wanna show you guys something.

John Rogers: Any other questions that you guys wanna, talk about?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I just wanted to make a comment. They did your question number one in the mentoring session in your…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Of all the questions you put up, they did question number one, which was very tough.

John Rogers: Yeah, it was tough. Really?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: It was… it was, like, mixed with, like, things and…

John Rogers: It was short, right?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I don't think that necessarily makes it easy.

John Rogers: It does not.

doven: It was very tough. It was very tough.

John Rogers: No, once you get the hang of it.

John Rogers: they're not gonna be that tough. It's tough now, but it's not gonna be tough.

John Rogers: Because you'll look back at that and say, it's actually quite simple.

John Rogers: But just remember, when I write a question, I like to be very vague.

John Rogers: Nothing's ever clear. So if you ever write clear.

John Rogers: Red flags to me. Nothing's ever clear. It's always… it doesn't say what it is, doesn't say what happened, it's just so vague, because that causes you to think.

John Rogers: If it was clear, and something's obvious.

John Rogers: There's never points in the obvious.

Amir Akbari: I also have a question about that essay.

John Rogers: Okay.

Amir Akbari: There, there was a situation, we simplified the whole essay, we, applied the restraint and, Shelly's case, and then, we had just, like, clear.

Amir Akbari: statements, like O2A, and just…

Amir Akbari: how we should apply. We should apply first the restrain or Shelley's case. This is my question, because if we apply Shelly's case, there would be different answer than the restrain.

Amir Akbari: Applying restraint first.

John Rogers: Really?

John Rogers: Why?

Amir Akbari: Yeah, I… I can't… I don't want to take the time off the class at the first. We can do it at the end.

Amir Akbari: We can check it at the end, if… It's okay, because… It's a long discussion.

John Rogers: Okay, no problem, you can call me after class, or you can talk to me after class.

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: To hear from you.

Amir Akbari: Thank you Yeah, that's the hard part.

John Rogers: So, I finished all the adverse possession questions that you guys sent me, so if you wrote an answer and you sent it to me, to be quite frank with you guys so far.

John Rogers: I haven't come across a student that really hit it out of the park.

John Rogers: Because the first issue on the adverse possession question I sent you is Lutz versus Van Volkenberg.

John Rogers: Read that case.

John Rogers: Because it's… Similar, but also distinguishable from that fact pattern.

John Rogers: I was hoping people would be able to pick up on it.

John Rogers: I didn't see that anyone did.

John Rogers: So… So, if I were to give a final

John Rogers: that's kind of certain things that I would be looking for, because it…

John Rogers: it's a take-home final, so I have to be able to, like, Differentiate students and… it's just…

John Rogers: A way to test.

John Rogers: Oh, okay, well, someone sent me one on Monday, I guess… I missed it.

John Rogers: I'm gonna share my screen.

John Rogers: I want to go over a question with you.

John Rogers: I want to make it 1, there we go. This is a bar exam question.

John Rogers: This is on the bar, last year.

John Rogers: Ugh, can you guys see this okay?

John Rogers: I don't see it very well, but okay.

John Rogers: So… I want to go over this.

John Rogers: This was tested last year, and this is the first time I think the rule against perpetuities has ever been tested.

John Rogers: So, Olivia owns Greenacre and Fee Simple.

John Rogers: standard. Greenacre consists of two unapproved adjoining lots, A and B, so this is kind of a second semester issue. Dirt road.

John Rogers: This is dealing with easements. Don't worry, if you make the mistake of taking me next semester, we're gonna learn all about easements.

John Rogers: Trust me. And notice here, it says 60 years ago, so a long time ago.

John Rogers: 60 years ago.

John Rogers: Long time ago.

John Rogers: Olivia conveyed Lot B to Barry as a gift.

John Rogers: Yahoo, subject to the following clause. If at any time, so it's going to Barry, if at any time Barry, his heirs, successors, or assigns, shall use the premises for any purpose other than a personal residence, said Lot B, shall immediately vest and fee simple and Zach or his surviving descendants.

John Rogers: I don't care about anything else.

John Rogers: What is that?

John Rogers: I'll just drop in the chat. How's that?

John Rogers: Drop it in the chat.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: regulatory interest?

John Rogers: Hold on.

John Rogers: I just dropped in the chat so you can see it.

John Rogers: Now, I'd like to share my screen. The problem, though, is that I can't share the screen and see the question.

John Rogers: Maybe we can do this the old-fashioned way through memory.

John Rogers: So what… What do you guys think that… is it A or B? I think it's B, right? Barry?

John Rogers: what does… bury half.

John Rogers: Presumably Olivia, has a fee simple absolute, presumably, okay? What does B have?

John Rogers: Is it Barry? I forget. Yeah, Zach. Zach and Barry.

Amir Akbari: Be simple, executory limitation.

John Rogers: Yes… Yes… What does Z have?

Amir Akbari: Execut… shifting executive influence?

John Rogers: So, when I read that, this is… I just dumb it down. It looks like it's O to B,

John Rogers: Black Acre, or White Acre, or Greenacre? Is it Greenacre?

John Rogers: That's all I see.

John Rogers: That's all I see.

John Rogers: That's kind of what I see.

John Rogers: So… Z has an executor interest, what would…

John Rogers: So we have to apply the rule against perpetuities, right?

John Rogers: So is it valid or void?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Void.

John Rogers: every time.

John Rogers: Every time.

John Rogers: What happens now?

gevorg kulikyan: O2B and phi simple absolute.

John Rogers: Correct! Here's the difference, and this is… look at my notes.

John Rogers: because Z's interest is void.

John Rogers: Ugh.

John Rogers: It's going to cancel all of this out.

John Rogers: B equals V, simple, absolute.

John Rogers: Gone.

John Rogers: This did say, if you look at the question, it does say 60 years.

John Rogers: So when you say 60 years, that's bringing up U.S. wrap slash wait and see?

John Rogers: So you'd have to discuss common law, and U.S. Wrap.

John Rogers: About 90 years. See if the interest vests within 90 years.

John Rogers: Done.

John Rogers: Is that harder?

John Rogers: Does anybody know how to say a word?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yep.

Fatima Razavi: Hi.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: Yes?

John Rogers: Any questions on that?

John Rogers: Anyone have any trouble with that?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Did rap make it void because…

John Rogers: make it void. It's measured at the time of creation.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: the… Okay.

Amir Akbari: And there was some point you made last session about the other than language.

John Rogers: When there is an order done, what happened?

John Rogers: Otherwise…

Amir Akbari: Other than…

John Rogers: Other than…

Amir Akbari: Yeah, there was a point on that.

John Rogers: I don't know…

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: Other than… There's…

Amir Akbari: Is used for anything other than…

John Rogers: Oh, okay, yeah, so it's just… Use it for this purpose.

Amir Akbari: Just the simple, like, use it.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: So this was a bar exam question. The beauty of this is it's unlikely to be tested your go-around, okay? But they've already tested this, they're unlikely going to be going into it again.

John Rogers: So, good for you.

John Rogers: But, it's not really that hard.

John Rogers: I don't think so.

doven: I… my computer broke down.

doven: What is…

John Rogers: Excuse me?

doven: What did I miss? My computer…

John Rogers: What'd you miss? I don't know where your computer broke down at.

doven: Well, it kind of goes off and on, and it's, like, for 3 and 4 minutes.

John Rogers: Kinda like my brain.

John Rogers: Yeah. What was the last thing you heard?

doven: You're talking about, part of the exam, through the bargain?

John Rogers: I, I, I don't… I…

doven: Be simple.

John Rogers: It's recorded, so I'll tell you what, I'll tell you what. You can call me after class, you can call me this weekend and ask, but I don't want to go over it again, but it's definitely recorded so you can see.

doven: Do we get a copy of the stuff you put down?

John Rogers: Of what I… what I wrote down, like, my notes.

doven: Yeah.

John Rogers: Yeah, you can get a copy if you want.

doven: Thank you!

John Rogers: Any questions?

John Rogers: Alice, I didn't know you're in this class. I know you're in my evidence class, because you talk in evidence. I don't think you talk very much in this class, though. Or am I out to lunch?

Alice Orozco: No, I was asking questions last week about the joint tenancy and stuff.

John Rogers: Maybe I… maybe I got you confused and evidence now.

John Rogers: Anything else before we move on and get into the material again?

John Rogers: I'm gonna text the dean.

John Rogers: I'm gonna say, it's official. I think that my property class is just… they all have an IQ of 1500, they just don't even need to study. They don't even have questions.

doven: not…

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: So, can anyone tell me where we left off last week, exactly? Anybody know?

John Rogers: Because I don't think I was finished lecturing.

Fatima Razavi: Alternative contingent remainder.

John Rogers: I was definitely not talking about alternative contingent remains.

Fatima Razavi: You did talk about it.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Fantastic.

Fatima Razavi: stop it.

John Rogers: Where did I leave Paul?

Fatima Razavi: you said…

John Rogers: Oda A for life, then to B, C.

John Rogers: Where did I leave off in lecture?

John Rogers: last week.

Alice Orozco: I think it was on transfer, sell to oneself or another.

Alice Orozco: Joint tenancy?

John Rogers: I agree.

Alice Orozco: Thanks.

John Rogers: So, we'll go back into that.

John Rogers: Joint tenancy.

John Rogers: I should have started lecturing on tenants in common first, it's much easier.

John Rogers: but I didn't. So, joint tenancy. That's just to rehash it out.

John Rogers: Two or more people.

John Rogers: That have an interest in land.

John Rogers: And the survivor, the last remaining survivor of the bunch, two or more, Succeeds to 100% ownership interest.

John Rogers: So it could be 4 people, 5 people, 20 people. The last to survive Wins. Gets 100% ownership interest.

John Rogers: But let's just keep it easier. Let's say there's two people. Two people have an interest, 50-50.

John Rogers: But it's an undivided 50-50% interest.

John Rogers: So it doesn't mean that you get this side, I get this side.

John Rogers: you can use this part of the closet, and I'll use the other 50%.

John Rogers: It's altogether. It's just the interest is 50-50.

John Rogers: So if the house sells for \$100,000,

John Rogers: You both walk away with \$50,000.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: And to get a house like that, it'd probably be in the boonies of northern Arkansas.

John Rogers: But, the main importance of joint tenancy is creation of it, And potential severance.

John Rogers: Of the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Now, as I said last week.

John Rogers: To create a joint tenancy under the common law.

John Rogers: It requires establishing the four unities, time, title, interest, and possession.

John Rogers: I traditionally used to teach that.

John Rogers: And required that for my exam essays.

John Rogers: Because I wanted to see it, but I'm not going to require it for you guys. So, if it's a modern fact pattern, you won't have to discuss the four unities, but if it says common law, you do have to discuss them.

John Rogers: Because common law is what creates it.

John Rogers: Is, is, for unities is what creates a joint tenancy under the common law.

John Rogers: Modernally, it's specific language by the grantor evidencing the grantor's intent to create a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: O to A and B as joint tenants with a right of survivorship.

John Rogers: When we get into the casebook, we will see some examples where it… Is a bit unclear.

John Rogers: If it's hopelessly ambiguous, modernly defaults to tenants in common, common law defaults to joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Now, under the common law, If I own a piece of land, Under the common law.

John Rogers: And I fall in love, but I don't want to get married, but I fall in love! And I want to create a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: I can't execute a deed naming myself and my partner as joint tenants.

John Rogers: The common law requires a straw person, or otherwise known as straw man.

John Rogers: So… What I would have to do in that case.

John Rogers: is transfer the property to a third person. Oftentimes an attorney, it doesn't have to be.

John Rogers: And then, in return, that person transfers the property back to me.

John Rogers: and my partner. That way, we are taking from the same instrument our interest vests at the same time, and all the four unities are established.

John Rogers: Modernally, that's not required. And we'll learn from the cases that if I own property and fee simple absolute 100% ownership interest, and I want to create a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: I could just execute a deed naming myself and John Doe or Jane Doe.

John Rogers: File it, and there we go. We're a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: So Modernly is definitely relaxed on it. It's, it's no longer, the four unities are not an integral part of…

John Rogers: creation.

John Rogers: Let's talk about severance of the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Because… During Tennessee, there's always that… severance issue.

John Rogers: If I have a joint tenancy with you.

John Rogers: I am under no obligation and no requirement.

John Rogers: To let you know in advance

John Rogers: or notice you at all, if I want to sell it. Sell my interest.

John Rogers: So, if we have a house together in Long Beach, California, And… It's in joint tenancy.

John Rogers: and I sell my interest to Dean Frickberg, I don't have to tell you that I did that.

John Rogers: You don't even have to know about it.

John Rogers: So, once I sell my interest, that severs that joint tenancy that I have with you.

John Rogers: So, for note-taking purposes, you will then be tenants in common.

John Rogers: with Dean Frickburn, with 50-50 ownership interest.

John Rogers: The difference there is that… If you die, your errors only get 50%.

John Rogers: And the last remaining survivor, in a joint… in attendance in common, only gets…

John Rogers: what they have. They don't succeed to 100% ownership interest. They die with

John Rogers: Whatever interest they had before they died.

John Rogers: Another way to sever it is, sale or conveyance to oneself.

John Rogers: So, if you have a brother or sister, and you have a piece of land in Manhattan Beach, California.

John Rogers: And you executed a deed by yourself.

John Rogers: And then just name you as tenants in common, that severs the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: There's no requirement that you notify the other joint tenants. There is none. So you will see fact patterns that will say, without telling Jane, John sold his interest to Phil.

John Rogers: And many students jump on that and go, oh my god, that is terrible! Oh, John needs to die! He should be shot! And buried in the desert!

John Rogers: That's nothing.

John Rogers: That has no legal significance whatsoever.

John Rogers: People have their hand raised.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Go ahead, Dove.

doven: I was wondering, so what are there ways to…

doven: Bring a joint tenant in common is to name it.

doven: Make a will, name it between two people.

John Rogers: To create a joint tenancy?

doven: Or… Yeah, or… what did you just say, separate?

John Rogers: Sever it.

John Rogers: Let's talk about that for a second.

John Rogers: If I have two children, let's say, and I want to create a joint tenancy, and then when I die, I can create a will

John Rogers: that becomes operative when I die.

John Rogers: So the moment I die, that will becomes operative, and their interests will vest at the same time.

John Rogers: So they will then become joint tenants.

John Rogers: I can't, if I have a joint tenancy with you, let's say, I can't include that in my will.

John Rogers: if I die, before you.

John Rogers: My heirs will get zero.

John Rogers: If you're still alive, you get 100% ownership interest if I die before you. So your heirs get nothing.

John Rogers: That's been tested.

John Rogers: Another question?

doven: Thank you.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yeah, I had a question about the, sail to oneself?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Could you explain that one more time? I understand sale… selling your interest to another…

John Rogers: It should be transfer to oneself, because I don't think you're going to buy and sell to yourself. I don't know what I put in my notes, but I think it should be transfer to oneself.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: So, okay, if I have… interest in a property, how do I transfer it to myself again?

John Rogers: Cool?

John Rogers: Do you have that property in joint tenancy?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yes.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, all you do is, is you get a deed.

John Rogers: And you re-execute the deed to yourself.

John Rogers: Naming you as tenants in common.

John Rogers: with the other tenant. That's it. Severors it.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Oh, okay.

John Rogers: Yes, hand raised.

Amir Akbari: When you, change from the joint tenancy, it's gonna, convert to the tenancy in comments, like an example with the Dean Frickberg.

Amir Akbari: Selling to Dean Frickler.

John Rogers: Yes.

Amir Akbari: Always, right?

John Rogers: Always.

Amir Akbari: Okay, so if we have a joint tenant, and we sell it, it's gonna convert to the…

John Rogers: If you sell your interest to someone else.

Amir Akbari: Yes.

John Rogers: Other person will succeed to your interest and.

John Rogers: Comment.

Amir Akbari: Coming.

John Rogers: I'm gonna…

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: Now, the next way to sever a joint tenancy Is… not hard.

John Rogers: But it's… Maybe by… mortgage.

John Rogers: So, if you own property, in… Where?

John Rogers: Where's the property that you own?

John Rogers: Give me a place.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Burbank.

John Rogers: Burbank.

John Rogers: I never, ever go to Burbank. I can't even remember the last time I was ever even in Burbank.

John Rogers: So… Burbank House.

John Rogers: Let's supposing we have a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: in the Burbank house.

John Rogers: And you or me, let's just say me.

John Rogers: I need money.

John Rogers: I need money.

John Rogers: I need money, I need more of it.

John Rogers: Because it makes me happy.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, I go to a bank.

John Rogers: And I walk inside that bank.

John Rogers: Walk inside a bank.

John Rogers: That is going to be history one day.

John Rogers: Walking inside a bank is probably not going to exist in 10 years.

John Rogers: Nonetheless, I walk into the bank, and I ask to mortgage my interest.

John Rogers: in the Burbank residence. And the bank says, sure, we're gonna give you \$100,000.

John Rogers: Wonderful.

John Rogers: The question becomes… Does that mortgage… Sever.

John Rogers: the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: There's two theories.

John Rogers: One is the majority view, the other is the minority view.

John Rogers: The majority view Is that it does not sever the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: So long as I make all my payments.

John Rogers: And the bank does not foreclose on my interest.

John Rogers: The bank can't foreclose on your interest.

John Rogers: But, the bank can foreclose on my interest.

John Rogers: So long as I am making payments, and the bank does not foreclose, it's not going to sever the joint tenancy. That is the lien

John Rogers: theory. That is the majority view under the lien theory. Under the rationale that the bank just attaches a lien on the property.

John Rogers: But does not take title.

John Rogers: to the property.

John Rogers: It's a conditional lien.

John Rogers: That's conditioned on You making payment.

John Rogers: Whereas… the majority view, Oh, pardon, the minority

John Rogers: Title theory is exactly what it says. Under those minority views, the bank actually takes title.

John Rogers: So it says, John, we are going to be tenants in con… we are going to take title.

John Rogers: And be tenants in common with the other tenant.

John Rogers: You.

John Rogers: And if you pay us back, then we will re-convey title.

John Rogers: So, in a minority jurisdiction, Under a title theory.

John Rogers: It severs the joint tenancy because the bank takes title.

John Rogers: What about in situations, in a case we will read, is what happens if

John Rogers: I'm in the middle of making payments to the bank, and they're on time.

John Rogers: I pay my bills on time.

John Rogers: But, unfortunately, I die.

John Rogers: What happens?

John Rogers: What do you guys think happens?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: The surviving tenant takes the property free and clear.

John Rogers: Yes, that's correct, because the bank…

John Rogers: attached a lien against my interest, but I didn't have an interest.

John Rogers: when I docked.

John Rogers: So there's nothing for them to take.

John Rogers: So the bank loses.

John Rogers: Whereas?

John Rogers: Under a title theory, The bank doesn't lose it all, because the bank took title.

John Rogers: They're on title.

John Rogers: So banks, it's very risky in a lien theory.

John Rogers: It's very risky for a bank, because they could potentially lose out.

John Rogers: Questions?

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: If you go with title.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: to the bank, and you die. So do they become co-owners with the other person?

John Rogers: Yes, they will be tenants in common.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: with the other co-time.

Amir Akbari: But it would… it would be only for the part, the remaining parts, right? Not for the whole,

Amir Akbari: Amen. 50%.

John Rogers: 50%.

Amir Akbari: Oh, let's say you paid 50% of that loan.

Amir Akbari: You paid off 50% of that's loan.

Amir Akbari: They're gonna take the whole team?

John Rogers: Potentially, yeah. That is probably Real Property 3 class. So if you want to take Real Property 3, let me know. I'll propose it as an elective, and I'll expect you to take that class. But for Real Property, first semester.

John Rogers: You're not gonna need to know.

John Rogers: Oh, boy, I hope there's a real Property 3.

John Rogers: Yes, hand raised.

doven: So the two ways to sever it is… is it title, is it, what is it, Vita 1, Title I, and…

doven: This, the interests, getting a mortgage?

John Rogers: So… This arises when there's a joint tenancy, And… One of the tenants Mortgages their interest.

John Rogers: So, if the fact pattern doesn't say what type of jurisdiction, like lien theory or title theory, then you have to discuss both.

John Rogers: But ultimately, in a majority view, it's not going to sever the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Minority will. Temper.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: I think I've covered everything that I've wanted to for joint tenants, missing something.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: What if… Can I ask a question?

John Rogers: Yeah.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: So, if you do the titling, like, the title loan.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: But fraudentially say that you own the whole thing.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: And then he dies.

John Rogers: So, you have a joint tenancy, you go to the bank, and it's a title theory?

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: Yeah, you give the title, so… but…

John Rogers: You… or the bank gets the title.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: Yeah, the maintenance side.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: But you fraud them, like, you, you…

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: You deceive it, you say that you're the full owner of it.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: But there's a co-partner in there.

John Rogers: Well, here's the thing. A… there… I don't think I provided you law, but a co-tenant, if you have a co-tenancy, joint tenants, tenants of condens, tenants by the entire… you can't prejudice the other co-tenant.

John Rogers: So the maximum that the bank would receive is only 50%. Whatever interest the person who frauded them Hat.

Yessenia Soria: What if the other person says, you know what, I don't want to lose my property, I don't want the bank to have title, gets a loan and pay out… pays the bank the other 50% of the other joint tenant?

Yessenia Soria: Can he do that?

John Rogers: Sure.

John Rogers: Buy out, for sure. Why not?

John Rogers: Money talks.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Amir Akbari: I had a question last week about the percentage of joint tenancy.

Amir Akbari: If they can be… the percentage of the joint tenancy. If they could be different, like, someone have 50%, the other 25, 25?

Amir Akbari: And what happened on that situational risk possible?

John Rogers: I've seen this question before.

John Rogers: It's equal interest.

John Rogers: my… I don't wanna… say… Exactly.

John Rogers: I'm in the camp.

John Rogers: Edit.

John Rogers: Must be equal shares.

John Rogers: It sounds like a good research assignment for you.

Amir Akbari: Here, just, we assume everything is equal.

Amir Akbari: indoors.

John Rogers: I'm not… Really in the business of making you do too much math?

John Rogers: Because I don't… like to… read math?

John Rogers: That makes sense.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, I love that.

John Rogers: Oh, good, okay.

John Rogers: Yeah, I'm not gonna throw trigonometry in there, but maybe… Algebra 2.

John Rogers: the new tree.

John Rogers: Anything else? I think I've covered everything I wanted to for joint tenants.

Alice Orozco: I have a question.

Alice Orozco: If there's a fact pattern for joint tenants under common law, How would we…

Alice Orozco: Explain, say it's two siblings, how would we explain the unity of possession? It says each tenant has an identical right of enjoyment. What if…

Alice Orozco: two siblings, but they're renting it out. How would we explain, like, that right of enjoyment?

John Rogers: They're both renting the property out.

Alice Orozco: Yeah, or, like, one brother lives there or something, or they're just both renting it out to somebody, so how would we explain that each sibling has an identical right of enjoyment?

John Rogers: We do.

John Rogers: 50-50.

Alice Orozco: Okay.

John Rogers: enjoy their property as they please. It's very common for them to rent out property, and

John Rogers: lease it to someone. We'll actually get into that probably in the next hour.

Alice Orozco: Okay.

John Rogers: Maybe, no, probably sooner than that.

John Rogers: 20 minutes.

John Rogers: But when you look at that… you look at it, does someone have…

John Rogers: more of a rite of enjoyment than the other, like… like, Alice can use… More of the garage.

John Rogers: John can only use the treehouse.

John Rogers: So it's equal right on all of the property.

John Rogers: John can lease it, Alice can't, though.

John Rogers: That's not equal right of enjoyment.

John Rogers: So, if there's restrictions… So it should just be completely equal.

Alice Orozco: Thank you.

John Rogers: I think that's it for that. So, tenancy by the entirety is actually, a bit more simple now that we've gone into joint tenants, because tenancy by the entirety is just joint tenancy plus

John Rogers: Marriage.

John Rogers: Joint tenancy plus marriage. Carries that survivorship right.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: It can be terminated. The only way to terminate a tenancy by the entirety, and this is getting mixed in with community property, are you guys in community property now, or no? No, it's probably next semester, I would assume, right?

Alice Orozco: Yeah.

John Rogers: Yeah. So, community property is next, next.

John Rogers: semester. You'll learn all about this, trust me. But in order to sever it, you can't just give it away.

John Rogers: You have to have the agreement.

John Rogers: Of the spouse, other spouse.

John Rogers: You can't terminate it. It's… a tenancy by the entirety is terminated upon death.

John Rogers: G…

John Rogers: Parties of the tenants in common can execute an agreement, as long as it's voluntary, it's mutual, to sever it.

John Rogers: Or under, you know, what no one ever, ever, ever sees coming, because it's just impossible, it's never gonna happen, but divorce.

John Rogers: I think that there are situations…

John Rogers: I don't have too much information on it because it is, getting into community property. I don't teach community property. I never will teach community property. I don't like community property. But you can ask

John Rogers: Professors, what, Steve Zand or Steve Mancini? Both are family law attorneys.

John Rogers: You can ask them all you want about community property laws. But there is law that says that creditors can dive into

John Rogers: And perhaps terminate a tenancy by the entirety interest.

John Rogers: Not something that I test on.

John Rogers: And I don't believe I discussed…

John Rogers: tenants in common. So this is actually quite simple. I usually start off teaching it, but tenants in common is just like a joint tenancy. The only difference, though, is that

John Rogers: the last remaining survivor doesn't succeed 100% ownership interest. It's… if you have tens in common with your brother or sister, you each have 50%, if you die, 50% goes to your heirs. If they die, that 50% goes to their heirs.

John Rogers: And you can divide it, too. So, if…

John Rogers: You and me have 50-50 interest, I might sell 25 to Frickberg.

John Rogers: And then 25, when I die, will go to my heirs. So then you?

John Rogers: Strickberg and my heirs will each have

John Rogers: You will have 50% interest, Dean Frickberg will have 25% interest, and my heirs will have 25% interest.

John Rogers: It's not gonna be beyond what you have, though. Not gonna take yours, okay? Yes! Hand raised.

doven: So, it's different from tenants and survivorship, and tenants in common, they can sell to other people their parts of their property, their share.

John Rogers: Yes, absolutely. Yeah, you can sell… I mean, as tenants in common, you can sell to whomever you want.

doven: Tenants and survivorship, they can't.

John Rogers: Joint tenants? Yeah, you can. You can sell your interest to whomever you want.

doven: Oh, so you can sell your interest in either one.

John Rogers: Yeah, most definitely. I was all done.

John Rogers: It's just, once you sell your interest in a joint tenancy?

John Rogers: The other tenant becomes tenants in common with whomever you sold it or conveyed it to.

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So you can kind of see, some essays that I've given you. This is kind of how adverse possession kind of triggers.

John Rogers: Where you have one tenant in joint… two tenants in joint tenancy, one sells their interest without telling the other.

John Rogers: And then that person dies, and then one tries to claim an interest, and the other one says, I don't know who you are, you don't have any interest, and a fight happens.

John Rogers: So there's no requirement of actually alerting, one of the joint tenants that,

John Rogers: There's… there's… there's no requirement of alerting the joint tenants in advance.

John Rogers: Letting them know.

John Rogers: But tenants in common is a concurrent form of ownership interest. It's…

John Rogers: Same is joint tenancy, except there's no survivorship right.

John Rogers: So it's undivided, though.

John Rogers: So it doesn't mean that you get…

John Rogers: this part of the toilet, and I get this part of the toilet.

John Rogers: like, if you're married, do you ever tell your husband or wife, sweetheart, you can go, do your business on that side, and then I'll just use this side.

John Rogers: there's no… divided interest. It's undivided.

John Rogers: But nonetheless, each of us have 50% ownership interest in that toilet.

John Rogers: It's a nice toilet. It's a Japanese toilet. There's this modernized Japanese toilet that's, like, 8 grand.

John Rogers: So this is important.

John Rogers: I don't think anyone laughed at that.

John Rogers: Questions so far?

Sennett Devermont: Are tenants in common required to tell the other party?

Sennett Devermont: Neither have to tell.

Sennett Devermont: And then also, how… I see how tenants in common become joint tenants, but can joint tenants become tenants in common? Or can it go the other way?

John Rogers: Joint tenants become tenants in common?

Sennett Devermont: Whoa… If it's joint tenancy, can I…

Sennett Devermont: I don't know, can I turn into a tenants in common at some point, in any way, or…

John Rogers: If it's a joint tenancy, can it turn into… yes, we can… I can agree with you.

John Rogers: to say, let's transition our tenancy to tenants in common. Or I can do it without you knowing, and then just re-execute a deed to myself without telling you, and we just severed it, and now we became tenants in common, and you had no clue.

John Rogers: Yes.

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, how can we identify if it's tenants in common or joint tenants? Like, in the example 02A and B.

gevorg kulikyan: It can be both in that situation, can it not?

John Rogers: It potentially can, yes.

John Rogers: Yeah? You don't know.

gevorg kulikyan: Would we be able… oh, we… We would just have to…

gevorg kulikyan: Just identify both and say what happens if whatever is decided.

John Rogers: There's going to be a bit more facts That will lend,

John Rogers: That will kind of tell you

John Rogers: There's gonna be more facts that are… that's going to tell you,

John Rogers: what it kind of would be sometimes. Not sometimes, but,

John Rogers: There'll be facts to tell you.

gevorg kulikyan: Got it. And then also, in tenants in common, so let's say A dies.

gevorg kulikyan: So do A's, airs, and B. B is still alive. So A's, airs, and B…

gevorg kulikyan: Become tenants in common together.

John Rogers: Say that one more time.

gevorg kulikyan: So it's O2A and B.

gevorg kulikyan: And then A dies, but B is alive.

John Rogers: O to A and B.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: Okay?

gevorg kulikyan: So, A dies, And it's under tenants in common.

gevorg kulikyan: So, A is heirs, and B, Become tenants in common now.

John Rogers: That is correct.

gevorg kulikyan: Thank you.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: So… To go over tenants in common.

John Rogers: Just to kind of rehash out tenants in common versus joint tenancy.

John Rogers: you want to look at creation. Just to create tenants in common, it's just O to A and B as tenants in common.

John Rogers: But if it shows more of intentions of creating a survivorship, it's going to be joint tenancy.

John Rogers: So, the difference between the two is this. If we have Attendance in common.

John Rogers: in… A Santa Monica house.

John Rogers: We are tenants in common.

John Rogers: And I die.

John Rogers: 50% of that house Goes to my heirs.

John Rogers: And you will be tenants in common, 50% ownership interest, with my heirs, or Frickberg, if I designate Frickberg to succeed to my estate. So you will be tenants in common with Dean Frickberg, 50-50.

John Rogers: But, if we have a joint tenancy in the Santa Monica house.

John Rogers: And I die.

John Rogers: You succeed to 100% ownership interest.

John Rogers: It's all yours.

John Rogers: So, I like to kind of think of it like this.

John Rogers: There's motive for murder in a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Because… You have every motive to kill the other joint tenants, because you will get 100% ownership interest.

John Rogers: But tenants in common? No.

John Rogers: Does that make sense, everyone?

John Rogers: Motive for murder.

Yessenia Soria: Any of you go to jail for murder?

Yessenia Soria: Who gets your, your, your half?

John Rogers: well… They would just put it on your commissary so you get extra soups each week.

John Rogers: What actually happens, is it will… you'll forfeit. It will forfeit.

Yessenia Soria: Okay.

John Rogers: Trust.

Yessenia Soria: So it won't go to your errors or anything?

John Rogers: If you kill the other joint tenant.

Yessenia Soria: Yeah.

John Rogers: You forfeit your interest, so the other joint tenant, their heirs will get it, whomever they're designating.

John Rogers: So that's why you just don't get caught.

John Rogers: So don't involve your cell phone at all.

Agnes Gholoonian: What happens when both die? So, both owners end up dying?

Agnes Gholoonian: And then does it go to both heirs? So, like, one of them dies.

Agnes Gholoonian: You know, you have 100%, and then you die, does it then split again to 50-50 for each heir?

John Rogers: Well… Interesting question, because millions upon millions upon millions have been litigated over this very issue. Who died?

John Rogers: Oops.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: What if they die together?

John Rogers: Well, what do you mean?

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: They're in the same car, they die together.

John Rogers: Well, I mean, I wouldn't just say, oh, okay, you know, whatever.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: No, but we'll go through…

John Rogers: Where did the impact happen first? From the left side or the right side?

John Rogers: Remember when we were talking about this last week, that there was a train? There was two very smart people that were playing on train tracks that just didn't even notice a train was coming?

John Rogers: Wow.

John Rogers: And they were ran over, and one of the witnesses saw blood squirting out of the neck of one of the

John Rogers: future decedents.

John Rogers: And they determined that that…

John Rogers: At least there's some evidence to show that that person survived longer, because you can't squirt blood unless your heart is still beating.

doven: Could I go by who the first one who's still breathing? Or who breathed last?

John Rogers: Yeah, we have a breathes last. So if we drown, hey, I can hold my breath longer than you.

John Rogers: I don't typically test on something like that, and if I did, it would be fairly obvious, but I've never tested on something like this.

doven: So in the essay pattern, if we see two people are granted by deed by one person to own a home, we can say that's joint tenancy in common.

doven: Whereas… Then another partner, they just jointly own the home by deed, and they.

John Rogers: I can't really give you a straight answer, because it's… depending upon what the grantor intended, but what I did tell you is that there must be specific language to create that joint tenancy with that survivorship right, because how else can you determine that?

John Rogers: Otherwise, it would likely just be tenants in common.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: Questions about the tenancies?

John Rogers: Because there's 3 types. Most commonly tested is joint tenancy, and it's usually severed and then transposes into

John Rogers: transitions into, tenants in Comment.

Alice Orozco: Is it just preference on how…

Alice Orozco: like, their deed is written. Like, understand the motive for murder for joint tenants if two people are going in on a property, but why not just go with tenants in common so that if they die.

Alice Orozco: Their heirs can get it.

John Rogers: Why? That's a good question.

John Rogers: Maybe, maybe… It's different, because it can always be severed.

John Rogers: Okay, but maybe, like, grandma wants to leave you and your sister, for example, the property, but we don't want you to, you know, do anything stupid with it.

John Rogers: So maybe that there are limitations.

John Rogers: Or,

John Rogers: I mean, my father had a joint tenancy with his high school best friend. I'm like, Dad, you shouldn't be doing that.

John Rogers: There could be reasons, maybe business reasons, financial reasons, maybe you want to buy a property with someone, and they're older.

John Rogers: So, I don't know.

John Rogers: Intriguing.

John Rogers: Find reasons why.

John Rogers: business reasons?

John Rogers: I believe that there are… might be some tax reasons, too.

John Rogers: as well.

John Rogers: But that's beyond me, because I don't like taxes.

John Rogers: Someone else has her… Ms. Gonzalez has her hand raised.

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes. I don't know if I told you this.

John Rogers: Your glasses, the supervising judge of the criminal division of the entire Los Angeles Superior Court, wears those glasses.

Mireya Gonzalez: I don't know if I should… Compliment or not?

John Rogers: She's super cool. She's super cool.

Mireya Gonzalez: Take it.

John Rogers: I think it's a compliment.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay, great. Okay, so I know for a joint tenancy, it can be severed, and for tenants by the entirety, it can be terminated. For tenants in common, is… like, can that be terminated or severed?

Mireya Gonzalez: No? Okay. Thank you.

John Rogers: Anything else?

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, I just…

gevorg kulikyan: if we see that it's two people, that are receiving the property, like, O2A and B,

gevorg kulikyan: And it's in fee simple absolute, it's most likely gonna be tenants in common.

John Rogers: Probably, because a presumption is going to be tenants in common.

John Rogers: remember, the…

John Rogers: there must be clear intentions, or specific language from the grantor to create a joint tenancy. So what is the grantor intending to create? We'll go over some examples of that. But I would say under that scenario, it'd be tenancy common.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, and in life, it could never be tenants in common, right?

gevorg kulikyan: If they're receiving the property in life.

John Rogers: I think potentially they could.

John Rogers: Because if it's for their lives.

John Rogers: I think the last remaining survivor would get 100% ownership interest in the single life estate. Good, wonderful question, though.

John Rogers: Fantastic question.

gevorg kulikyan: Thank you.

doven: So, joint tenancy… confusion where your joint tuition Commons can sell, and joint tenancy can't.

John Rogers: Yeah, you can, you can self-joint tenancy. Self, absolutely, tenancy by the entirety. Just remember, marriage. Restricted.

John Rogers: Your spouse has to agree.

John Rogers: You gotta excuse them.

John Rogers: Trying to be funny.

John Rogers: Any other questions on that?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Well, there's going to be situations where tenants, maybe there are… Joint tenants?

John Rogers: tends to come in.

John Rogers: If there's 3 people, 5 people, 10, or 2.

John Rogers: But people don't always get along, do they?

doven: No, they don't.

John Rogers: Yeah, that's right, they don't always get along.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: So what happens when… A situation arises where, for example, maybe one party

John Rogers: Wants to sell the property entirely?

John Rogers: And another one doesn't.

John Rogers: What happens?

John Rogers: How do you agree?

Agnes Gholoonian: Option of a buyout?

John Rogers: Yeah, probably… Could be the case. Yeah, but I… that's not in this class, though.

John Rogers: But yeah, in fact, I wasn't expecting that answer, to be honest. But, in this textbook, what,

John Rogers: what happens?

gevorg kulikyan: Can't they just sell their own interest? Their 50%?

John Rogers: Maybe someone doesn't want to buy that 50%, though.

gevorg kulikyan: Well, if somebody doesn't want 50%, they probably don't want 100% either.

John Rogers: Well, we have a situation here that's called a Partition.

John Rogers: a partition. So one of the parties can go to court and ask the court to do one of two things.

John Rogers: Physically divide the property.

John Rogers: You get that side, I get this side.

John Rogers: You get the northern half, I get the southern half.

John Rogers: physically divide the property. That is called a partition in Kind.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Physically dividing the property.

John Rogers: And then there is, a concept called partition for

John Rogers: Sale. And that occurs when the sale is just sold, And you split the proceeds.

John Rogers: in a.

doven: Lisa, partitions stay bill.

John Rogers: A what?

doven: You said partition of Stateville, sold, and split, proceeds.

John Rogers: Partition in kind is… Actually, physically dividing the property.

John Rogers: partition for sale is selling the property and splitting the proceeds, and the tenants would get the proceeds, in the amount they have in the property. So if I have 75% in the Santa Monica house, and you only get 25, and the house sells for \$100,000,

John Rogers: you get \$2.50, I get 700, I get, 75. You get 25, I get 75.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Is this similar to, like, a for sale, basically?

John Rogers: Kind of like that, yeah. So, this is the analysis, and guys, I've tested this twice.

John Rogers: Since COVID.

John Rogers: The analysis is… What is the best interest of the parties?

John Rogers: And it's a balancing test.

John Rogers: It's a balancing test.

John Rogers: So you have to determine, why does this party

John Rogers: want to do this. Why does this party want to do this?

John Rogers: What are the repercussions and impacts?

John Rogers: they would have.

John Rogers: So, for example, if I reside on the property, and I've lived on this property for 30 years.

John Rogers: And I run my business from my house. Let's supposing I have a marijuana business. I grow marijuana. I like what I do, I've been doing it for years.

John Rogers: A problem arises of just selling the property, because my livelihood exists here.

John Rogers: So that might be a bit of an issue. So what is equitable?

John Rogers: And there is no true right answer, it's just the court determines what is in the party's best interest.

John Rogers: And that's the analysis.

John Rogers: Maybe I want to sell it because, I foresee that the market is going to go down big time. There's going to be a big real estate market crash. I just want to get out now. Maybe I'll repurchase it once it crashes again.

John Rogers: Make sense?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Generally, though, it would be difficult to physically divide

Nathan Rabiezadeh: A property with dwellings on it and stuff like that, no?

John Rogers: Oh, sure. The climate, the characterization of the property is significant, too. How do you determine that? What happens if there's mountains and creeks and…

John Rogers: All kinds of stuff.

John Rogers: 7.47. Do you guys want to take a break now, 15 minutes?

John Rogers: Sound okay?

doven: Professor Keith.

doven: Give that paper you did for the RSA.

John Rogers: Yeah, I'll send it to you guys at the end of class, but… Okay.

John Rogers: Yeah. Alright, we're gonna see you guys in 15 minutes.

John Rogers: I guess we'll get started again. Hope everyone had a wonderful break.

John Rogers: Any questions, since you've, had a little bit of time to be able to digest this so far.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: If there's a joint tenancy, and…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: the… they're 50% each, one dies, one takes 100%. That 100% person gives 50% to their…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I don't know, cousin, are they now tenants in common?

John Rogers: Say that one more time?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: There's a joint tenancy with, like, a brother and sister, they own it together.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: the brother dies first, so the sister takes 100% in a joint tenancy, right? That sister then gives 50% to her uncle, or their… or buys it, whatever. There are tenants in common now, right?

John Rogers: Yep.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Okay.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Is there… is there any limitations on, tenants in common and joint tenants as far as how many people are in them?

John Rogers: Zero limitation.

John Rogers: Mr. Sananian, your sister… Pretty much told me to call on you tonight.

Daniel Sinanian: I know she did, she did mention it today.

John Rogers: Oh yeah, I talked to her after class last night.

John Rogers: She said, do you ever call on my brother? And I said, I should, huh? And she's like, yeah.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

doven: You need to say that everything is in… what you're saying is in the notes, so we can look at the notes.

John Rogers: So… Is that a question?

doven: No.

John Rogers: Nope, I just saying things? Alright.

John Rogers: Okay, so I guess we'll resume then.

John Rogers: So, where we left off was partitions. Partitions?

John Rogers: There are two types.

John Rogers: If the call of the question, or the fact pattern is silent as to which one, you discuss both.

John Rogers: In fact, you've always discussed both.

John Rogers: Because it's based on the best interests of the parties.

John Rogers: And the parties are generally going to have competing interests.

John Rogers: You discuss both, and it's an analysis of equity.

John Rogers: What is in the better interest? Which one outweighs the other?

John Rogers: Questions on it?

John Rogers: It's tested.

John Rogers: It's tested, I've tested on it twice.

John Rogers: Twice.

Amir Akbari: So, for partition for sale, they, they, and they will sell the whole,

Amir Akbari: property, then they will get the parts, right? They will get the money, right?

John Rogers: They will get the proportion of.

Amir Akbari: Poor portion of their shape.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Amir Akbari: But they sell the whole thing.

John Rogers: Hey, it's the whole thing.

Amir Akbari: Meh.

Amir Akbari: But in the kind, there should be just divided physical.

John Rogers: You, you mentioned something, I don't know if they sell it part, part sale, I don't…

John Rogers: I actually don't know what happens if they want to agree to

John Rogers: partly sell it. Well, it's an agreement.

John Rogers: So then…

John Rogers: partition wouldn't really be an issue. But you said as far as the judicial sale, the property is sold, and the proceeds are…

John Rogers: Given to… in proportion to the ownership interests of the cotangents.

Amir Akbari: If it's…

John Rogers: partitioning kind, the land is physically divided.

Amir Akbari: interoperitex.

Amir Akbari: So, but the procedure is, like, the judge decides, then they're gonna decide in each of them which routes they should follow, or…

John Rogers: which roots?

Amir Akbari: Yeah, I mean, the kind or safe.

John Rogers: Well, the judge determines what is…

Amir Akbari: determines. Then they're gonna do the…

John Rogers: Judge determines it.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: But you don't have to say judge in your exam.

John Rogers: The judge decides. In fact, I hate the word judge.

John Rogers: On a final exam.

John Rogers: I hate it. I don't like it.

doven: We say court… Court, your court may decide.

John Rogers: Maybe you could say that I don't really care about that word either.

John Rogers: Judge Verostigi, do you have a question?

John Rogers: Her name is Yvette Verastiki.

John Rogers: But I'm talking to Ms. Gonzalez.

Mireya Gonzalez: Sorry, my… it was going in and out. My question… you said that to discuss both in an essay, both partitions, and you said, what is the best interest of the parties? Can you give an example to where that would apply?

John Rogers: Whoa…

John Rogers: Yeah, I mean, we… yeah, I mean, we kind of have a case on it, but, think of it like this. It's Blackacre.

John Rogers: And like I said before, I live on Black Acre.

John Rogers: I run my marijuana business from Blackacre.

John Rogers: I provide medicine to patients.

John Rogers: And you live in the Hamptons.

John Rogers: You live across the country.

John Rogers: And your only interest is financial.

John Rogers: you want to sell it because maybe you want to fund a trip to the south of Paris, woohoo, and maybe pay off your current mortgage in the Hamptons.

John Rogers: What would be in the best interest?

John Rogers: Selling the property.

John Rogers: And splitting the proceeds?

John Rogers: If that's the case, that means I have to move. I have to relocate my business.

John Rogers: What are my patients gonna do? They need their medicine.

John Rogers: And, I have to find a new place to live.

John Rogers: Whereas for you, it's not very much of a burden at all.

John Rogers: But at the same time, There's financial reasons, too.

John Rogers: Maybe we do want to sell it, because maybe it's expected that the market is gonna turn around, and things are gonna crash.

John Rogers: So I can't give you A solid answer, because it's kind of just a balancing test.

John Rogers: You just weigh the interests of both parties.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Can't that person just sell their interest and leave their percentage?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: If they're…

John Rogers: that person.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: So one, you said, because they need to do a partition in a joint tenancy, or a tenancy common with… let's just say they're 50-50.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: And he needs to go buy a new house or whatever, so he wants to get out of the property, right? Is that… am I saying that correctly? Why… in a joint tenancy or tenants in common, they can… without notifying the other person in the tenants in common, joint tenancy, they can sell their own and just leave, right? Without telling them?

John Rogers: 50%.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: That, right.

John Rogers: 50%, sure, you could do that. You could sell it.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Because regardless, if they were to do a partition for sale, he only owns 50% anyways, right? So he was…

John Rogers: Yep.

Amir Akbari: So, what is the purpose of going to the court for that?

Amir Akbari: Meaning the partitions, say.

John Rogers: Maybe… well, here's the thing, maybe no one wants to buy it.

John Rogers: I want to develop all of this property.

John Rogers: But I can't?

Amir Akbari: I can know you.

John Rogers: Now I owned a piece of land with a stranger.

John Rogers: Yes.

doven: So, joint tenancy and joint in common, so, you know, they sell their property, and if we had to write in the fact pattern about

doven: You know, going to a court, we don't use judge or the word court.

John Rogers: I just think this. Here's… this is my position on when I read final exams.

John Rogers: The court will decide, the judge… oh, God, I don't care.

John Rogers: I don't care about the word court or judge, and that's for both of my classes, evidence AND property.

John Rogers: Who cares?

John Rogers: Want to know what YOUR arguments are.

John Rogers: Let someone else decide.

John Rogers: But for something kind of like this, I guess you could…

John Rogers: Within the rule, you can say the court will balance the best interests of the parties.

John Rogers: But your discussion and rationale is, you shouldn't really have to mention court.

John Rogers: or judge.

Amir Akbari: So, in this area, our analysis is more around the balancing test, right? Which one is more…

Amir Akbari: Tommy nights, probably.

John Rogers: Well, yeah, it's, it's, it's analysis of equity.

Amir Akbari: Yep.

John Rogers: Determine what is the… Best.

Amir Akbari: Best interest.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Questions?

Agnes Gholoonian: I have a stupid question.

John Rogers: Oh, well, let's see how stupid it is. Everyone, pay attention. I want to hear this.

Agnes Gholoonian: No, I just… can you please repeat the definition of partition?

John Rogers: Partition?

John Rogers: The definition? It's in my notes.

John Rogers: But… Just, what you need to know is, is this.

John Rogers: When there's a fight.

John Rogers: over what to do with the property. Someone wants to sell it, someone wants to stay.

John Rogers: the court is going to have to make a determination of what is in the best interest of the parties. So the rule, the analysis, is what is in the party's best interest? Is it to order a judicial sale and just sell the property and split the proceeds and everyone walks away? Or do we physically divide the property?

John Rogers: You get that half, I get this half.

John Rogers: What is in the party's best interest?

John Rogers: That's all it is. And the analysis is… It's a balancing test.

John Rogers: equity issues.

Agnes Gholoonian: And in our analysis, we discuss what we believe is the correct decision.

John Rogers: Just be careful about saying the word.

John Rogers: I.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay, yeah, of course.

Agnes Gholoonian: Thank you.

John Rogers: This goes for everyone, don't say I.

John Rogers: And don't ever say, We.

John Rogers: Because what I see… Wee.

John Rogers: what do I start thinking?

John Rogers: I mean, I start thinking, like.

John Rogers: Start kind of, like, looking around, like, Who?

John Rogers: Like, us?

John Rogers: Like, are we together?

John Rogers: Kind of, like, together. Together a little bit, right? Yeah, we're together. It's we. Hey, we're doing this. We. Who's we? Who's we? Who are you there with?

John Rogers: So don't use We.

John Rogers: Or I. Ever.

John Rogers: It's not… Proper writing.

John Rogers: When you kind of say the words, we, you start making it kind of personalized with the greater, and you shouldn't do that.

John Rogers: So just be careful about saying, we.

John Rogers: But students have a tendency to write that. It's fine, it's just, just careful.

John Rogers: A lot of people do. Any questions?

John Rogers: I don't think that was a stupid question, by the way.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Now…

John Rogers: Rents and profits, is it?

John Rogers: ouster.

John Rogers: Alistair.

John Rogers: Ooster is tested, okay? O-U-S-T-E-R.

John Rogers: That is tested on essays, Multiple choice questions.

John Rogers: Tested it multiple times within the past… 12 years.

John Rogers: Multiple times, probably maybe 5-6 times. Almost, like, every other year.

John Rogers: You and me.

John Rogers: We… of… Let's say we're tenants in common.

John Rogers: And we have a house together. Where is our house? Pick a place.

Alice Orozco: La Jolla.

John Rogers: Oh, it is a nice place.

John Rogers: What is a nice place?

John Rogers: Very next place. I live in Ludlow.

John Rogers: Of course, right? Absolutely.

John Rogers: We have a La Jolla residence.

John Rogers: in ouster, Occurs when one of the tenants?

John Rogers: refuses to honor The other co-tenants.

John Rogers: rights.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: So, think of it like…

John Rogers: Alice said Loya, was that you, Alice?

John Rogers: Yeah. It was me.

John Rogers: So… let's suppose, and we have this La Jolla house, and you want to come over.

John Rogers: To the house, and I say, Alice.

John Rogers: You can't be here. Get. Off.

John Rogers: Get out.

John Rogers: I am refusing to honor Alice's access to the property.

John Rogers: She is asserting her right to the property, I am refusing it.

John Rogers: Remember, she has 50% ownership interest, it's undivided.

John Rogers: So we share the same toilet, right? The toilet is not divided in half, right?

John Rogers: Same with the property.

John Rogers: So, an ouster… has then occurred.

John Rogers: It's arguing about whether or not a single statement failing to recognize another co-tenant's interest, would constitute an ouster.

doven: So the… so the person who's telling him… telling the other co-pinter, you can't be here, they are ousted.

John Rogers: Can't be here. Get off the property, I'm gonna shoot you.

doven: So they get ousted from the property.

John Rogers: Ousting you from the property.

John Rogers: Maybe I'm changing the locks specifically to refuse, to make sure you don't enter?

John Rogers: So I am oustering another co-deen, and do not underestimate this. This could… this could be a rabbit hole and come up.

John Rogers: Now, can you adversely possess a co-tenant?

John Rogers: You cannot.

John Rogers: Because each of them have an equal right of ownership interest. They have a right to be there.

John Rogers: But… the moment I commit an ouster.

John Rogers: Is when the adverse possession clock starts.

John Rogers: kicking.

John Rogers: In order for me to claim adverse possession, There must be an ouster.

John Rogers: O-U-S.

John Rogers: T-E-R.

John Rogers: There must be an ouster.

John Rogers: So, if there's two tenants… One is adversely possessing, look for an ouster.

John Rogers: Because you cannot adversely possess a co-tenant absent an ouster, okay? Ousting the co-tenant.

John Rogers: Now… When someone If I have this La Jolla house, wheat.

John Rogers: We have a La Jolla house sticker.

John Rogers: And I oust you.

John Rogers: There's a concept called rent.

John Rogers: that I owe.

John Rogers: Which means that I owe you rental costs.

John Rogers: Because I am taking your interest. I'm taking up your interest. I'm not allowing you to have that interest. I'm not allowing you to enjoy your interest. So consequently, I owe you rent. R-E-N-T.

John Rogers: for the interest that I'm not allowing you to have.

John Rogers: So, for example, if… Rend is kind of a…

John Rogers: Arguable number, but let's suppose in… that, let's supposing…

John Rogers: That the reasonable rental value of this home is… is… \$10,000 a month.

John Rogers: I would owe you \$5,000.

John Rogers: the rental costs.

John Rogers: Rarely will you actually have facts that say that, so it is sufficient if you simply just say, owes this person rent, okay? It is sufficient just to say, owes this person rent.

John Rogers: Okay, so what you want to do is look for any facts that prevents someone from allowing another co-tenant.

John Rogers: Access to the property.

John Rogers: or makes some type of claim that you have no interest, but I'm the sole interest, that I'm the only interest. I have all the interest in the property, you don't.

John Rogers: So look for facts like that.

John Rogers: Okay? This was, tested… this is tested on the bar, as well as in this class.

John Rogers: Think of it like it was a joint tenancy discussion.

John Rogers: One of the joint tenants sold their interest to someone.

John Rogers: without telling.

John Rogers: And then the person who sold their interest died.

John Rogers: So the person that bought that interest went to the original Koten.

John Rogers: And wanted to talk to them.

John Rogers: And the original co-tenant says, I don't know who you are, I had this in joint tenancy. Get off my property. And then installed, no trespassing signs, erected a fence.

John Rogers: So that person, that original co-tenant, Is now oustering another tenant.

John Rogers: And that's when the adverse possession clock starts.

John Rogers: Tiki.

John Rogers: Poten its ouster.

John Rogers: Co-tenants, an ouster. Did an ouster occur?

John Rogers: Ousting kind of will come up in landlord-tenant, which we'll get into probably next week. Yes, hand raised.

Jude Seleck: Yeah, Professor, if, the Austin party, paying rent.

Jude Seleck: to the hosted party, the adverse, possession still…

Jude Seleck: starts, or it's not at first possession. But there's… it's no longer hostile, because he's paying,

Jude Seleck: share, his share of, I mean, rent.

John Rogers: That's fine, I still want access, though.

Jude Seleck: Okay.

Jude Seleck: Thank you.

John Rogers: Any questions on ouster? Very commonly tested. Oh, question! We have a question.

Amir Akbari: So the prerequisite for a start to getting your rent on the co-tenance is, having a ouster, right?

John Rogers: Yes.

Amir Akbari: And if it doesn't happen, but the co-tenant lived there, like, for the last 10 years, there is no obligation for paid rent.

John Rogers: Say that again?

Amir Akbari: I mean, if, the co-tenant, the other one, is, the, lived on the property for the last 10 years, but never paid the rent, and Ulster didn't happen.

Amir Akbari: Okay. There is no obligation for the rent, right?

John Rogers: No, I don't owe you… I wouldn't owe you any rent unless I ousted you.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, the requirement is when there is an uster.

John Rogers: Yes.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: And lastly, we're going to go into rents, payments, taxes, mortgage costs. This is a rabbit hole of an issue, and many… oh, question.

gevorg kulikyan: Yes, sorry, Professor. So for the rent situation, I'm a little confused. So, I oust somebody.

gevorg kulikyan: And I oust my co-tenant, and then I'm trying to adversely possess this property.

gevorg kulikyan: But I still have to pay…

gevorg kulikyan: That person rent at the same time.

John Rogers: And I can still…

gevorg kulikyan: Advertising.

John Rogers: The moment an ouster occurs, the moment you're gonna be owing rent to the co-tenant.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: Okay.

gevorg kulikyan: So it's like, if there's an ouster, there can be adverse possession, and rent needs to be paid.

John Rogers: Yes?

gevorg kulikyan: Okay.

gevorg kulikyan: Thank you, thank you.

John Rogers: Yes.

doven: So, they can't adversely possess the property like an actual adverse. They can't just take control.

doven: Okay, then.

John Rogers: They… there has to be an ouster.

John Rogers: For adverse possession to work.

doven: Okay.

doven: They pay the rent.

John Rogers: I mean, you could pay rent all you want, I mean, I could pay you all I want, but I'm still adversely possessing, because I'm still not honoring your interest.

John Rogers: I'm just doing what I'm legally supposed to do.

doven: But they… but they legally have to pay the ousted tenant rent.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: And if I'm not paying it, and the property is later sold, the ousted tenant can use that, get their share of the property, along with back due rent.

John Rogers: So, I kind of want to maybe remodel part of my house.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: I think I asked you guys this before, how much is a one-bedroom? I think someone said \$5,000. So if I wanted to rent a one-bedroom apartment.

John Rogers: \$5,000… is this a class that said \$5,000?

John Rogers: Oh, it is?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: There's no way it's \$5,000.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): That's about right.

Agnes Gholoonian: What area are you in?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Well, in bedroom? 5,000?

Sennett Devermont: Operations up.

Mireya Gonzalez: 2000.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: You're a little more.

John Rogers: images.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: Jeez.

Agnes Gholoonian: Average is 12…

Mireya Gonzalez: Or something decent.

John Rogers: 2,000? So, it doesn't matter, I'll live anywhere, I can live anywhere. I just…

Fatima Razavi: Alisa Viejo is \$2,500, I'm renting one of my condos for \$2,500.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Smart.

John Rogers: Well, until then, I just don't want an Airbnb.

John Rogers: I have some issues with Airbnb.

John Rogers: Well, being in someone else's property.

John Rogers: I always feel that there's no… variety to see there.

John Rogers: Wouldn't you be surreptitiously recording what's happening in your house when there's strangers there for a short period of time?

John Rogers: Right?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Right.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, absolutely.

John Rogers: So it's kind of…

John Rogers: Anyways…

John Rogers: So we're gonna get into… to rents.

John Rogers: profits… mortgages, taxes, and interest. So, what happens When?

John Rogers: You and me.

John Rogers: We have a piece of land together, we own property. Where's our property, La Jolla? Let's just think of La Jolla. La Jolla's a cool place.

John Rogers: We own… a piece of land in La Jolla.

John Rogers: But both of us… I moved to Western Australia, Perth, Australia. You moved to…

Aram Harutyunyan: Jamaica.

Aram Harutyunyan: Mmm.

John Rogers: And…

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Jamaica.

John Rogers: But you… Are using the property to grow marijuana.

John Rogers: and sell it.

John Rogers: to… You know, dispensaries.

John Rogers: And you're making \$10,000 a month.

John Rogers: If your profit Is derived from the use of our land.

John Rogers: I get some of that money.

John Rogers: I get 50% of them.

John Rogers: But it could be different, because what happens if, like, I own a virtual business.

John Rogers: And I only use our address in La Jolla for business purposes.

John Rogers: But there's no activity.

John Rogers: That's different, because… The income is not getting… is not derived from the use of the land.

John Rogers: That makes sense.

John Rogers: But if I start growing marijuana, I start digging for gold, and I find gold on our property.

John Rogers: Strike Oil? Yahoo!

John Rogers: 50-50, folks.

John Rogers: 50-50.

John Rogers: I'm sorry.

John Rogers: So, if there's…

John Rogers: If I… if I rent it out. So, I rent… I'm in Perth, Australia, but I rent out the La Jolla property.

John Rogers: And it's a house.

John Rogers: 4…

John Rogers: how much? A La Jolla house, let's say 4-bedroom, 4-bath house, let's say I'm gonna rent it out in La Jolla, \$20,000 a month.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: La Jolla?

John Rogers: Really cool place.

John Rogers: I rent it out. I… Have to split.

John Rogers: that \$20,000 with you, so you get 10, I get 10.

John Rogers: Make sense?

John Rogers: This is a bit of a rabbit hole, because this kind of… Slips through the cracks.

John Rogers: So, in regards to property taxes, and expenses?

John Rogers: The best way to think of it is each tenant is responsible for their own expenses. So think of it kind of like taxes, mortgage payments.

John Rogers: Upkeeping costs, just think 50-50.

John Rogers: Now, if I'm paying all of it.

John Rogers: I pay everything, and you're in Jamaica, Drinking booze on the beach.

John Rogers: But I'm paying all these charges of the property

John Rogers: I can later get reimbursed from you.

John Rogers: When we sell the property.

John Rogers: So if the property sells for \$100,000,

John Rogers: I would maybe get, like, \$60,000, you would get 40, For all the amount of…

John Rogers: payments and taxes and stuff like that I've paid.

John Rogers: So it's just reimbursement costs.

John Rogers: Now, when you're talking about, like, upkeeping costs, Or improvements, or, things that perhaps need repair.

John Rogers: Think of it as…

John Rogers: The co-tenants are not responsible for repairs or improvements unless there has been some form of an agreement between us.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: But again, if I pay improvement costs, I pay, costs for some repairs, I can always get reimbursed later on, if the property sells.

John Rogers: The problem with repairs and improvements is this.

John Rogers: Let's supposing… You're married.

John Rogers: Have you been in a situation, or maybe you're in a relationship now, serious relationship, married, whatever, doesn't matter.

John Rogers: And maybe you live with your significant other.

John Rogers: Has there ever been a situation where they, for example, would say, we need to get a new couch, and you say, couch is fine?

John Rogers: Or maybe you say the couch is fine, and they say, we need to get a new couch.

John Rogers: Is there ever that situation?

John Rogers: The sink is dirty. Looks fine to me.

John Rogers: No?

John Rogers: Yet?

Sennett Devermont: Yeah, so I think it's, like, subjective, the improvements, or the… What's needed, the repairs?

John Rogers: Yes, we need to repaint this place.

John Rogers: No, we don't.

John Rogers: We need to do this. No, we don't.

John Rogers: So, there could be differences of opinion, especially concerning the aesthetics of something.

John Rogers: Think of it like when you go out on a date or something. You're getting set up with Prince Charming, or you're being set up with a princess, and your friend says, oh my god, they're a 10, they're a 10, they're a 10, and you meet them, you're like, like a 7?

John Rogers: There's differences of opinion, right?

John Rogers: So… Consider that.

John Rogers: with improvements or repairs.

John Rogers: Is this necessary or not?

John Rogers: So that's how this works.

John Rogers: So that's why, unless there's some type of an agreement, there is no requirement.

John Rogers: But one of the parties can be reimbursed later on.

John Rogers: Make sense?

doven: So if they improve, and there's no agreement, they could still be reimbursed?

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Now, there are situations that are beyond the scope of this class, which is Real Property 3, and I'm hoping that everyone can convince the dean on Saturday to come up with Real Property 3 elective.

John Rogers: It's after real property, too.

John Rogers: You gotta come back a third semester.

John Rogers: You can just learn more property.

John Rogers: It would kind of be in situations where, could I claim reimbursement if it was really unnecessary improvements?

John Rogers: I figured we needed a fourth story, so I needed… and we needed an elevator. We needed an elevator in the house.

John Rogers: Okay, walk up the stairs. We needed an elevator.

John Rogers: I don't know about you guys, I need an elevator. I can't… I don't want to walk up the stairs like a peasant.

John Rogers: I need to be carried.

Amir Akbari: Is there any interest happen to that?

Amir Akbari: reimbursement, or if it's improving the property, the value of property?

John Rogers: Interesting.

John Rogers: I'm improving the value But that would only be significant in terms of sale.

John Rogers: improvements? I guess, yeah, you know what, you're right.

John Rogers: But it's not a necessary impudent.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: What if it comes to safety?

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: There's mold, and the guy doesn't want to replace it.

John Rogers: Well, we can hold your breath.

John Rogers: mold?

John Rogers: bold.

John Rogers: Mold.

John Rogers: That probably would be a necessary repair, I would assume, right?

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: I would assume so.

John Rogers: You know, I was… staying with my friend for a week when I was, like, in college.

John Rogers: And he had some contractor checking up his roof. We were like.

John Rogers: There's, like, 4 of them in a… in a house.

John Rogers: And this guy screams to the top of his lungs and runs out.

John Rogers: He's like, you have the worst mold problem I've ever seen.

John Rogers: And I'm sleeping on the couch, and the next day, we're, like, watching TV, and there's literally guys in his house. I felt like I was in E.T. There's people, like, in spacesuits talking to us through these things. And I'm thinking, where's… where's my suit, you know? Like, and I got something to worry about?

John Rogers: So, anyways… I don't think it affected me, but we'll see.

John Rogers: questions, because I have officially finished the lecture insofar as this chapter, so we will move into the casebook, but I want to address any questions you guys have.

John Rogers: Because with this, at this point, you can do 50% of the essay questions.

John Rogers: 50%.

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, in the… when we were talking about the adverse possession, With the ouster.

gevorg kulikyan: Since there was, like, a deed involved, or some sort of conveyance with paperwork, it would be constructive possession, right?

John Rogers: No?

John Rogers: So if I… if I ouster you.

gevorg kulikyan: Huh.

John Rogers: Yes.

gevorg kulikyan: And I adversely possess the property.

John Rogers: If you ouster me and you're adversely possessed with it, there's no issue of constructive possession. There's no color of title, nothing like that.

John Rogers: It potentially is if the land was physically divided, but it's not.

gevorg kulikyan: So the person that adversely possesses the property, they wouldn't get the whole property?

John Rogers: They would.

gevorg kulikyan: They would get all of it, right?

John Rogers: All of it.

gevorg kulikyan: Oh, well, what you're saying, it's, like, it's a non-issue, it doesn't matter at all.

John Rogers: I don't think it matters.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay.

Amir Akbari: But as long as he pays all the rent, right?

John Rogers: It's… or she.

Amir Akbari: She…

John Rogers: I mean, she pays… doesn't matter, paying rent or not, it's still an adverse possession. Here's your money, I'm still adversely possessing you.

Amir Akbari: But must pay, or no?

John Rogers: must pay rent.

John Rogers: Obligation to pay rent.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Can you give another example of how you ouster someone? I think I missed it in the… I get the concept, but can you give another example? Like, how would you do it? You just lock someone out?

John Rogers: Sure. It says, get out, I own this property, you don't have anything, get out. Or maybe I erect a fence with barbed wires around it and say, no trespassing.

John Rogers: I am the exclusive owner here. This is my property.

John Rogers: Or maybe I put a gun to you.

John Rogers: Fire a couple of rounds in your way and say, get out of here!

doven: So, if… if the ousted, tenant tries to sell it, he has to get half to the…

doven: Person he kicked out.

John Rogers: The ousted tenant? Or the…

doven: Oh, dear The one with the adverse, the adverse.

John Rogers: There's a co-tenancy, it must be split with the co-tenant.

John Rogers: Proceeds from a sale must be split with the co-tenant.

John Rogers: They have an interest.

Yessenia Soria: So why can't he just call the cops?

John Rogers: That's true.

Yessenia Soria: of.

John Rogers: Where's she?

Yessenia Soria: Or she, he, she, yeah.

John Rogers: Why can't they call the cops? That would actually be a pretty simple response.

John Rogers: They should call 911 and tell the cops, and then get their property back. Yeah.

John Rogers: Well, it's more civil, that's why. So police officers don't get involved, it's a civil dispute.

Yessenia Soria: Yeah, I'll let Toyota go to court.

John Rogers: I mean, I keep… sure, you go to court… civil court, but, I mean, police are law enforcement of the penal code, not…

John Rogers: Silk.

John Rogers: To add?

John Rogers: Yeah, go ahead.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: The adverse possession clock starts ticking as soon as he outs the person, right?

John Rogers: Where's she?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Or she… but if… what if that person takes legal action immediately? So does that pause the time?

John Rogers: Sure. Litigating an issue? Sure, why not?

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, if the person that was ousted sells their interest after they were ousted, the adverse possession clock resets until the new person gets ousted.

gevorg kulikyan: Nope.

John Rogers: No, it's not gonna get reset.

John Rogers: No way.

John Rogers: Reset, otherwise people would just be selling their property, and just adverse possession would be reset.

gevorg kulikyan: like, let's say I got ousted.

gevorg kulikyan: I was like, alright, whatever, I don't want to deal with this, and I want to sell my interest, let the.

John Rogers: Help someone else, then they are stepping in.

gevorg kulikyan: They step in, and the clock still remains the same.

John Rogers: Yes, but there might be some notice requirements for that, for them, which we will get into next semester.

John Rogers: And that is disclosing issues, so that a new buyer is not stepping into litigation, because that's something that they'd want to know about.

gevorg kulikyan: Indeed.

Amir Akbari: But, Daniel…

John Rogers: That's true.

Amir Akbari: The new owner has a color of rights, right?

Amir Akbari: Color of title here.

Amir Akbari: No.

John Rogers: It was not an issue.

Amir Akbari: If the new owner buys from the, other pr- other person?

Amir Akbari: It's not color of title?

John Rogers: There's nothing defective about it, is it?

John Rogers: I'm selling you my interest.

John Rogers: 50%, but there's no line drawn, it's undivided, it's just 50% of the interest of the property.

John Rogers: There's no line drawn.

Yessenia Soria: So, bottom line, just buy yourself a house with nobody else, right?

John Rogers: So you go… oh, my God, that would save a lot of headaches. There you go! Yes!

John Rogers: Yes, you need to start hating people more, okay? There you go.

Mireya Gonzalez: Professor, I have another question.

John Rogers: Yes, Judge Beerstein.

Mireya Gonzalez: I understand how partition and expenses are relations among the concurrent owners. I'm not understanding how an ouster is a relation among them, because isn't that necessarily not always, like.

Mireya Gonzalez: doesn't always apply. Like, I'm… I'm confused on where that connects with relations among the concurrent owners.

John Rogers: I'm not sure I'm understanding the question.

John Rogers: So, what exactly is the question?

Mireya Gonzalez: how that is a relation… how ousters are relations among them. Is that something that could possibly apply? Is that why? I'm not understanding on how that's a relation among them? Like, I… I get what an ouster is, but I'm not sure as far as it relating among

Mireya Gonzalez: the concurrent owners. Like, if that's necessary, necessarily required.

John Rogers: So, if there's a co-tenancy, okay?

John Rogers: Right?

Mireya Gonzalez: Right.

John Rogers: And… You're saying, how does an ouster relate to the co-tenancy?

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes, like, how is it a relation among them, among those owners?

John Rogers: I mean, an ouster is kind of… An ouster is…

John Rogers: did one of the co-tenants commit an ouster? It's not…

John Rogers: in relation, so it's not… it's not, existing. I mean, it's… someone has to commit an ouster, just like I'd have to commit a battery against someone.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay.

Mireya Gonzalez: I think I got it.

John Rogers: It's just… It's kind of a… it's not a remedy, but it's a situation in a way.

Mireya Gonzalez: possible situation.

John Rogers: commits the ouster, then it… things get triggered.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: There's so many people that you're just… your voice would bring me… it'd be like love language to me. I could just hear your voice.

John Rogers: Man.

John Rogers: Any… any other questions?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: The person that does the ouster to the other co-tenant, can they just go to… go and get a partition, and make the judge decide what they do?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Am I right about that? Either go partition a kind, partition of sales, to say, hey, I got kicked… I got kicked out, but I want to take a partition action.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: To figure out what we should do.

John Rogers: Potentially could do that.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Why not?

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: I don't think we're gonna get very far if we go into the book right now.

John Rogers: Wanna do an essay?

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes, please.

Alice Orozco: Thank you, guys!

Karen Hernandez: Yes.

John Rogers: Tell me which one you want, Leo.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Something with estates.

doven: Be simple, or…

gevorg kulikyan: I think number 16 has the ouster and all of that, Professor.

John Rogers: Okay, we can do that if you want.

John Rogers: Let me pull it up.

John Rogers: I have no quartz blossoms. No.

John Rogers: No, I have no court.

John Rogers: I'm so happy. I'm gonna go to… I'm gonna go to sleep tonight, so happy.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: So we should call with all our questions tomorrow, please?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: It's a good deed.

John Rogers: But I did get news today that one of my clients in federal custody is getting transferred to a facility near the border of Mexico.

doven: Julie…

John Rogers: I'm gonna have to go see my girl down in southern… southern California.

John Rogers: We can do 16 if you want, doesn't matter to me. Seems very basic.

Amir Akbari: Can we do the conveyance?

Amir Akbari: like…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Yes, please.

John Rogers: To weed.

John Rogers: Do you want to do 16 or not? Like, I mean, I'll do anything you guys want. You just tell me.

Amir Akbari: The hard ones, please.

John Rogers: Which one's hard? Tell me, which one's hard. I don't think they're…

Amir Akbari: The mixed ones, the, like, adverse position and the conveyance, hybrid one.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: there was a woman that used to teach this class named Michelle Tobankin.

John Rogers: Michelle Tobankin.

John Rogers: She's probably on social media somewhere, you can follow her. She's really sweet and cool.

John Rogers: She used to teach this class.

John Rogers: When I started teaching, she was teaching, and then she retired, and then Safarian came.

John Rogers: But… she wrote question number 4, which is, I like that a lot, but I think it's a…

John Rogers: We, we can do that. It's, it's common law.

John Rogers: But… Cheese?

John Rogers: She knew her stuff very well.

John Rogers: So find her on social media and follow her.

John Rogers: You can also find my former student, Nikki Razapur.

John Rogers: As well. She's a very good, and you can DM her, and…

John Rogers: Say that you need help on property.

John Rogers: Do that, too.

doven: What's a girlfriend name?

John Rogers: No, I'm not gonna serenade now. You gotta listen to the recording.

John Rogers: Because she's gonna text me, she's like, hey, what happened? I have, like, 10 people that just started following me.

John Rogers: I'm like, I don't know. I don't know what happened.

John Rogers: She's gonna know.

John Rogers: Take a question. I think number 4 is challenging.

Amir Akbari: Good, can we do it, please?

doven: or four.

John Rogers: Yeah, it's challenging, but you guys want to do something that challenging right off the bat, or do you want to do something a little bit more easier?

John Rogers: I'll do whatever you guys want.

doven: Oh my god.

John Rogers: You guys, I would love to hear from someone who I… I don't know their voice.

John Rogers: So, if I get a phone call, and they say, hi, this is so-and-so, I'd be like, I don't know this voice.

Daniel Sinanian: Can you do something challenging, especially with Edward's possession?

John Rogers: I don't know what is challenging with someone, not me.

John Rogers: Pick a question, and we'll do it. And if I don't want to do that particular question, I will tell you I don't want to do that question. But just pick one, whatever you guys think is tough.

Mireya Gonzalez: We can just go with the one you said, question number 4.

John Rogers: Fine.

Daniel Sinanian: Or do this one, do number 6, it's a big essay, with 3 questions.

John Rogers: That's… That's landlord-tenant.

John Rogers: Can't do number 6, that's landlord-tenant.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Number 5 is good, too.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You think?

doven: Custom number 4.

John Rogers: Oh, Wonder Acre. Oh, it's in Alice in Wonderland.

John Rogers: I don't care. Whatever you guys want.

Alice Orozco: Let's just do 4.

John Rogers: Come on, let's go.

John Rogers: State of Olympia. This is Tabankan for sure. Common law! This is definitely Tabankan.

John Rogers: Michelle Tobangen.

John Rogers: Mad Acre.

John Rogers: Is this… Ave Acre?

John Rogers: Okay? Mad Acre, Madacre, Ave Acre.

John Rogers: Oh, okay.

John Rogers: I always read the interrogatories first, okay? And…

John Rogers: This is just how I do things.

John Rogers: And it might help you, it might not.

John Rogers: But let me tell you something.

John Rogers: Back in the olden days, when people took real final exams, okay?

John Rogers: Similar to what you're gonna do on the bar exam, a real exam.

John Rogers: I spend a lot of time engorging myself in the question.

John Rogers: So, I actually don't start writing for, like, 25 minutes.

John Rogers: But then I look around, and I see all these people have these pages of things, and I think to myself.

John Rogers: these… Idiots don't know what they just missed.

John Rogers: So, I get that confidence.

John Rogers: So I read very slow, and I'm very analytical when it comes to this. So please bear with me, okay?

John Rogers: And I read very slowly, look at the significance of everything. So, 11 years ago, okay, so if it's 11 years, it's a common law fact pattern. 11 years ago, so it's been 11 years, I'm assuming that that's

John Rogers: triggering because of an adverse possession claim? Don't know. It just says 11 years ago. Roger. Okay, no S.

John Rogers: was the fee-simple owner of Madacre? Okay, so that tells me that what's the first issue? The first issue is going to be fee-simple Absolutes. Notice how every fact pattern begins with this. This is a foundational fact, just to establish what does Roger have.

John Rogers: Now, I don't particularly like this, because R, I usually begin with O. Olive, Oliver. Owner.

John Rogers: Whatever's easier that way.

John Rogers: a large parcel of land in the state of Olympia. So this is a large parcel. If it's large.

John Rogers: The only reason it would say large is because maybe there's an adverse possession claim, and maybe someone's only using part of it, maybe it's not noticeable. I don't know, it just says large.

John Rogers: or Large? Maybe it's French?

John Rogers: It just says that. So, okay. I don't know the significance of that, but maybe I'll just, you know, put it in my brain somewhere. In the state of Olympia, which I've never been to, don't ever care about going, Madacre

John Rogers: Okay, was improved with a home, so that's improved

John Rogers: with a home, and an award-winning rose garden. I definitely did not do this. This is a Tibankan, she loves roses.

John Rogers: A rose-winning garden.

John Rogers: With a home, okay?

John Rogers: Where is the significance of that right now?

Amir Akbari: improved.

Amir Akbari: And it's, to communicate.

John Rogers: Roger sold Maddie.

Amir Akbari: show.

John Rogers: Rogers sold me, so O… to D, in feet.

John Rogers: So Don has something in fee, because it's to Don and his heirs. For so long as Madagascar Garden is maintained.

John Rogers: and if Medicare Garden is not maintained, grantor has the right to re-enter and retake the property.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Condition subsequent?

Fatima Razavi: Conditional.

John Rogers: This is how I would analyze it.

John Rogers: So, it's in fee, it's gonna be a fee-simple, in my opinion, a fee-simple… Subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: In my opinion. Because what is the…

John Rogers: Controlling language here is the right to re-enter and retake, which occurs upon a breach.

John Rogers: But we do notice here it says, so long as.

John Rogers: Which is evidence of the determinable estate.

John Rogers: I think that it's more controlling of the remedy upon breach.

John Rogers: Than this language here.

John Rogers: So I would say that this is a fee-simple.

John Rogers: be simple subject to a condition subsequent, and consequently, Roger has a right of entry, okay?

John Rogers: Don moved on, sort of so long as it's maintained.

John Rogers: So long as the Mad Acre Garden is maintained.

John Rogers: No problem. Don moved on to Blackacre with his wife, Betty.

John Rogers: Hi, Betty.

John Rogers: So we moved on with good ol' Betty.

John Rogers: Don and Betty's marital troubles continued in spite of the new home, and Don soon moved back to the big city.

John Rogers: Sorry to hear that.

John Rogers: Okay. Now, notice here it says to Don and his heirs. Sure, okay.

John Rogers: But it's just so long as the Madacre Garden is maintained, not that Dawn maintains the Madacre Garden.

John Rogers: Don transferred Okay, so he took Matt Aker to Betty.

John Rogers: for so long as she lives on Madacre and does not remarry.

John Rogers: Going on here?

John Rogers: What is that?

Amir Akbari: Restraint of marriage?

John Rogers: Yeah.

doven: So this is the restraint of marriage.

John Rogers: Yeah, what else?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Be simple, determinable?

John Rogers: Close… It's a… Determinable.

John Rogers: Life estate. How do we know that? Because it's too betty. This is common law.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Right.

John Rogers: So…

doven: If it was modern-law, what would it be? What would you say?

John Rogers: It's not common law, that'd be a fee.

John Rogers: So, 2Betty, which is determined, which is, a life.

John Rogers: So it's for the life and being, Betty's a life and being. For so long as, that's…

John Rogers: duration of language, as she lives on that acre and does not remarry. So it's a determinable life estate, and there's also a, restraint on marriage. Now, what do you guys think about that?

John Rogers: This restraint on marriage.

Amir Akbari: We should take out that part.

John Rogers: I don't think so, because if we look at our casebook, and we look at restraint on marriage.

John Rogers: you will notice that that section, which I read out loud, to the class.

John Rogers: That says that durational Is… is there to evidence support until marriage?

John Rogers: And on condition that is more language to penalize marriage.

John Rogers: So, Don's… Transfer to Betty.

John Rogers: Is not to penalize her if she remarries.

John Rogers: But rather, support her until she remarries.

John Rogers: Make sense?

John Rogers: this…

Amir Akbari: It means there is an intent, like, a good faith, something, like…

John Rogers: That's my position on this.

John Rogers: But… I don't think Tobankin was that… Deep into this.

John Rogers: As long as she… here's the thing.

John Rogers: Does not remarry. Okay, that's fine. I don't see an issue.

John Rogers: If we look in our casebook, if you go to Restraint on Marriage, which I don't even know where that is, but hold on…

John Rogers: If we go on page 318 and 319 of your casebook, Read. That.

John Rogers: I read that out loud to you.

John Rogers: ALL. I read that out loud to you. In fact, I'm very confident it's probably in my notes, too, but I'm not sure.

John Rogers: So, I don't usually like to just say things out loud and waste my oxygen, unless I thought it was important.

John Rogers: Betty, annoyed by the sight of the roses… I hate roses, too, they're awful. Barf. They're just ugly, huh?

John Rogers: Removed all the rose bushes.

John Rogers: So the question is, is that a breach?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yes.

John Rogers: She planted a variety of flowers and plants in the space formerly occupied by the rose bushes.

John Rogers: So does that breach.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I believe so.

John Rogers: Why?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Because it was supposed to be maintained, not… Cut out and replaced.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: By different roses.

John Rogers: But it didn't say, maintain the rose garden, it just says the Mad Acre Garden.

John Rogers: So, is she not still gardening?

Jude Seleck: Is it waste?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: No, but it says maintain… What's a Homan and Warden?

John Rogers: So long as the Madigor.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Pardon is linked.

John Rogers: Is that a bridge?

Amir Akbari: I don't think so.

John Rogers: Well, you have one…

John Rogers: We have one person that says it is a breach, you have one person that says it isn't.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, because the purpose is the garden. If it changed to the other, like a garage, yeah.

Amir Akbari: As long as he… He does the… or she does the.

John Rogers: Jeez.

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

Amir Akbari: The garden, that's… Fine.

Mireya Gonzalez: If anything, she improved the garden by maintaining it and adding more.

Mireya Gonzalez: flowers.

John Rogers: Sounds like Judge Garst Diggy.

Sennett Devermont: But it does say it was an award-winning garden, rose garden, so I feel like maybe…

Sennett Devermont: If it's an award-winning rose garden, it's different than a normal garden… any garden.

John Rogers: Yeah, maybe it kind of… it's expected that it would be the Rose Garden, because it's in a…

John Rogers: An award-winning garden.

John Rogers: An award-winning rose garden.

Jude Seleck: A kind of, like, loss of value.

John Rogers: I seem to think, and I can't hold it against you, I just seem to think that it's not a breach, in my opinion, because it just says Madacre Garden is maintained. There still is…

John Rogers: a garden on Madacre.

John Rogers: And it is being… Maintained by Betty.

John Rogers: So… Whatever. But I can't hold it against you if you say that's a breach. Can't.

John Rogers: So… just… Listen to your heart.

John Rogers: But notice here, Dawn is going to have a possibility of reverter, too.

John Rogers: Because it's determinable life.

John Rogers: So Dawn will have a possibility for birth.

John Rogers: For the last 10 years, Betty has maintained the space with many types of of plants and flowers.

John Rogers: Now, it sounds like this. If Betty

John Rogers: First off, if that's a breach.

John Rogers: then if it's a condition subsequent, which I see.

John Rogers: adverse possession wouldn't be triggered until Roger and Roger's heirs exercised that.

John Rogers: Last year, Roger became engaged to Jane. Boy, there was no divorce, was there?

John Rogers: What happened?

John Rogers: Oh, no!

John Rogers: Roger became engaged to Jane.

John Rogers: Roger, the fee-simple owner of Avacre, which is not Madacre, it's a different one.

John Rogers: Also, in the state of Olympia, Never go there.

John Rogers: Properly executed a deed. Okay.

John Rogers: You see this language right here, properly executed a deed, or sometimes you say valid, sometimes it will say valid deed in these questions.

John Rogers: It's… I only include that, and my former counterpart, Michelle Tobankin.

John Rogers: Put that, too, in there, and that's to prevent students

John Rogers: From questioning the validity of a deed, which is second semester.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: Granting Avacre as follows. I, Roger, grant all my right, interest, title, and Avacre to Roger and Jane as joint owners

John Rogers: With the right of survivorship.

doven: Whatever issue that he's still married?

John Rogers: Well, first off.

John Rogers: Yeah, I'm kind of interested in the drama with that. I'd like to know. What's the T, you know? You would discuss creation of a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: for Unities. But the problem… There's a problem here. What's the problem?

gevorg kulikyan: Do you need a straw man.

Karen Hernandez: Strongman.

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: No straw man.

doven: They need a lawyer.

John Rogers: Yeah, yeah, of course, yes, we do need a lawyer, yes. We're a strong man.

John Rogers: So, there is no straw man, so it's not going to be an effective grant of a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: There's no joint tenancy here.

John Rogers: So Roger and Jane ain't joint tenants.

John Rogers: Because there's no straw man.

John Rogers: Roger died shortly thereafter. That's really sad. I hope, like, family gave him flowers?

John Rogers: Roger's valid will. There we go, valid, valid, valid, valid. This prevents the students from arguing the validity of the will. Judge Varastigi has a question.

Mireya Gonzalez: Can… sorry to backtrack, but can you go back to the… the straw man, why there is no straw man?

John Rogers: Where's the strongman?

Mireya Gonzalez: I don't know, that's where I'm confused.

John Rogers: Well, under the common law, In order to create a joint tenancy in yourself and someone else.

John Rogers: In order to do that, you can't already own it. You need to use a third party, where you convey the land of the third party, and they re-execute it back to you and Jane. That way, all the four unities are present. You accept title at the same time, same instrument, etc.

doven: In modern law, they don't have to do that.

John Rogers: Modern law, they don't have to do that. iPhone law, they don't have to do that.

Mireya Gonzalez: Thank you.

John Rogers: Roger's valid will, so it says valid just to prevent the cowboys and cowgirl students from questioning the validity of the will, which is not an issue for semester, left his real property interest to Jane.

John Rogers: Oh.

John Rogers: Okay, so this is useless. Okay, so I'm giving Jane… for her life, Cheetah.

John Rogers: Oh! Alright, let's break it down.

John Rogers: Then it goes to Jane for life, then to any issue of Roger, who survived Jane.

John Rogers: And if no issue of Roger, so as to survive, to be Peggy and her heirs.

John Rogers: Alternative Contingent remainder.

doven: And this is an alternative remainder?

John Rogers: Certainly looks like it.

John Rogers: So what would Jane have?

doven: Life will stay.

John Rogers: Yeah, so Jane would have a present possessory interest in a life estate, right?

John Rogers: with…

John Rogers: J being the measuring life, right? So then any… then to any issue of Roger, who survived Jane, I don't think Roger had any issue at all. Think of children, right?

John Rogers: That's a contingent remainder.

John Rogers: Is that a typo?

doven: We were supposed to learn alternative remainder, I put it down, but…

John Rogers: No, we didn't, because I didn't think I was going to come across it. Then to any issue of Roger.

John Rogers: This is a little bit of a problem for me here, because here's the thing, I think this is a typo.

John Rogers: I think that it's all gonna be valid, but the problem here is I think it's a typo, because it says, then to any issue of Roger who survived Jane, but it doesn't say then to any issue of Roger and their heirs.

John Rogers: who survived Jane.

John Rogers: So this tells me it would be a contingent remainder in life.

John Rogers: weird, and then it says, Peggy also has… An alternative contingent remainder.

John Rogers: valid.

John Rogers: The alternative contingent remainder.

John Rogers: Which I didn't even…

John Rogers: Which I didn't even teach, to be honest. So who says that in the issue of Roger, and if no issue of Roger, so… no, it's valid, it's all valid, this is all gonna be valid, and then Roger, or his heirs…

John Rogers: We'll have a reversion.

John Rogers: All valid. Rule against perpetuities, valid to everyone.

John Rogers: Now, if you found that this… Issue of the home.

John Rogers: Taking out the garden.

John Rogers: is a breach.

John Rogers: then you'd… may have to discuss adverse possession, but I just don't see it.

John Rogers: The only reason is because no one is asserting their right, so the adverse possession clock hasn't even started yet.

John Rogers: So no one on behalf of Roger

John Rogers: is trying to come in and take the land from Dawn.

John Rogers: But I don't really think that this was that hard.

John Rogers: I think a lot of the Tabankan questions are a little bit… she's very old school, very old school.

John Rogers: And… They're tough, but they're not too hard.

John Rogers: What'd you guys think of this one?

doven: A little hard, but more…

John Rogers: It is 920. It is 920. You are free to leave. You guys are free to go and do about whatever you want.

doven: Give us that paper.

John Rogers: Which one?

doven: The one at the beginning with the bar.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: So just a heads up, I will, here, I'll just put it in the chat.

John Rogers: So, for Saturday, it'll probably be at 1.30, so I'll probably be doing property at maybe 3. I'm gonna do evidence beforehand.

John Rogers: What is the date today? 10-9?

John Rogers: I'm gonna do evidence beforehand, so probably about 3 o'clock is when I'll start doing property.

John Rogers: The only reason I'm only doing it is to help my evidence class, because there's no mentor, but I had to make it fair and make it available for property as well.

doven: You mind if I call you afterwards, just for a second?

John Rogers: You know, someone just said, eat leaves outside, and that is absolutely correct.

John Rogers: That is absolutely correct. Eat leaves outside.

John Rogers: Because my doctor says that a lot of problems will be solved in your life just by eating leaves outside. So make sure the sun hits your skin while you're eating leaves.

John Rogers: Okay? Solve a lot of problems.

John Rogers: Otherwise, maybe you'll see you Saturday, maybe I won't, maybe I'll see you next Thursday.

John Rogers: Have a wonderful weekend.

John Rogers: That's it. I'll stick around if you guys have any questions.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor, what time is the thing again for evidence?

John Rogers: Oh, probably 1.30.

Agnes Gholoonian: And then how do I sign… do I email you, and you'll send us a link, or how does that work?

John Rogers: I'll send you guys a link. It's a private Zoom. It's my private, it's not to the school. It will…

John Rogers: Just look out for an email, because I'm sending it to Evidence and Property.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay, sounds good. Thank you so much.

Agnes Gholoonian: You said 1.30? Sorry.

Agnes Gholoonian: 1.30? Thank you.

Agnes Gholoonian: Goodbye, have a good night.

doven: Faster.

doven: I study a lot with the FC symbol, and I just, like.

doven: goes to one ear, and then out the other. You have any suggestions?

John Rogers: Well, first off, this is not supposed to be easy, and no one ever says that this is easy.

John Rogers: So the fact that you're having trouble, and it's very difficult for you, It's okay.

John Rogers: You're not alone.

John Rogers: The only thing that really I think can help you is just… Repetition.

John Rogers: Just keep doing, keep dead.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: You'll start seeing patterns.

doven: Thank you.

Karen Hernandez: Professor, I have a question. In the essay, when you said there was a determinable life estate.

John Rogers: Yeah. And you said there's a possibility of reverter?

Karen Hernandez: Wouldn't it be reversion because it's in life?

John Rogers: Well, you're right. It's both. It would be a reversion and a possibility reverse. I stand…

Karen Hernandez: Okay.

John Rogers: Good job.

Karen Hernandez: Okay, so if I would put reversion, I wouldn't get… I wouldn't get it wrong.

John Rogers: You would only get half of it right.

Karen Hernandez: Okay.

Karen Hernandez: Can you explain why it's both?

John Rogers: Well, there is a concept called reversionary interest, which…

John Rogers: I don't really ever expect anyone to write it, and it's a combination of multiple future interests held by the grantor.

John Rogers: I don't care, so I'd rather you just put there's a reversion and a possibility of reverberger.

John Rogers: Good catch.

Karen Hernandez: Okay.

John Rogers: Okay.

Karen Hernandez: Okay, thank you.

Yessenia Soria: Thank you, Professor. Have a good weekend. Stay safe.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Thank you, Professor. Enjoy your weekend.

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, quick question.

John Rogers: Is this property, or is this criminal law, or what is this?

gevorg kulikyan: Property, property. Property.

John Rogers: Alright, fine.

gevorg kulikyan: I'll ask you some criminal afterwards.

gevorg kulikyan: What?

gevorg kulikyan: So, if somebody is adversely possessing the property after ousting someone else, and they don't pay the rent, pay them rent, can they still adversely possess it?

John Rogers: True.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay.

gevorg kulikyan: Because that's, like, I think that's an issue on that, on question 16.

gevorg kulikyan: Says Oliver and Deb have never taken any action against Bob's possession of Blackacre after they were out.

John Rogers: Okay.

gevorg kulikyan: Nope.

gevorg kulikyan: he would have…

John Rogers: Just sat on their rights.

gevorg kulikyan: Got it.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay, cool.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: They would get their… they would get the rental later down the line if there was a sale.

John Rogers: I guess so, because they would be able to probably put a lien on the property.

John Rogers: I would assume so.

Sennett Devermont: I was looking for the part where,

Sennett Devermont: If it's the joint tenants… and then, you mentioned gold, like, mining gold, and then the other tenant is…

Sennett Devermont: 50%, we get 50% of it.

John Rogers: Yep.

Sennett Devermont: And then if it was, like, you were using the land for, like, your office space, they wouldn't, right?

John Rogers: Yeah.

Sennett Devermont: Possibly not good.

John Rogers: They derived from the land.

Sennett Devermont: But then you mentioned the marijuana grow, and that's not like it would be naturally there, right? Like, you would buy seeds and then just…

Sennett Devermont: It's not really, like, utilizing the resources underneath, is it?

John Rogers: But it still is derived from the use of the land.

Sennett Devermont: Okay, so then, in that example, if it was a marijuana grow with a company, and that company was paying rent, like, normal market rate rent to the…

Sennett Devermont: to… tenants, They wouldn't split the rent, they would split the profits of the weed, of the marijuana grow?

John Rogers: Profits are only when one of the tenants is deriving profit profit from this property. If they have a tenant.

John Rogers: Like, a third party that they're leasing to, they split it 50-50, or in proportion to how much they own.

Sennett Devermont: Well, if one of the tenants owns a business that's renting it, like… For example, I… yeah.

John Rogers: Yeah, I… so… so I am a co-tenant. I have a business

John Rogers: And my business is renting it?

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: No, I've never seen it. Typically, in my… I've only seen…

John Rogers: They're just leasing it to a third party for rent, or they're operating their own business.

Sennett Devermont: Okay, no, thank you.

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, does a lien holder have a future possessory interest?

John Rogers: I don't know, you… I guess, yeah, sure.

gevorg kulikyan: So if something was done to the property, that goes… Against the value of it.

gevorg kulikyan: Then the doctrine of waste would kick in for the lien holder.

John Rogers: I'm not sure.

John Rogers: I don't think the lien holder has a…

John Rogers: has an interest. I wouldn't say future interest.

John Rogers: Because I wouldn't know what type of future interest. They have an interest, though. There's a lien on it.

John Rogers: But I don't think a lien holder has a say on The activities of the property.

gevorg kulikyan: It's like… What I'm thinking is, like, so the mortgage.

gevorg kulikyan: So the bank…

gevorg kulikyan: has a certain say in what you can do and can't do to the property. Like, let's say my property burned down, and I just never fixed it again. The bank is gonna have a problem with that.

John Rogers: Well, see, the thing is, is beforehand, you execute agreements with the bank.

gevorg kulikyan: We used a lien holder.

John Rogers: So, if I sue you, and I win in a car accident, and I put a lien on your property.

John Rogers: Like, well, can I tell you what you can do on your own property? No.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, okay.

gevorg kulikyan: But if I were to, like, refinance my house, the house is paid off and I refinance.

gevorg kulikyan: Is the…

John Rogers: That's still the same thing like a mortgage.

gevorg kulikyan: It's not… Oh yeah, they could foreclose on it.

gevorg kulikyan: So it's not the same thing as, like, a lien holder.

gevorg kulikyan: I'll let everybody else get their questions in on, property. I have one for… Criminal procedure.

John Rogers: Oh.

Amir Akbari: Do you have a time, 5 minutes, to issue a spot this essay that we did on the…

Amir Akbari: A mentor session?

Amir Akbari: Because I want to see your thought process.

John Rogers: I can do it on, on, canada, if you will.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, but we did it already, I don't wanna…

Amir Akbari: I wanna have a new one.

Amir Akbari: On Saturday, because they already recorded, and everybody has.

John Rogers: We'll do both.

Amir Akbari: Okay, sounds good.

John Rogers: Or I'll do it next class.

Amir Akbari: Anytime.

Amir Akbari: Thank you so much.

John Rogers: We'll do it.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, because it was, honestly, there are steps, and, sometimes you feel like how to…

Amir Akbari: prioritize their steps, and then… because it could change the end result, then your conclusion, maybe?

Amir Akbari: Different, yeah, I… But it was hard. It wasn't, like, that question for…

John Rogers: It's not gonna be hard in comparison to… once you go over a bunch of exams, you're gonna look back at that exam and say, that's not very hard.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, and no, the one that, it's for last year's exam.

Amir Akbari: It was harder than this question 4.

John Rogers: Last year's exam.

Amir Akbari: Let me send it.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

Mireya Gonzalez: I do.

Mireya Gonzalez: For the essay that we just went over, well, this might take longer, so I may have to meet with you tomorrow if I can, considering you don't have to go to court.

Mireya Gonzalez: My… is my formation, like, how to structure the essay. We haven't gone over property in my legal writing class just yet, so I'm… I kind of just want to know how to structure it, because

Mireya Gonzalez: Ultimately, it's a little different from a diversive possession.

Mireya Gonzalez: So I just want to see if I could potentially go over formation with you.

John Rogers: Yeah, I mean, I sent you prior student final exams, too, you got those, right?

Mireya Gonzalez: Oh, yeah, I have them. More so, because I like the way your thought process is, I like the way you go through it, it helps me understand it versus just, like, reading it by myself.

John Rogers: Do you have your book with you right now?

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes.

John Rogers: Let me see it.

Mireya Gonzalez: Well, I have it downloaded. The one I have physically is the wrong edition, so it's kind of…

John Rogers: I thought you were gonna say that you have those…

Mireya Gonzalez: all the papers.

John Rogers: when it made.

Mireya Gonzalez: No, I stopped doing that once you stop providing it online, or else I would have it.

John Rogers: Okay.

Mireya Gonzalez: So I can meet with you?

John Rogers: Yeah, you totally can, you can call me, just text me tomorrow.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay, for sure. Okay, thank you, have a good night.

John Rogers: So, CrimPro now? Doing a CrimPro question?

gevorg kulikyan: Unless… Anybody else has a question?

John Rogers: You know, CrimPro, let's hear it.

gevorg kulikyan: It's a very quick and easy one.

John Rogers: Oh, let's see if it didn't here.

gevorg kulikyan: So, pre-indictment…

John Rogers: Okay.

gevorg kulikyan: Jailhouse Snitches.

John Rogers: Okay?

gevorg kulikyan: my problem. So, pre-indictment, the government is allowed to put a jailhouse snitch after they've read Miranda.

gevorg kulikyan: And you have… invoked your rights.

John Rogers: That's Perkins.

John Rogers: Absolutely.

John Rogers: If that was illegal, Half of the gang murders would go unsolved.

John Rogers: So you invoke Miranda? No problem. They just stick you in a cell with an undercover or a confidential informant?

John Rogers: You just blabber to them, and boom, there you go.

John Rogers: But the moment that you make the appearance, Sixth Amendment applies.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay, so let's say it's a kid.

gevorg kulikyan: Like, an 18-year-old, first-time.

John Rogers: Adult?

gevorg kulikyan: Criminal. Yeah, still, like, first time in jail, they've never been to jail, okay, and then they're…

gevorg kulikyan: In a cell with a jailhouse snitch.

John Rogers: Okay, presented.

gevorg kulikyan: I feel like that's coercive.

gevorg kulikyan: Is it not?

John Rogers: Fine.

gevorg kulikyan: Because… The kid's talking to the snitch.

gevorg kulikyan: Most likely because they're scared to get beat up. Or hurt.

John Rogers: yeah, they're boasting to try to build a reputation so no one messes with them. Happens all the time. But is that supposed to then deem it inadmissible in general, or is the criminal defendant given the opportunity at trial to say that they didn't mean what they said?

gevorg kulikyan: So they could redact their statement?

John Rogers: Well, it's not necessarily redacting, but…

John Rogers: when something is a coercive environment, I mean…

John Rogers: The judge has to determine that, and the judge is never going to say that that's coercive.

John Rogers: No one's threatening them. No one's putting a gun to their… their head.

John Rogers: So… the criminal defendant at their trial can argue, I didn't mean what I said.

John Rogers: I was just boasting, and… You know, trying to look hard.

John Rogers: But it's not going to…

John Rogers: I mean, unless it's forceful, so unless the confidential informant, you know, starts beating them up and trying to get information out of them, and there you go, you have a

John Rogers: Coercive, involuntary statement.

John Rogers: Absent that, Okay, it's coming.

gevorg kulikyan: Like, in practice, the jailhouse snitches that the police put into the holding cell, they still have, like, certain restrictions, right? Just so they don't have an issue on their case.

John Rogers: Well, they'll usually not initiate the conversation.

John Rogers: Okay.

Sennett Devermont: That's why you don't talk in the tank, right?

John Rogers: You don't talk to anybody.

John Rogers: Anybody? You don't talk on the phone either.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, no, I… I mean, I feel like for a normal, thinking, adult criminal, that would be okay, but I'm thinking more of, like, a 17, 18-year-old inside of a holding cell. They're going to make that mistake, and I…

John Rogers: 17 is different.

John Rogers: But 18, you're an adult.

gevorg kulikyan: 17 different.

John Rogers: Because you'd be treated as a minor, and certain rights apply to minors.

gevorg kulikyan: I'm not sure as far as criminal procedure is concerned.

John Rogers: Generally you… like, in California, if you ever engage in questioning.

John Rogers: You have to notify the parents.

John Rogers: For a buyer.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay.

gevorg kulikyan: Alright, I think… now, I took your advice. I, applied to the PD's office.

John Rogers: Oh, did you?

gevorg kulikyan: It's the clerk.

John Rogers: Oh, really? Did you… did you get, get to choose where.

gevorg kulikyan: No, I just did my interview. They interviewed me, like, a couple days ago.

John Rogers: Who interviewed you?

gevorg kulikyan: Let me see… his name was Klick?

gevorg kulikyan: Something glick, I think, let me check.

gevorg kulikyan: Travis Glick.

gevorg kulikyan: It's the volunteer clerkship.

Sennett Devermont: And we can do that while we're in law school?

John Rogers: Yeah, of course!

Sennett Devermont: What if we're on diversion?

John Rogers: If you're on diversion, then I don't see a problem. Public defender's office, who knows?

John Rogers: There's a student in my evidence class that's a certified law student that's been arguing bail hearings for the Public Defender's Office.

John Rogers: Yeah, I don't know who Glick is.

John Rogers: So I see him downtown all the time.

gevorg kulikyan: Hmm.

John Rogers: Okay.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, it's for a spring semester, though.

gevorg kulikyan: And it's only, like, 2 days a week.

John Rogers: When you did that interview, did they ask you some ethics questions?

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, and I think I answered it wrong.

John Rogers: You should have told me in advance that… I could have prepped you.

gevorg kulikyan: I didn't, I thought…

John Rogers: the client.

gevorg kulikyan: To be honest.

John Rogers: the client.

gevorg kulikyan: That's what my, answer was. I was looking out for my client.

gevorg kulikyan: So, the ethics question he gave was, like, the prosecutor…

gevorg kulikyan: So, in the midst of the judge sentencing.

gevorg kulikyan: You already had a plea deal with the prosecutor, but the prosecutor had to step out.

gevorg kulikyan: And a different prosecutor came in.

John Rogers: Okay?

gevorg kulikyan: You came to a deal with the prosecutor that your client will get 16 years, but the judge made a mistake and said 6 months.

gevorg kulikyan: So, what would you do in that situation? I said I would… I'm looking out for the best interest of my client.

gevorg kulikyan: And I wouldn't say anything.

gevorg kulikyan: And then… Yeah.

gevorg kulikyan: So, and then he's like, okay, but what if… so now, after that, you have…

gevorg kulikyan: You see that prosecutor again.

gevorg kulikyan: And that prosecutor says, hey, why didn't you speak up? Now I'm not going to give…

gevorg kulikyan: Now our relationship is strained, and now that strained relationship hurts your other clients that you have.

John Rogers: It wasn't my fault.

John Rogers: What was my fault?

John Rogers: What did I do wrong?

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: supposed to do your job, I have to represent a client. That's all on you.

gevorg kulikyan: So I didn't answer.

John Rogers: Why didn't you tell new counsel what was going on?

John Rogers: What am I supposed to do?

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: prosecutor?

gevorg kulikyan: And, the hypothetical, it said the other prosecutor was not paying attention.

John Rogers: Yeah, that's their problem.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: Your Honor, find my client not guilty, I wasn't paying attention. Like, you know…

John Rogers: But, in real practice, you'd let the court know, because…

John Rogers: That could be seen as,

John Rogers: misleading the court.

gevorg kulikyan: Hmm.

John Rogers: So, you're a little bit of a problem. So, in the real world, I would have to say, Your Honor, the offer's 16 years.

gevorg kulikyan: I would not like doing that, but…

John Rogers: There it is.

gevorg kulikyan: Hmm.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: I would not like doing that, but it could potentially be misleading the court if I didn't, because that's not what we agreed to.

Amir Akbari: And also, it hurts your credential, right?

Amir Akbari: Legion.

Amir Akbari: I mean, here's the thing, like, I'm gonna see this judge again, I'm gonna steal this prosecutor. Yeah, that's the problem.

John Rogers: That's like…

Amir Akbari: Maybe, like, every month.

John Rogers: As a prosecutor, I have to go ask them for settlement offers and try to get good offers from them, so it's like, if I screw them over one time, I'm gonna get the worst settlement offers from them.

John Rogers: So…

gevorg kulikyan: To be honest, I wasn't expecting any questions like that. I thought it was… they were gonna ask me questions about me as a.

John Rogers: Your first mistake was not talking to me first, okay?

gevorg kulikyan: I'm really quick.

John Rogers: Oh, this.

gevorg kulikyan: And it's how are you?

John Rogers: You got an interview very quick.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, it was… Less…

gevorg kulikyan: Last class, you said you should do the PD's office. The next day, I applied. Two days later, they gave me an interview.

John Rogers: No way! Wow.

John Rogers: In person?

gevorg kulikyan: No, it was on Zoom.

John Rogers: Okay.

Amir Akbari: Do they do the apartheid?

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, it's like, it's only 16 hours a week for.

Amir Akbari: Spring.

gevorg kulikyan: Summer is 40 hours.

Amir Akbari: Whoa.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Are you doing it as part of that program?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: With, bar.

John Rogers: Ahren, Arin, from my evidence class, is there 40 hours a week.

gevorg kulikyan: Hmm.

gevorg kulikyan: Honestly, I'm just doing it for experience. I didn't look into any programs or anything. I just want experience.

gevorg kulikyan: So I can stop asking, Professor Rogers every single criminal issue I have.

John Rogers: I used to teach criminal law.

gevorg kulikyan: Why'd you stop?

John Rogers: Because my colleague, who I taught property with as well, changed…

John Rogers: areas of law, and went to a new law firm, and he couldn't teach property anymore.

John Rogers: So then I got a call from Professor Zan that said, can you please teach property on… Tuesdays.

gevorg kulikyan: Hmm.

John Rogers: And I said, I can't do 3 classes, and he says, can you give up Kremlon? I said, fine.

gevorg kulikyan: Mmm.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I feel like crim law would be super interesting with you, you have so much…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: So much to talk about.

John Rogers: dude, but I wasn't easy with the class. The highest grade I ever gave in criminal law was a B.

John Rogers: I was tough on it.

John Rogers: That was very tough. I think I still am tough.

gevorg kulikyan: I would send me my essay if I ever got it back.

John Rogers: What?

gevorg kulikyan: I would send you my criminal law final essay if I was allowed to have it.

John Rogers: Then I have to read it, I don't… I don't want to do that.

gevorg kulikyan: Fair enough.

gevorg kulikyan: Well, thank you so much, Professor.

John Rogers: Yes, am I paroled? Am I paroled?

gevorg kulikyan: Thank you so much, have a good night.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I have one question for you at the end.

John Rogers: Yeah, what's up?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: As out of, like, you graded the adverse possession, like, what was… what was your… you said nobody really hit it on the marker. What was the reasoning? People just… analysis wasn't great?

John Rogers: Whoa.

John Rogers: Here's the thing.

John Rogers: How did you establish actual occupancy.

John Rogers: What facts were there to establish just actual occupancy?

John Rogers: How big was Whiteacre?

John Rogers: This is 10 acres.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Just.

John Rogers: Shed on 10 acres?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Hmm.

John Rogers: If you look at the Lutz case.

John Rogers: similar-type facts. They had random stuff in a woodshed.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I remember that, yeah.

John Rogers: And that court said it was insufficient to meet.

John Rogers: actual occupancy.

John Rogers: Because there's no evidence of really any improvement.

John Rogers: Part of the rationale in LUTS was there wasn't any sufficient enclosure, though.

John Rogers: So, in this fact pattern, there was a fence that was built, though.

John Rogers: Which shows enclosure. So it's distinguishable from that case.

John Rogers: But, okay, I have activity, and I only come here ever so often.

John Rogers: To use a storage shed?

John Rogers: On 10 acres.

John Rogers: So you gotta think about it. Is it being used as a reasonable owner, would you?

John Rogers: So there wasn't very much emphasis on that.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Got it, okay.

Amir Akbari: And I think that part is the most important part of the adverse position, other than the, like.

Amir Akbari: Color of title… Right? The actual is hard.

John Rogers: Color of title is not always an issue.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, it's not always…

John Rogers: Right, unless it's an issue, but I think it was an issue on that one, if I'm not mistaken. Can't remember.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, there was.

Amir Akbari: I didn't do that yet. I'm gonna do it.

Amir Akbari: I'm on the road.

John Rogers: You're on the road?

Amir Akbari: Yeah, no, on the role of the…

John Rogers: Oh.

Amir Akbari: Real property, yeah.

John Rogers: Yeah. So what do you think is worse, evidence or property? What do you think?

Amir Akbari: evidence for.

John Rogers: Isn't it?

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: Isn't that bad?

John Rogers: I thought property would be harder.

Amir Akbari: No, it's, like, a step-by-step, you can do that property, and it's logical.

John Rogers: Property is hard, or no, evidence is harder.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, for me, maybe my second language is just…

John Rogers: Yeah, I can see that.

Amir Akbari: Yes.

John Rogers: I could see that. I could see that.

John Rogers: I could see that for sure.

John Rogers: Anything else, guys, or am I… am I paroled?

Amir Akbari: Thank you so much. Have a good day.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Thank you, Professor. See you Saturday.

gevorg kulikyan: Thank you, Professor.
