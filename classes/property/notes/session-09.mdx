## I. Executory Interests Review

### A. Shifting vs. Springing Executory Interests

**Shifting Executory Interest**
- Takes property from a **grantee** (another transferee)
- Divests a prior owner who received from the grantor
- Example: O to A for life, but if B gets an A+ in property, then to B
  - A has: Life estate subject to executory limitation
  - B has: Shifting executory interest in life

**Springing Executory Interest**
- Takes property from the **grantor**
- Springs from the grantor to take possession
- Example: O to A if A gets an A+ in property
  - O has: Fee simple subject to executory limitation
  - A has: Springing executory interest in FSA

**Key Distinction**: Who is being divested?
- Grantee → Shifting
- Grantor → Springing

### B. Executory Interests vs. Remainders

**Critical Rule for Remainders**
- Must be capable of becoming possessory upon the **natural expiration** of the prior estate
- Example: O to A for life, then to B if B gets an A+ in property
  - B has: **Contingent remainder** (waits for A's natural death)

- Example: O to A for life, but if B gets an A+ in property, then to B
  - B has: **Shifting executory interest** (can take before A's death)

**Language Matters**
- "then to B if..." → Remainder (takes after natural expiration)
- "but if B..." → Executory interest (can divest early)

### C. Executory Interests in Life Estates

- Executory interests can apply to **life estates**, not just fee simple estates
- Example: O to A for life, but if C gets an A+ in property, then to B for life, then to C for life
  - A has: Life estate subject to executory limitation
  - B has: Vested remainder subject to complete divestment in life
  - C has: Shifting executory interest in life

## II. Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP)

### A. The Basic Rule

**Magic Words for Exams**
- "Is it **possible** within 21 years to **vest or fail to vest**?"
- Write these words on every RAP analysis

**Purpose**
- Prevents interests from "floating around forever"
- Voids remote vesting that could last in perpetuity

### B. Common Law RAP Applications

**1. Executory Interests Following Defeasible Fees**

Example: O to A and her heirs so long as Blackacre is used for residential purposes, otherwise to B and his heirs
- A has: Fee simple subject to executory limitation
- B has: Executory interest in FSA
- **RAP Application**: VOID every single time
- **Result**: Once B's interest is voided, A has fee simple determinable; O retains possibility of reverter

**Critical Distinction**:
- O to A so long as Blackacre used for residential purposes, otherwise to B
  - After RAP voids B's interest → A has FSD; O has possibility of reverter

- O to A, but if Blackacre not used for residential purposes, then to B
  - After RAP voids B's interest → Entire conveyance after comma is void
  - **Result**: A has FSA (condition and executory interest both gone)

**2. Valid Executory Interests - Life Measurement**

Example: O to A for life, but if Blackacre used for anything other than residential purposes, then to B for life
- A has: Fee simple subject to executory limitation (lasting only for duration of B's life)
- B has: Executory interest in life
- O has: Reversion (since interest ends at B's death)
- **RAP Application**: VALID
- **Reasoning**: Interest will vest or fail to vest within B's own life (not floating forever)

### C. RAP and Class Gifts

**The Age 22+ Rule** - **ALWAYS VOID**

**Critical Test Rule**: Any condition requiring individuals to reach age **22 or more** → VOID under RAP

Example: O to A for life, then to B's children who reach the age of 22
- Current facts: B has two children (C=17, D=21)
- **RAP Analysis**: VOID
- **Reasoning**:
  - Measured at time of creation, not actual facts
  - Possible scenario: B could have another child; then everyone dies on plane crash
  - New child would take more than 21 years to reach age 22
  - Therefore, void for remote vesting

**Result**: If class gift is void, conveyance reads: O to A for life (period)

**The Age 21 Rule** - VALID
- If condition requires age 21 or less → VALID under RAP
- Can vest within 21 years of measuring life

**Special Rules**

*Rule of Convenience*
- If one member of class reaches required age before life tenant dies, may save entire class
- Minority view; jurisdiction-dependent

*All or Nothing Rule*
- Every single member must satisfy condition or entire class fails
- Common law/majority view

**Exam Tip**: When you see age 22+, immediately know it's void. Tattoo this to your brain.

### D. Modern RAP Approaches

**Common Law Approach**
- Apply traditional RAP analysis
- Measure at time of creation
- Lives in being plus 21 years

**Uniform Statutory RAP (U.S. RAP) - Modern/iPhone Law**

Three-step analysis:
1. **First**: Apply common law rule
   - If valid under common law → Done!
2. **Second**: If fails common law, apply "wait and see" approach
   - Wait 21 years and see if interest vests
3. **Third**: Wait 90 years
   - See if interest vests within 90 years

**Note**: Different jurisdictions have different wait-and-see periods, but 90 years is the uniform rule

### E. RAP Exceptions

**Charity to Charity Exception**
- RAP does **not apply** to conveyances from charity to charity
- Example: Red Cross to Salvation Army → Valid, no RAP analysis
- **DOES NOT apply** to private person to charity
- Must be charity → charity

## III. Interaction with Future Interests Doctrines

### A. Rule in Shelley's Case

**The Rule**: When one instrument creates:
1. Life estate in A, AND
2. Remainder in A's heirs (or heirs of A's body)
3. Both legal or both equitable

**Result**: The two estates merge → A gets FSA

Example: O to A so long as Blackacre used for residential purposes, otherwise to B for life, then to B's heirs
- Initially: A has FSSEL; B has executory interest in life; B's heirs have contingent remainder in FSA
- **Apply Shelley's Case**: B's life estate + B's heirs' remainder merge → B has executory interest in FSA
- **Apply RAP**: B's executory interest in FSA is VOID
- **Final Result**: A has fee simple determinable; O has possibility of reverter

**Modern Status**
- Abolished in overwhelming majority of states
- Still valid in very small minority
- **Exam Approach**: Even if iPhone law/modern fact pattern, still discuss if it appears

### B. Doctrine of Worthier Title

**The Rule**: When instrument conveys:
- Life estate to grantee, AND
- Remainder to grantor's heirs

**Result**: Language creating remainder in grantor's heirs is void
- Reads as: O to A for life (period)
- O automatically has reversion

**Modern Status**
- Abolished in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Texas, and others
- **Exam Approach**: Still discuss if it appears, even in modern jurisdictions

### C. Destructibility of Contingent Remainders

**Common Law Rule**
- If contingent remainder does not vest by the time the prior estate ends → It destructs (destroyed)
- Example: O to A for life, then to B if B gets an A+ in property
  - If A dies before B gets A+, at common law B's interest is destroyed
  - Goes back to O (reversion)
  - B's interest typically converts to springing executory interest

**Modern/iPhone Law**
- Contingent remainders are generally **not destructible**
- Check jurisdiction

## IV. Co-Tenancies (Introduction)

### A. When Co-Tenancy Issues Arise

**Trigger Language**: "O conveys Blackacre to A and B"
- Two or more people have simultaneous interests in property
- Need to determine what type of co-tenancy

### B. Three Types of Co-Tenancies

1. **Tenancy in Common** (most common, default)
2. **Joint Tenancy** (tested heavily)
3. **Tenancy by the Entirety** (less common, but fair game)

### C. Joint Tenancy - Basic Principles

**Right of Survivorship**
- Last remaining survivor gets 100% fee simple absolute
- While alive: Each has separate but undivided interest
- Example: Three siblings own property 1/3 each
  - One dies → Two survivors now own 50% each
  - Second dies → Last survivor owns 100%

**Undivided Interest**
- Cannot divide property physically ("you get that third of the toilet")
- Each has equal right to possess and enjoy entire property
- If property sold, proceeds divided proportionally

**Critical Rule: Wills Are Meaningless**
- Joint tenant cannot devise their interest by will
- If you don't survive longest, you have **no interest** to convey at death
- Will language leaving joint tenancy interest = "squiggly lines on paper"
- Interest automatically passes to surviving joint tenants

**Litigation Example**
- Two brothers held land in joint tenancy
- Both killed by train simultaneously
- Issue: Who was last survivor?
- Evidence: One had blood squirting from neck (heart still beating)
- Held: Person with beating heart survived longer → their heirs take 100%

### D. Creating Joint Tenancy - Common Law

**Four Unities Required** (Time, Title, Interest, Possession)

1. **Time**: Interests must vest at same time
2. **Title**: Must take through same instrument (same deed/will)
3. **Interest**: Must have same type of estate (both FSA, or both life estates, etc.)
4. **Possession**: Equal right of possession and enjoyment

**If any unity missing → No joint tenancy created**

**Straw Person Requirement**
- Common law: If you already own property, cannot simply add another person as joint tenant
- Reason: Violates time and title unities
- **Procedure**:
  1. Convey property to straw person (often attorney) in FSA
  2. Straw person re-conveys to you and new person as joint tenants
  3. Now all four unities satisfied

### E. Creating Joint Tenancy - Modern Law

**Modern Approach**
- No longer requires four unities or straw person
- Only requires **specific language** showing intent to create joint tenancy
- Magic words: "Joint tenants with right of survivorship"
- Must demonstrate grantor's clear intent

**Analysis Approach**
- Common law fact pattern → Discuss all four unities separately
- Modern fact pattern → Focus on grantor's intent and specific language

## V. Key Exam Tips

### RAP Analysis Framework
1. Identify future interests subject to RAP (executory interests, contingent remainders, vested remainders subject to open)
2. Ask: Is it **possible** this could vest more than 21 years after relevant lives in being?
3. Use magic words: "possible," "21 years," "vest or fail to vest"
4. Special rules:
   - Age 22+ = VOID (always)
   - Age 21 or less = VALID
   - Life measurement = Usually VALID
   - Executory interest following defeasible fee = VOID (usually)

### Future Interests Checklist
1. Classify all interests first
2. Check for Shelley's Case (life estate + remainder in A's heirs)
3. Check for Worthier Title (life estate + remainder in O's heirs)
4. Apply RAP to appropriate interests
5. Determine what happens after RAP voids interests
6. State final classification of all interests

### Co-Tenancy Analysis
1. Identify trigger (multiple grantees)
2. Determine type of co-tenancy
3. Common law vs. modern jurisdiction?
4. If joint tenancy, check four unities (common law) or intent (modern)
5. Consider severance, adverse possession, contribution issues (to be covered)
