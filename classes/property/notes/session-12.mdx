## I. Types of Leases

### A. Term of Years Lease
- **Definition**: A lease with a **fixed end date**
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Can be calculated from the lease terms (e.g., "one year from January 1, 2026")
  - Duration can be any length (45 days, 100 years, etc.)
  - **No notice required** to terminate - predetermined by the parties at lease inception
- **Statute of Frauds**: If lease **exceeds one year** (one year + one day or more), it **must be in writing** to be enforceable
  - "In writing" can be informal (cocktail napkin, lipstick on toilet paper, etched in toilet seat)
  - If not in writing, defaults to periodic tenancy (month-to-month)

### B. Periodic Tenancy
- **Definition**: Lease with **successive periods** (month-to-month, week-to-week)
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Continues from period to period until terminated
  - **Notice required** to terminate
  - Generally **30 days advance notice** for month-to-month
  - One full-term advance notice for other periods (e.g., one week for week-to-week)
  - If tenant fails to give sufficient notice, bound to another term

### C. Tenancy at Will
- **Definition**: Lease that continues **as long as both parties want**
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - No fixed end date
  - No successive periods
  - Can be terminated **at any time**
  - Automatically terminates upon:
    - Death of either party
    - Sale of the property
    - Assignment to another tenant
    - Waste committed by tenant
- **WARNING**: If termination power is **solely in tenant's hands** (e.g., "stay as long as you want"), this may create a **life estate** instead
  - Must be careful when inviting friends to stay
  - Should specify: "You can stay as long as you want, but I can terminate at any time"

### D. Tenancy at Sufferance (Holdover Tenant)
- **Definition**: Tenant remains in possession **after lease terminates**
- **Landlord's Remedies**:
  - Sue for damages
  - Eviction through court process
  - Hold tenant to new **periodic tenancy** (defaults to month-to-month)

## II. Delivery of Possession

### A. English Rule (Majority View)
- Landlord must provide **both**:
  - **Legal possession** (tenant has legal right to be there)
  - **Actual possession** (tenant can physically occupy)
- If prior tenant still occupying, **landlord's duty** to remove them

### B. American Rule (Minority View)
- Landlord only required to provide **legal possession**
- No requirement to provide actual possession
- If prior tenant still there, **new tenant's duty** to evict them

### C. Best Practice on Exam
- Discuss both rules
- Conclude with **English rule** as majority view
- Rationale: Prevents confrontation and violence between tenants

## III. Assignments vs. Subleases

### A. General Distinction
- **Assignment** = Transfer of **EVERYTHING**
- **Sublease** = Transfer of **LESS THAN EVERYTHING**

### B. Determining Factors
**Most controlling factor**: **Duration of the lease**
- Transfer of all remaining time = likely assignment
- Transfer of less than all time (even one day less) = sublease
- Reserving any portion of premises (e.g., closet) = sublease

**Intent and surrounding circumstances** (majority view)
- Majority view: Look at intent and circumstances, not just what parties call it
- Minority view: What parties call it controls
- **Red flag**: If in "quotations," someone is saying it (not foundational fact)

### C. Assignment - Legal Consequences
**Privity relationships**:
- **Assignee** is in privity with landlord
- **Original tenant** remains in privity of contract with landlord
- Everyone can sue each other (landlord, original tenant, assignee)

**Payment obligations**:
- Assignee pays landlord directly
- Assignee can sue landlord and vice versa
- Original tenant still liable if assignee doesn't pay

**Multiple assignments** (L → T → A1 → A2 → A3):
- Only **landlord, original tenant, and last assignee (A3)** can be sued
- A1 and A2 cannot be sued (no privity) UNLESS they **assumed the lease obligations**
- **"Assumed"** or **"personal liability"** = puts assignee on the hook

### D. Sublease - Legal Consequences
**Privity relationships**:
- **No privity** between sublessee and landlord
- Sublessee cannot sue landlord
- Landlord cannot sue sublessee
- Original tenant (sublessor) acts as sublessee's landlord

**Payment obligations**:
- Sublessee pays original tenant
- Original tenant still pays landlord
- Landlord must go through original tenant for remedies

### E. Transfer Restrictions (Restraint Clauses)
- **Strictly construed in favor of tenant**
- "Tenant cannot sublease" → tenant can still assign
- "Tenant cannot assign" → tenant can still sublease
- Must say both to prohibit all transfers

**Rule in Dumpor's Case**:
- If landlord permits one transfer despite no-transfer clause
- Landlord **waives** ability to object to future transfers
- **UNLESS** landlord expressly reserves right to object to future assignments

### F. Exam Hint
- If secondary tenant's name begins with **S** (Shelly, Sam, Sarah) = sublessee
- If short name (Al, Alex, Ashley) = assignment

## IV. Landlord's Remedies

### A. Self-Help - PROHIBITED
- Landlord **cannot** physically oust tenant
- Must **always use judicial process**
- Rationale: Prevents confrontation and violence
- Exception: None (always use courts)

### B. Surrender
- **Offer by tenant** to terminate lease
- Landlord **must accept** for termination to be effective
- If accepted: **extinguishes all future obligations**
- Landlord can still collect **accrued (back) rent**
- Look for: tenant tendering keys and last month's rent in fact pattern
- May need to be in writing if terminating lease over one year remaining

### C. Abandonment
- Tenant leaves **without justification**
- **Not** a way to terminate lease
- Tenant may be **justified** in leaving if:
  - No hot water, electricity, gas
  - Habitability issues
  - Landlord's failure to correct problems

### D. Duty to Mitigate
**Minority view**:
- Landlord has **no duty** to mitigate
- Can sit back and do nothing, then sue for all unpaid rent

**Majority view** (CRITICAL - tested almost every year):
- Landlord **must use reasonable efforts** to find replacement tenant
- If landlord mitigates: Can collect for months until re-letting
- If landlord doesn't mitigate: **Cannot collect anything**
- Contracts principle: non-breaching party must mitigate losses

**Exam application**:
- Discuss both views (one sentence for minority sufficient)
- Conclude with majority view
- Analyze whether landlord made reasonable efforts
- Calculate damages based on mitigation efforts

## V. Quiet Enjoyment & Eviction

### A. Types of Eviction

**1. Actual Eviction**
- Physical ouster from premises
- No obligation to pay further rent

**2. Partial Eviction**
- Partially ousted (can live there but can't use kitchen/toilets)
- Not heavily tested

**3. Constructive Eviction** (GUARANTEED ON FINAL)
- **Based on landlord's omission** to remedy problems
- Tenant forced to leave even though not physically ousted

### B. Constructive Eviction - Elements

**Element 1: Substantial Interference**
- Must be **objectively offensive** (not just subjective)
- Reasonable person standard
- **50% of points** on this discussion alone

**Common examples**:
- No hot water
- Toxic mold
- Black mold
- Loud noises from neighbors (if landlord has control)
- Rodents
- Leaks
- Smells (if caused by landlord and correctable)

**NOT substantial interference**:
- Daddy long-leg spider in corner
- Subjective hypersensitivity
- Things landlord cannot control (smell from across street)
- Registered sex offender neighbor (generally not landlord's control)

**Element 2: Landlord Can Remedy**
- Must be something within landlord's control
- Landlord can reasonably correct the issue

**Element 3: Tenant Must Actually Leave**
- (Additional elements covered in future sessions)

**Waiver**:
- If tenant **knew of interference** when signing lease, may have **waived** the claim

## VI. Important Exam Tips

### Types of Leases
1. **First step**: Identify what type of lease exists
2. Look for fixed end date, successive periods, or indefinite duration
3. Remember Statute of Frauds for leases exceeding one year

### Assignments/Subleases
1. **Duration is most controlling factor**
2. Analyze intent and surrounding circumstances
3. Draw out privity relationships
4. Identify who can sue whom
5. Watch for "assumed obligations" language
6. Check for restraint clauses

### Landlord's Remedies
1. **Always** discuss duty to mitigate when landlord seeks rent
2. Surrender requires landlord's acceptance
3. Distinguish justified vs. unjustified abandonment
4. Never allow self-help remedies

### Quiet Enjoyment
1. **Constructive eviction guaranteed on final**
2. Focus on "substantial interference" analysis
3. Must be objectively offensive, not subjective
4. Must be within landlord's control
5. Use 50% of discussion on substantial interference element

## VII. Minority vs. Majority Rules - When to Discuss Both

**Full discussion of both required**:
- English Rule vs. American Rule (delivery of possession)
- Lien theory vs. title theory (future topic)

**One sentence for minority sufficient**:
- All other minority/majority distinctions
- Duty to mitigate
- Assignment/sublease determination
