## II. Introduction to Contracts Law

### A. What Law Governs Contracts?

#### 1. **Common Law**
- Governs ALL contracts EXCEPT sale of goods
- Based on case law/judicial precedent

#### 2. **Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)**
- Governs SALE OF GOODS only
- Model set of laws first adopted in 1950s
- Now adopted by all 50 states (including California)
- Only Article 2 tested on bar exam
- Key provision: UCC 2-207 ("Battle of the Forms")

### B. Key Definitions

#### 1. **Agreement** (Restatement Second § 3)
- **Definition**: A manifestation of mutual assent sufficiently definite to conclude a bargain
- **"Manifestation"**: Expression (express or implied) of intent; outward communication
- **"Mutual Assent"**: Both parties agree
- **"Sufficiently Definite"**: Not 100% definite; major and essential terms agreed upon
- **Important**: Agreement ≠ Contract (not all agreements are enforceable)

#### 2. **Contract**
- **Primary Definition**: A promise or set of promises for the breach of which the law gives a remedy, OR the performance of which the law in some way recognizes as a duty
- **Restatement Second § 1**: A set of promises that the law will enforce
- **Alternative Definition**: Offer + Acceptance + Consideration
- **Key Concept**: An agreement between parties that the law will recognize and enforce

### C. Objective Theory of Contracts

#### 1. **Core Principle** (Lucy v. Zehmer case)
- Contract formation based on OBJECTIVE manifestations, not subjective intent
- What matters: What you actually said and did (outward manifestation)
- What doesn't matter: What you thought in your head; being drunk/joking

#### 2. **Application**
- Court examines: Words, conduct, actions that would lead reasonable person to conclude agreement exists
- Cannot later claim "I was joking," "I was drunk," "I didn't mean it"
- Intent judged by objective standards

### D. Mutual Assent Requirements
- Parties need NOT agree on everything
- Must agree on MAJOR and ESSENTIAL terms only
- Court may supplement or substitute minor missing terms (especially under UCC)
- **Central Focus**: Intent to be bound by contract terms
  - Intent is in the head but proven by outward manifestations
  - Intent is everything (similar to criminal law)

## III. Sale of Goods vs. Other Contracts

### A. What Are "Goods"? (UCC § 2-105)

#### 1. **Definition**
- All things that are MOVABLE and TANGIBLE at the time identified to be sold under contract
- Must be able to touch/feel the item
- Intangible items are NOT goods

#### 2. **Special Cases: Real Estate-Related Items**
- May fall under Article 2 (UCC) if:
  - Seller will sever from land, OR
  - Buyer will sever from land
- Examples: minerals, growing crops, uncut timber, fixtures removed from land

#### 3. **What Are NOT Goods**
- Real estate/buildings (not movable)
- Services (intangible)
- People (not "things")
- Employment contracts
- Car leases (no sale/transfer of title)

### B. What Is "Sale"?
- **Definition**: Change of ownership; title passes from seller to buyer
- **Lease/Rental**: NOT a sale (no title transfer; only possession and use for time period)
- **Must have BOTH**: Sale AND Goods for UCC to apply

## IV. Mixed/Hybrid Contracts

### A. Definition
- Contracts involving BOTH common law elements AND UCC (goods) elements
- Example: Pizza delivery (goods = pizza; service = delivery)

### B. Severability Test

#### 1. **When Promises Are Severable**
- **Definition**: Contracts are severable when promises are INDEPENDENT and APPORTIONABLE

#### 2. **Independent Promises**
- **Test**: Parties' intent evidences they would have contracted for promises separately
- Example: Car purchase + separate detail service contract with separate pricing

#### 3. **Apportionable Promises**
- **Test**: Promises can be allocated promise-to-promise
- Example: Gardening contract at $50/month for 12 months = 12 separate promises in one contract

#### 4. **When Severable**
- Apply appropriate law to each separate part
- Common law to service portions
- UCC to goods portions

### C. Predominant Purpose Rule (When NOT Severable)

#### 1. **Application**
- When elements cannot be severed, apply law based on predominant purpose
- Only ONE body of law applies (either common law OR UCC)

#### 2. **Determining Predominant Purpose**
- Look to the **INTENT of the parties** (especially the buyer)
- What did the buyer primarily want?
- Court examines: conduct, custom, circumstances, pricing allocation

#### 3. **Examples**
- **Portrait painting**: Service vs. end result? (Likely end result = goods)
- **Photography**: Photographer's skill vs. photos? (Could be either)
- **Apple Computer + AppleCare**: Severable (separate pricing on receipt)
  - Computer = UCC (goods)
  - AppleCare = Common Law (service)

## V. Offer (Introduction)

### A. Definition of an Offer
**An offer is an INTENT to be bound by certain DEFINITE TERMS which are communicated to the OFFEREE**

#### 1. **Intent to Be Bound**
- Judged by objective theory of contracts
- Not subjective thoughts; outward manifestations matter

#### 2. **Certain Definite Terms** = Material Terms

##### a. **Under Common Law**
- Material terms = those necessary for court to:
  1. Determine if there was a breach, AND
  2. Create a remedy if breach occurred
- Examples: subject matter identification, parties' identities, purchase price, etc.

##### b. **Under UCC**
- **ONLY requirement: QUANTITY** (and intent)
- Everything else filled in by "Gap Fillers"
  - Price
  - Time of delivery
  - Location of delivery
  - Time of payment
- Quantity cannot be gap-filled (court cannot determine remedy without knowing quantity)

#### 3. **Communicated to the Offeree**
- Must actually communicate offer to the intended recipient
- Cannot form contract based on uncommunicated intent

### B. Terminology
- **Offeror**: Person/entity who MAKES the offer (master of the offer)
- **Offeree**: Person/entity who RECEIVES the offer (NOT "accepts" - that comes later)
- Offeree must be designated person/entity with power to accept

## VI. Course Structure & Big Picture

### A. First Semester Topics (Formation)
1. What is a contract vs. what is not
2. What is enforceable vs. what is not
3. **Offer**:
   - What is/is not an offer
   - Is offer still valid at time of purported acceptance?
   - Can offer die, be revoked, lapse?
4. **Acceptance**:
   - Who can accept?
   - How can you accept?
   - What types of acceptance exist?
5. **Consideration**: The "glue" binding offer to acceptance
   - Exchange ("this for that")
   - Can be mutual promises
6. **Consideration Substitutes**
7. **Formation Defenses**:
   - Capacity (e.g., minors - 12-year-old's contract)
   - When contracts may/may not be enforceable

### B. Second Semester Topics (Performance & Breach)
1. Statute of Frauds (finally correctly placed first in 8th edition)
2. Can contract be enforced?
3. Breach analysis
4. Remedies
5. Conditions (challenging topic)
6. Performance defenses

### C. Key Concepts Introduced
- **Promissory Estoppel**: Can enforce promises even without formal contract
- Course uses case method to teach lawyering skills, not just black letter law
- Professor provides "spoon feeding" of black letter law to supplement casebook

## VII. Professional Practice Insights

### A. Importance of Discipline
- Punctuality critical in court (especially civil court - 3 minutes late can result in case dismissal/sanctions)
- Being prepared = professional requirement
- Parallels between classroom expectations and courtroom requirements

### B. Value of Legal Education
- Law degree = second most valuable license (after medical license)
- Opens doors beyond practicing law: law enforcement, corporate positions, etc.
- Changes how you think and read forever
- Best investment of time for earning capacity enhancement

### C. Teaching Philosophy
- Uses real-world examples from 27 years of practice
- Shares mistakes to help students avoid them
- "Spoon feeds" black letter law while casebook teaches lawyering
- Judges teaching at school = invaluable practical perspective
- Slow pace in beginning intentional (legal language is new; will accelerate later)

## VIII. Study Tips & Approach

### A. Reading Law
- Every word in legal definition matters
- Law school changes how you read forever
- Must read critically and precisely

### B. Case Briefing
- Brief all cases in assigned reading
- Cases in casebook already "briefed" from original (which can be 20+ pages)
- No canned briefs allowed
- May be required to email briefs if unprepared

### C. Big Picture Thinking
- Get "sky view" of each course
- Understand where each topic fits in overall structure
- Helps with planning and retention

### D. Questions Welcome
- Stop professor if definition unclear
- Ask for repetition - professor welcomes it
- Focus on your learning, not others' opinions

## Key Takeaways for Studying:

1. **Contract Formation** = Offer + Acceptance + Consideration
2. **Governing Law**: Common Law (default) vs. UCC (sale of goods ONLY)
3. **Objective Theory**: Outward manifestations control, not subjective intent
4. **Mixed Contracts**: Sever if possible; if not, use predominant purpose test (intent-based)
5. **Material Terms**: Common law = many; UCC = quantity only
6. **Intent is central** to all contract analysis

*This outline covers the foundational concepts introduced in Session 01. The professor emphasized that the beginning pace is intentionally slow to build proper understanding of legal language and concepts. Students should focus on mastering these fundamental definitions and principles, as they form the basis for all subsequent contract law analysis.*
