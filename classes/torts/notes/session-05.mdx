# Trespass to Land & Chattels

### 1. Trespass to Land (Scope of License)
* [cite_start]**Black Letter Law:** A trespass action will lie if a defendant enters land with permission (a license) but overstays the duration of the permission or fails to remove an object from the land after the license has expired[cite: 156].
    * [cite_start]**License Definition:** Permission/authority to enter upon the land of another[cite: 144].
* **Key Case:** *Rogers*
    * **Facts:** Defendant had a license to place a snow fence on the decedent's land during winter but failed to remove the post after the season/license expired. [cite_start]The husband died when his mower struck the post[cite: 113, 128, 129].
    * [cite_start]**Holding:** The failure to remove the object after the license expired reverted the defendant to the status of a trespasser[cite: 133, 155].

### 2. Trespass to Chattel vs. Conversion
* **Black Letter Law:**
    * [cite_start]**Trespass to Chattel:** Requires either (1) some harm/damage to the chattel OR (2) dispossession of the chattel for a long enough period that the dispossession itself constitutes damage[cite: 207, 208, 209].
    * **Distinction from Conversion:** The difference is the **degree of interference**.
        * [cite_start]**Trespass to Chattel:** Shorter duration or less interference (e.g., taking a bike for an hour)[cite: 225, 230].
        * [cite_start]**Conversion:** substantial interference or total destruction (e.g., taking a bike for a month)[cite: 227].
* **Key Cases:**
    * *Liden* (1949): Statutory strict liability for dog bites existed unless the plaintiff was trespassing. [cite_start]The court found a child playing with a dog did not commit trespass to chattel because there was no harm to the dog and no dispossession[cite: 161, 203, 206].
    * [cite_start]*CompuServe v. Cyber Promotions* (1997): Defendant sent unsolicited spam email using CompuServe’s routers[cite: 264, 271]. [cite_start]The court held that electronic signals are sufficiently physically tangible to support a trespass cause of action, and damages were satisfied by "intermeddling" that interfered with the possessor's interest[cite: 335, 336].
    * [cite_start]*Pearson v. Dodd:* Former employees removed files, copied them, and returned the originals[cite: 343]. [cite_start]Court held this was **not conversion** because the documents were returned before the owner could use them, and the information was not proprietary property[cite: 352, 353].

# Affirmative Defenses to Intentional Torts

**General Procedural Rule:**
* Plaintiff must prove the prima facie elements of the tort (Case in Chief). [cite_start]Attacking the sufficiency of the plaintiff's case is *not* an affirmative defense[cite: 431, 433].
* [cite_start]If the plaintiff meets their burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to raise affirmative defenses[cite: 437, 439].
* [cite_start]**Legal Effect:** A valid affirmative defense is a **complete bar to recovery**[cite: 442, 444, 618].

### 1. Shopkeeper's Privilege
* **Black Letter Law:** A shopkeeper is privileged to detain a person if three elements are met:
    1.  [cite_start]**Reasonable Belief:** There must be a reasonable belief as to the theft[cite: 529, 530].
    2.  [cite_start]**Reasonable Manner:** The detention must be conducted in a reasonable manner, and **no deadly force** can be used[cite: 531, 532].
    3.  [cite_start]**Reasonable Time:** The detention must be only for a reasonable period of time to complete the investigation[cite: 534, 535].

### 2. Consent
* **Black Letter Law:** Consent is a defense to intentional torts (e.g., Battery).
    * [cite_start]**Express Consent:** Exists where plaintiff has expressly submitted (written or oral) to defendant's conduct[cite: 666, 705, 706].
        * [cite_start]*Vitiation:* **Fraud** and **Duress** vitiate (nullify) consent[cite: 708, 726, 736].
    * **Implied Consent:**
        * [cite_start]**Apparent Consent:** Exists when a reasonable person would infer consent from the plaintiff's conduct[cite: 751, 753].
        * [cite_start]**Consent Implied by Law:** Exists where action is necessary to save a person's life or an important interest in property (e.g., emergency surgery on an unconscious patient)[cite: 764, 766].
* **Key Cases:**
    * [cite_start]*Hackbart (Cincinnati Bengals):* Players imply consent to conduct within the rules of the game (Apparent Consent) but do not consent to intentional blows/conduct outside the rules[cite: 1195, 1200].
    * *O'Brien (1891):* Plaintiff stood in line and held out her arm for a vaccination. [cite_start]Court held this was **apparent consent** manifested by her conduct[cite: 1254, 1268].
    * *De May v. Roberts (1881):* A man falsely claiming to be a doctor's assistant held a woman's hand during childbirth. [cite_start]Any implied consent was invalid because it was obtained through **fraud** regarding his identity/qualifications[cite: 1214, 1226].

### 3. Self-Defense & Defense of Others
* [cite_start]**Self-Defense Rule:** When a person has a reasonable belief that they are about to be attacked, they may use **reasonable force** for protection[cite: 790, 792].
    * *Proportionality:* Force must be reasonable. [cite_start]Deadly force can only be used to counter deadly force[cite: 800].
* [cite_start]**Defense of Others Rule:** One may use force to defend another person **only when the other person could have used force**[cite: 872, 874].
    * [cite_start]*Standard:* The defender steps into the shoes of the victim[cite: 885].

### 4. Defense of Property
* [cite_start]**Black Letter Law:** One may use reasonable force to prevent the **commission** of a tort against their property[cite: 898, 899].
* **Limitations:**
    * Force can only be used while the tort is in progress (hot pursuit). [cite_start]Once the tort is completed (e.g., thief has escaped), force is no longer privileged[cite: 904, 910].
    * [cite_start]**Deadly force** can **never** be used solely to defend property[cite: 915].

### 5. Public Necessity
* [cite_start]**Black Letter Law:** Where the act is for the public good, the defense is absolute[cite: 1011].
* [cite_start]**Damages:** Those whose property is destroyed by an act of public necessity will **not** have the right to recover[cite: 1020].
* [cite_start]**Examples:** Fire department smashing a car window to access a hydrant during a fire[cite: 1025]. [cite_start]Blowing up a house to create a firebreak during a city-wide conflagration[cite: 1018, 1374].

### 6. Private Necessity
* [cite_start]**Black Letter Law:** A defendant acting out of private necessity is relieved of the technical tort of trespass but **must compensate** the plaintiff for any actual damage done[cite: 1038, 1039].
* **Hypothetical:** A person seeks shelter under a stranger's porch during a severe lightning storm.
    * [cite_start]*Trespass:* The landowner cannot eject the person while the danger (storm) persists[cite: 1344].
    * [cite_start]*Damages:* If the person breaks a vase or damages the floor while sheltering, they are liable for those damages[cite: 1061, 1062].

### 7. Justification
* [cite_start]**Black Letter Law:** A "catch-all" defense used when other defenses do not fit, but it would be unjust to hold the defendant liable[cite: 1082, 1083].
* [cite_start]**Elements:** Actions taken were reasonable and done to protect others from injury or to protect property[cite: 1092].

### 8. Statute of Limitations
* [cite_start]**Definition:** A specific time period within which a legal action must be filed[cite: 1106].
* **Nature:** It is an affirmative defense. [cite_start]A plaintiff can file a lawsuit after the period expires; the defendant must actively **raise** the statute of limitations defense[cite: 1112, 1115].
* [cite_start]**Legal Effect:** If valid, it is a complete bar to recovery[cite: 1142].

# Exam Writing Technique
* **Structure:**
    1.  Identify Parties.
    2.  Identify Cause of Action (e.g., Battery).
    3.  State Rule.
    4.  Analysis (Apply facts to Prima Facie elements).
    5.  Conclusion.
    6.  **Affirmative Defenses:** Always address this section. [cite_start]If no defenses apply, explicitly state: "The facts do not give rise to any affirmative defenses"[cite: 480, 482].
