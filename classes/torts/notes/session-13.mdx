# Negligence: Duty of Care

## 1. Establishing a Duty

### Black Letter Law / Rule

[cite_start]To establish a Prima Facie case for Negligence, the plaintiff must prove four elements: Duty, Breach, Causation, and Damages[cite: 214, 229]. For the first element, **Duty**, there are three specific pathways to prove its existence:

1. [cite_start]**Affirmative Act creating Risk:** When a defendant engages in an activity that increases the risk of physical harm towards **foreseeable plaintiffs**, the defendant owes a duty to act as a reasonable, prudent person under the circumstances[cite: 148, 150].
   - [cite_start]**Foreseeable Plaintiff:** Someone located within the "Zone of Danger"[cite: 158].
   - [cite_start]**Zone of Danger:** Defined as the area of increased risk of physical harm[cite: 159, 208].
2. [cite_start]**Negligence Per Se:** Violation of an applicable statute (usually criminal) establishes a presumption of the existence of a duty and breach thereof[cite: 115, 136, 497].
3. [cite_start]**Privity of Contract:** A duty is established via a contractual relationship between the parties[cite: 144, 287].

### Nuance & Policy

- **Litigation Strategy:** Never rely solely on "No Duty" as a defense. [cite_start]A competent attorney argues all elements (Duty, Breach, Causation, Damages) because if the court finds a duty exists, relying only on that single defense will result in a loss[cite: 222, 237].
- [cite_start]**Duty as a Limiting Tool:** Duty functions as a liability-limiting tool for courts[cite: 204].

# Privity and Product Liability

### Black Letter Law / Rule

Historically, duty was limited to those in **Privity of Contract** (e.g., _Winterbottom_). [cite_start]However, modern law has eliminated both **vertical** and **horizontal** privity as requirements for finding a duty of care in negligence regarding defective products[cite: 391, 401].

- [cite_start]**Vertical Privity:** The chain of distribution (Manufacturer -\> Wholesaler -\> Retailer -\> Consumer)[cite: 393].
- [cite_start]**Horizontal Privity:** The relationship between the buyer and others who might use the product (e.g., a guest, a passenger)[cite: 402, 412].

### Key Cases

- **MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co.**
  - **Facts:** Buick manufactured a car with a defective wooden wheel. [cite_start]The wheel collapsed, injuring the plaintiff (who bought the car from a dealer, not Buick directly)[cite: 309, 310].
  - **Holding:** A manufacturer owes a duty of care to foreseeable users (consumers) even without privity of contract. [cite_start]By engaging in the activity of manufacturing and putting a defective product into the stream of commerce that increases the risk of physical harm, a duty is created[cite: 388, 414].
- **Winterbottom (Common Law Context)**
  - [cite_start]**Facts:** A mail carrier was injured by a defective carriage but was not the one who contracted for its repair[cite: 290].
  - [cite_start]**Holding:** Under old common law, no duty was owed because there was no privity of contract between the repair shop and the mail carrier[cite: 293].

# Feasance: Classifications of Conduct

### Black Letter Law / Rule

Attorneys must distinguish between three types of conduct regarding duty:

1. [cite_start]**Malfeasance:** Performing an act that is illegal or wrongful (e.g., setting a fire)[cite: 546, 584].
2. [cite_start]**Misfeasance:** Performing a legal act improperly or inadequately, which causes harm (e.g., medical malpractice, fixing brakes incorrectly)[cite: 557, 564].
3. [cite_start]**Nonfeasance:** Failure to act when there was a duty to act[cite: 549].

### Key Cases

- **H.R. Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Water Co.**
  - **Facts:** A water company contracted with the city to provide water. A fire occurred at plaintiff's warehouse, and there was insufficient water pressure to stop it. [cite_start]Plaintiff sued the water company[cite: 503, 507].
  - **Holding:** The water company was not liable. This was **nonfeasance** (failure to confer a benefit). [cite_start]The contract was with the city, not the resident; failure to provide sufficient pressure is a denial of a benefit, not the commission of a wrong[cite: 581, 592].

# Foreseeability and Duty (Firearms)

### Black Letter Law / Rule

[cite_start]Mere ownership of a firearm does not automatically create a duty of care to third parties to prevent others from using it[cite: 721]. [cite_start]Foreseeability is the test for duty, but it requires recognizing an **undue risk**, not just that a specific mechanism of harm is _possible_[cite: 739].

### Key Cases

- **Brown v. Kerr**
  - **Facts:** Defendants' son stole a gun from their locked cabinet and shot his friend. [cite_start]Parents knew the son had previous behavioral issues (stealing meds) but didn't think he had a drug problem[cite: 643, 650].
  - **Holding:** The parents owed no duty. It was not foreseeable that the son would take the gun and shoot someone merely because they owned a gun. [cite_start]Guns are not inherently dangerous instruments when sitting stored[cite: 723, 738].

### Hypotheticals & Examples

- **The High & Angry Son:** If the parents saw their son was high and angry at his friend, and _then_ left a loaded gun on the kitchen counter, the court would likely find a duty. [cite_start]The specific facts make the harm foreseeable[cite: 741, 934].

# Social Host Liability

### Black Letter Law / Rule

[cite_start]A social host owes a duty of reasonable care to third parties if they serve alcohol to a guest knowing that the guest is intoxicated and will effectively be operating a motor vehicle[cite: 793].

### Key Cases

- **Kelly v. Gwinnell**
  - **Facts:** A host served a guest drinks. [cite_start]The guest drove home intoxicated and caused a head-on collision with the plaintiff[cite: 764].
  - **Holding:** The host is liable. [cite_start]Serving alcohol to an intoxicated guest who is known to be driving increases the risk of physical harm to foreseeable plaintiffs (other drivers/pedestrians)[cite: 789, 792].

### Nuance & Policy

- **"Pick Your Poison":** A host might fear being sued for "False Imprisonment" if they take a guest's keys or physically stop them. [cite_start]However, legally and ethically, risking a false imprisonment claim is preferable to the liability and moral cost of the guest injuring or killing someone[cite: 813, 823].

# Duty to Warn / Continuing Duty

### Black Letter Law / Rule

[cite_start]If a defendant's prior conduct (even if non-negligent at the time) creates a continuing risk of harm, the defendant owes a continuing affirmative duty to warn or rescue the plaintiff once the risk is discovered[cite: 869].

### Key Cases

- **Trezmer v. Barke**
  - **Facts:** Doctor implanted a Dalkon Shield. At the time, it was considered safe. Years later, it was found to be dangerous. [cite_start]The doctor failed to warn the patient[cite: 856].
  - [cite_start]**Holding:** The doctor owed a duty to warn the patient of the newly discovered risk[cite: 870].

# Duty of Universities (Moral vs. Physical Safety)

### Black Letter Law / Rule

Universities generally assume a duty regarding the **physical safety** of students in controlled areas (like dorms). [cite_start]However, they owe **no duty** to protect adult students from "moral decay" or the social influences/activities of their peers off-campus[cite: 951, 956].

### Key Cases

- **Hegel**
  - [cite_start]**Facts:** Parents sued a university alleging it failed to protect their daughter from falling into a "low life" and bad influences[cite: 940, 944].
  - **Holding:** The university was not liable. [cite_start]Protection from assault/robbery is a distinct legal duty from protection against moral failure or social vices[cite: 953].

# Duty to Rescue / Aggravation of Injury

### Black Letter Law / Rule

[cite_start]**General Rule:** There is no general duty to rescue a stranger in peril[cite: 988, 1007]. [cite_start]**Exception:** If the defendant controls the instrumentality causing the injury, or has a special relationship, a duty arises to take affirmative steps to prevent **aggravation** of the injury[cite: 990, 1003].

### Key Cases

- **L.S. Ayres & Co. v. Hicks**
  - **Facts:** A 6-year-old boy got his fingers caught in a department store escalator. [cite_start]The store delayed shutting it down, aggravating the injury[cite: 983, 986].
  - [cite_start]**Holding:** The store was not liable for the _initial_ injury (finger getting caught) but was liable for the _aggravation_ of the injury because they controlled the escalator (instrumentality) and failed to stop it reasonably quickly[cite: 994, 999].

# Duty to Third Parties (Mental Health Professionals)

### Black Letter Law / Rule

While doctor-patient confidentiality is a strong privilege, it is overridden when a therapist determines (or should determine) that a patient poses a **serious danger of violence** to a specific third party. [cite_start]In such cases, the therapist owes a duty to warn the intended victim or law enforcement[cite: 1142, 1146].

### Key Cases

- **Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California**
  - **Facts:** A patient (Poddar) told his psychologist at UC he intended to kill Tatiana Tarasoff. The police released him; he later killed her. [cite_start]No one warned Tatiana or her parents[cite: 1118, 1124].
  - **Holding:** The university/therapists were liable. Protective privilege ends where the public peril begins. [cite_start]This created the requirement for "Tarasoff Warnings"[cite: 1151].

# Pure Economic Loss (The Physical Impact Rule)

### Black Letter Law / Rule

[cite_start]**The Physical Impact Rule:** In the absence of physical impact (to the plaintiff's person or property), there is **no duty of care** for pure economic loss[cite: 1299, 1306].

### Hypotheticals & Examples

- **The 101 Freeway Crash:**
  - **Scenario:** Driver A negligently rear-ends Driver B. This causes a 3-mile traffic jam. [cite_start]A florist 1 mile back is stuck for 2 hours, and \$10,000 worth of flowers wilt (economic loss)[cite: 1264].
  - **Outcome:** Driver A is liable to Driver B (physical impact/injury). Driver A is **not** liable to the Florist. [cite_start]Although the loss was foreseeable and caused by the negligence, duty cuts off liability because there was no physical impact to the florist[cite: 1331, 1361].

# Pure Emotional Distress (Preview)

- [cite_start]**Note:** While discussed briefly, the main cases for _Pure Emotional Distress_ (as opposed to economic loss) are **Daley** [cite: 1230] [cite_start]and **Thing**[cite: 1231]. These govern negligent infliction of emotional distress (NIED) and third-party bystander recovery.
