# Property - Session 09

## Transcript

John Rogers: Alright,

John Rogers: So, I got through every essay, but I believe that there might be 3 essays that students that I didn't get to that sent me, so if you haven't gotten feedback, I know that there's one gentleman

John Rogers: that I said I would get to, and I didn't. But just in case, just resend me.

John Rogers: An essay if you sent it to me.

John Rogers: resend it, and I'll get through it, tomorrow.

John Rogers: Resend it.

John Rogers: Resend it.

John Rogers: There is, real property mentoring going on, so I don't know when it is. I think it's actually at 1 o'clock on Wednesdays.

John Rogers: To try your best to make it, did anybody go to that?

Yessenia Soria: I did, Professor.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Yeah, yeah.

John Rogers: You could write me a private message, that's fine.

John Rogers: Let me know what you think.

John Rogers: I also teach evidence, and there's no mentoring for, like, another 3 weeks.

John Rogers: So, I told my class that I would just mentor them on Saturdays. I know that's evidence it's not property, but if you guys want to just come in on Saturday, it's from 10 to 12, and ask me any property questions, you can do that too. It's kind of just open if you want to come in.

John Rogers: I was just gonna go over some essays with them.

John Rogers: So, if you're interested, I could just send you guys a link. It's my own private Zoom link, and I will be in my house.

John Rogers: So, and it's only until evidence mentoring starts.

John Rogers: So if you want to ask me property questions… Come on in!

John Rogers: If you're taking contracts with Dean Frickberg, you can always ask him property questions, too.

John Rogers: You absolutely can.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Any?

John Rogers: Questions at all?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Yeah, Professor, is it starting this Saturday, your evidence mentoring class?

John Rogers: Yeah, from 10 to, 12.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Because I went over state of mind with my class last night, and that is tough. Whoo! That is tough. I got caught flat-footed on, like, two of the problems.

John Rogers: So that's when I said, okay, if I'm getting caught up on those two, everyone else must be lost.

John Rogers: Anyways, any… property questions?

Yessenia Soria: Can we, do, like, a little brief,

Yessenia Soria: review from last week's, because I am lost.

John Rogers: I bet you're the only one.

John Rogers: You must be the only one. There must be something wrong with you, because you must be the only one lost.

Yessenia Soria: I know.

John Rogers: Course.

John Rogers: Okay, but I have to finish The Rule Against Perpetuities. After tonight, you can pretty much do quite a number of essays.

John Rogers: after… maybe… part of tonight, you might be able to do 50% of the essays I sent you.

John Rogers: So you can… Get to work on this?

John Rogers: Any other questions?

Yessenia Soria: No, so the mentoring was… the guys are smart.

Yessenia Soria: But the problem was that the other professor, I guess, started from the ends.

Yessenia Soria: They started with tenants and lease, and the other guy wanted to start with

Yessenia Soria: Adverse possession, so they weren't, like, in the same page, so… Yeah.

Yessenia Soria: But I have…

John Rogers: That sucks.

John Rogers: Well, these go and ask questions.

John Rogers: potentially landlord-tenant, which is the final few classes, is very practical. You can conceptualize it. A lot of times, people,

John Rogers: I've had a landlord, or they are a landlord.

John Rogers: So, they can kind of,

John Rogers: Conceptualize things a lot better than… detail, and…

John Rogers: Doctrine of worthier title, and destructibility of contingent remainers.

John Rogers: Okay, anything else?

Yessenia Soria: Can we go over the remainders also?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: what,

John Rogers: Here's the thing, it sounds like you want me just to do an entire review of future interests.

Yessenia Soria: No, just where we went, like, a little bit from last week.

John Rogers: Because I'm getting confused where…

Yessenia Soria: Actually, I did write a question that I was gonna ask you. One of the,

Yessenia Soria: one of the chapters… one of the chapters I was reviewing, It was on page… Wait, I don't know.

Yessenia Soria: I wrote it somewhere.

Yessenia Soria: Well, it was, like, when A and B, and then the B's kids, and they didn't… it didn't go through, and then C came in, that's where I was lost.

Yessenia Soria: Let me find the page, and I'll get back to you.

John Rogers: Okay.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, can you explain executory interests, like, more of, like, a story, so I can understand, not just by memorizing this, this, and that, like, how it relates to,

Fatima Razavi: B, simple, determinable, and FS… FSSCS, and FSSEL. Is it because…

Fatima Razavi: They will for sure have the land.

Fatima Razavi: So they have an executory interest, because it's going to be with them forever.

John Rogers: Don't worry. Well, once upon a time.

John Rogers: There was either a group of individuals, an individual, or… an entity.

John Rogers: That's sole purpose is to divest a prior owner.

John Rogers: Take it from them.

John Rogers: And they just hang out.

John Rogers: And wait!

John Rogers: And wait and wait.

John Rogers: Either forever, or… For their life.

John Rogers: And if at any time, they… Fulfill a condition…

John Rogers: That would allow them to divest, or… a grantee… violates a provision.

John Rogers: The executory interest holder will take it from them. So, we need an example.

Fatima Razavi: But they couldn't take it from a life estate?

John Rogers: Of course they can.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, because I had it written that it was only for FSC, so it can also be for life estate.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, that's why I had messed up.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: Oh.

John Rogers: Whatever.

John Rogers: There we go.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Presumably has an FSA. A has a present possessory interest in a life estate, with A being the measuring life, right?

John Rogers: What does B have?

Fatima Razavi: I would say the same thing as A.

Amir Akbari: Life is still subject to executatory conduct.

John Rogers: What's this right here?

Yessenia Soria: Is that get your interest?

Amir Akbari: this.

John Rogers: What does B have?

Yessenia Soria: Protect your interest on FSA?

John Rogers: B. B.

Amir Akbari: Life… life estate, right?

John Rogers: It's a future interest that will last for the duration of B's life.

John Rogers: Remember.

Amir Akbari: Dream it.

John Rogers: It's what? It's either an executor interest or a…

Amir Akbari: Because that cuts her…

Yessenia Soria: Secretary interest in life?

Jude Seleck: wasted remainder.

Jude Seleck: Subject to complete divestment.

John Rogers: just absolutely melted my heart. Yes!

John Rogers: It's a vested remainder Subject to total or complete.

John Rogers: Divestment in life.

John Rogers: Because, look!

John Rogers: A's going to get it no matter what. A is ascertainable, and A… sorry, B is ascertainable, and…

John Rogers: Not subject to any condition.

John Rogers: So B's going to get it.

John Rogers: But if B, B's going to get it, but B is subject to having it completely taken from B,

John Rogers: if C gets an A-plus in property.

John Rogers: Which means that C… Has what?

John Rogers: Remember, it's taking something from someone.

Karen Hernandez: The shifting executory interest?

John Rogers: Shifting executory interest in fee or life.

Karen Hernandez: in life.

John Rogers: In phi!

John Rogers: Correct!

John Rogers: So, why would C not have A contingent remainder.

Amir Akbari: Because it's not automatically coming back to the… Going to the sea.

Karen Hernandez: Because we don't know if C for sure will get an A+.

John Rogers: But the way that you answer that is, could be a contingent remainder.

John Rogers: Notice here, it says, then to be for life.

John Rogers: But if C, it doesn't say then to C if C gets an A-plus in property, because if it said then to C, it would mean upon the death of B, it would go to C, if C gets an A-plus in property. But it says BUT…

John Rogers: So, it's going to be, however…

John Rogers: If C gets the A-plus in property, then it's actually going to C. C will get it.

John Rogers: That's what separates it from a contingent remainder, so let's go contingent remainder, okay? So, O2A for life.

John Rogers: Then, to be for life, than to see if C gets an A-plus in real property.

John Rogers: Okay? So notice here, O has presumably a fee-simple absolute, A has a present possessory interest in a life estate with A being the measuring life, okay? And what does B have?

Jude Seleck: wasted remainder.

Jude Seleck: With B being the measuring life.

John Rogers: What kind of vested remainder? Because there's 3 kinds.

Clarissa Terrazas: Subject to complete divestment.

Amir Akbari: Subject to open.

John Rogers: This is subject to complete divestment here.

John Rogers: But notice the language says.

John Rogers: O to A for life, then to B for life, and then when B dies, it goes to C.

Sennett Devermont: Contingent remainder?

John Rogers: will be… So, no one's taking anything from B.

John Rogers: B is named, B does… is not subject to any conditions.

John Rogers: B is guaranteed to get this, right?

Fatima Razavi: Would it be the same as A?

John Rogers: Whoa.

John Rogers: A has a present possessory interest in a life estate, so B doesn't have a present possessory interest, it's a future interest. What type of future interest?

Karen Hernandez: Is it indefeasible vested remainder?

John Rogers: 1200 IQ, that is.

John Rogers: In fee or life?

Karen Hernandez: In life.

John Rogers: Correct.

John Rogers: But what does C have?

Jude Seleck: contingent remainder.

John Rogers: Correct! A contingent remainder in fear of life.

Fatima Razavi: J.

John Rogers: and feed… It's then to see. It's not then to see for life.

John Rogers: Now, there's a chance that C may never get an A+, no matter how hard C tries, no matter how hard C studies, no matter how hard it is the dream of C to get that A+, C may never, ever get it.

John Rogers: So… what's going to happen? What's automatically created? Because a contingent remainder may never be satisfied.

Karen Hernandez: reversion.

John Rogers: Correct. Who said that?

John Rogers: version. Oh, has a reversion. So after…

John Rogers: If C never fulfills this, it's gonna go back to O.

John Rogers: Okay, let's go back up here.

John Rogers: O2A for life, but if… B gets an A+.

John Rogers: O… what does O have? Presumably has an FSA? A has what? This is a tricky one. What does A have? It's not like we've said it a million times.

doven: Imagine life.

doven: Life estate.

John Rogers: It's the,

John Rogers: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, oh, wait, wait, wait, no, wait, no, no, this is wrong.

John Rogers: That's wrong.

John Rogers: That is wrong!

John Rogers: That is wrong.

John Rogers: I was incorrect. Please purchase your lottery tickets, because for once in my lifetime, I am incorrect.

John Rogers: What does A have?

gevorg kulikyan: A vested remainder subject to total divestment.

John Rogers: Well, A has it right now, right?

gevorg kulikyan: Oh, to me.

John Rogers: So, A has a present possessory interest.

John Rogers: So what type of present possessory interest does A have?

John Rogers: A vested remainder is a future interest.

John Rogers: Well, remember…

Fatima Razavi: State is, subject to executory?

John Rogers: Beautiful! Absolutely 1300 IQ, okay?

John Rogers: has a, life estate, subject to executory?

John Rogers: Limitation in fear life.

John Rogers: Oh, it's, it's… yeah, I'm sorry, Life Estates, okay, alright, yeah.

John Rogers: And B has what?

gevorg kulikyan: Does B have the vested remainder subject to total divestment?

John Rogers: Well… What's a remainder?

doven: Intention.

John Rogers: Be very close attention.

John Rogers: to this.

John Rogers: very close attention.

gevorg kulikyan: I'll be alive right now.

Amir Akbari: Object? Subject to complete.

John Rogers: So B is subject to complete divestment? B is subject to having…

Jude Seleck: Do you think executor interest in life?

Sennett Devermont: A spr… did he say springing executory interest?

John Rogers: Is it shifting?

John Rogers: Boom.

Sennett Devermont: Springy.

John Rogers: And what does O have?

John Rogers: Remember, it's then to be for life.

John Rogers: Notice here, it's taking it from A. It doesn't say then to B if B gets.

John Rogers: Because if it said then to be, that would be a remainder. But it says… But if…

John Rogers: B ever gets an A-plus in property.

John Rogers: than to B, which means that B can take it from A even when A is alive.

John Rogers: if B ever gets that A+.

doven: So, shifting is with Grantee and the, springing…

John Rogers: Springing is taking it from the grantee, and springing is taking it from the grantor.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: Yeah, this is subject to… The rule against perpetuities, rap.

John Rogers: Well, a million points in the game, is it… Void or valid?

John Rogers: Just take a guess.

Jude Seleck: Valid.

John Rogers: 1400 IQ.

John Rogers: valid.

John Rogers: The reason is this, is this gonna go on forever?

John Rogers: No, it's only gonna go on for the duration, maximum duration, of B's life.

John Rogers: So if everyone dies in a plane crash.

John Rogers: Who cares? There's no heirs to take it over.

John Rogers: So, it will either vest, Or fail to vest.

John Rogers: within B's own life. It's valid.

John Rogers: So, for wrap.

John Rogers: When you have a discussion, I'll fill you in. For exam purposes, it… you just say this.

John Rogers: Possible.

John Rogers: or possibility, 21 years?

John Rogers: Vest or fail to vest?

John Rogers: You say these words, okay? You don't say vet…

John Rogers: just pick one, possible or possibility, 21 years, and vest or fail to vest. You write anything you possibly want in between those words, and you'll get full points, okay?

John Rogers: Full points.

Fatima Razavi: Can we go through that one more time, please?

John Rogers: Go through what one more time?

John Rogers: Of this, right here? Of its valid?

Fatima Razavi: Yes, how do you figured it was valid?

John Rogers: Okay, well, first off, Perpetuity means it's gonna be floating around forever, and we don't know.

John Rogers: We don't know! We don't know! We have no idea what's gonna happen! It's just gonna be floating around forever and ever and ever and ever until the end of time.

John Rogers: In this case, is B's Executory.

Fatima Razavi: Sorry to interrupt you. What is floating around forever? If B dies, it goes back to O.

John Rogers: There you go! So that's why it's valid, so it's not going to be floating around forever. The maximum amount of time this will ever be floating around is B's life.

Fatima Razavi: So if it's under…

John Rogers: going on in perpetuity forever until the end of time, it's only going to last for the duration of B's life. So if B gets on that plane to Romania and dies, then there we go, it's done, it's over with. We don't think about it anymore.

John Rogers: B's interest is not floating around forever.

John Rogers: It's only…

doven: No.

doven: Go ahead. Wouldn't all these go into, rules on perpetuities, because they got contingent remainder and executive entries?

John Rogers: All this is, I just never went into wrapping these.

John Rogers: Only some of them I did. I still have to complete the lecture on REP, I still haven't done that.

John Rogers: But I did for this. It's an executory interest, so it's subject to the rule against perpetuities.

Amir Akbari: Can you explain one more time, B, how it's shifting executory, and it's not, subject to complete?

Amir Akbari: I didn't get that.

John Rogers: Well.

Amir Akbari: Please.

John Rogers: Subject to B.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, how B is shifting executory, and it's not subject to complete.

John Rogers: Well, first… Remainder.

doven: Yeah.

John Rogers: B… B doesn't have a remainder.

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

Amir Akbari: I thought he has a remainder, because B has a condition, right?

John Rogers: Well… Rule.

John Rogers: For a remainder.

Amir Akbari: As I told you guys, and this isn't…

John Rogers: This is…

Amir Akbari: transfer links.

John Rogers: Everyone in this class. I told you about the rule. What is the rule for a remainder? A rule for a remainder says

John Rogers: capable?

John Rogers: Of becoming possessory upon the natural expiration.

John Rogers: So, natural expiration of A's death.

John Rogers: B could get it well before A's death.

John Rogers: It doesn't say, than to B if B gets an A-plus in property, whereas it says here, remember?

John Rogers: Then, to see if C gets an A-plus in property, that's a contingent remainder, it's a remainder.

John Rogers: This can happen well before A ever dies.

Amir Akbari: So, because, B could get that before the natural expiration, it's not a remainder.

John Rogers: Correct, that's correct. Yes.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: Questions?

Fatima Razavi: Yeah, can you show what an invalid one would look like in the same exact situation? Would it be where you say, then be, without saying for life?

John Rogers: Fine, it'd still be valid.

Fatima Razavi: Then how would you have an invalid version of the same sentence, please?

John Rogers: This is still valid.

John Rogers: Reason is this, it's if B gets an A-plus in property, then to B.

John Rogers: Problem is, is that it doesn't say if anyone ever in the history of the world ever gets an A-plus on property, it's B.

John Rogers: So if B dies, it's… no one is subject to getting it, it's only B. So it's still within B's life. So if even… B gets on that plane to go to Romania and dies, then, sorry, you never got that A+, you don't take it.

John Rogers: So it's valid. So it will vest, or fail to vest, within B's, like.

doven: So what would… can you show one where it's invalid?

John Rogers: Well, I showed you, I mean, I showed you last week, and I'll go over rap again, I'm gonna… I haven't finished lecturing on it, but I'm more focused on these than wrap right now, okay?

John Rogers: What I lecture on for wrap are the common pitfalls.

John Rogers: That's what I want you to know.

John Rogers: Questions other than the rule against perpetuities?

doven: So, remainder is then to… then to be in, ticker interest is.

doven: No, Executive Interest has been… To, contingent is, A little confused.

John Rogers: What are you confused about? Because, you know what?

John Rogers: You must be the only confused one in this class.

John Rogers: Because everyone else has got it. They don't say anything. No one says a word, which tells me they got it. They got this cold. They are on top of it.

Yessenia Soria: So what's your question? I'm behind Dovin.

John Rogers: So what's the question again, exactly?

doven: So, contingent remainder, I'm just… I was trying to memorize, so it's… it's like…

doven: Then to be… than… than to see…

John Rogers: We'll do it like this.

John Rogers: property.

John Rogers: There you go.

John Rogers: O has an FSA, A has a pre-obsessory interest in a life estate, with A being the measuring life.

John Rogers: And then… B has one.

doven: It's a… it's a vested remainder.

John Rogers: Well…

John Rogers: B is ascertained, so B is named. We know who B is, right? Yeah. And it's B subject to any conditions that B must fulfill prior to taking.

doven: Yeah, it is subject.

John Rogers: what is the condition that B must fulfill?

doven: A+.

John Rogers: So, it is contingent upon A getting that A+.

John Rogers: before A dies.

doven: On the continual remainder.

John Rogers: contingent remainder. And since it ends with a contingent remainder, what is O gonna automatically have, then?

doven: version.

John Rogers: Correct a reversion.

John Rogers: Now…

John Rogers: This is subject to rap, and I'll tell you right, is it valid or void? Take a wild guess. Anyone out there in real property land, tell me, what do you think?

Sennett Devermont: Boyd.

John Rogers: Valid.

John Rogers: Remember, this ain't gonna be floating around forever.

John Rogers: is B's interest Gonna be floating around Forever and ever and ever.

John Rogers: Will it? I mean, will…

doven: I mean…

John Rogers: Interest, be able to watch the pyramids blow away sand, like, disintegrate one day?

doven: What is A to light, and then to B.

John Rogers: So, this condition… I'm sorry, contingent remainder in FSA.

John Rogers: This contingent remainder will only last for the duration of… how long will this last?

John Rogers: How long will it go on for? What's the maximum amount of period?

Amir Akbari: Life of A.

John Rogers: Life of being.

Amir Akbari: B…

John Rogers: If B dies, are B's heirs going to get it and have to get an A-plus in property? No, it says then to B if E gets the A-plus.

doven: class.

John Rogers: So if B is dead.

Amir Akbari: And how about the life of A? Because even if the A dies, then…

Amir Akbari: It's gonna come back to O, right?

John Rogers: it will go back to O, because that would be a common law version of the destructibility of contingent remainers that we heard last week.

John Rogers: when the… B's interests did not vest.

John Rogers: before A's death, which means it destructs.

John Rogers: So what generally happens is it goes back to O,

John Rogers: And then B's interest becomes a springing executory interest.

Fatima Razavi: This doesn't go to B's heirs?

Fatima Razavi: This is a fee simple, right?

John Rogers: If B gets the A+,

John Rogers: B will have it in… before A dies, as an indefeasible vested remainder in fee simple absolute. So once B dies, it goes to B's heirs. But B must get that A+.

Fatima Razavi: And where does the 21 years fall into all of this?

John Rogers: Just pretend everyone dies.

John Rogers: And will the interest vest or fail to vest within 21 years after everyone dies on a plane crash on the way to Romania?

John Rogers: Well, yeah, it will fail to vest.

John Rogers: B's will vest or fail to vest within B's own life. We don't even care what happens after B dies, because B's heirs don't take over.

John Rogers: It's just… B.

John Rogers: So let it be.

John Rogers: I'm not understanding this, so bees… You know, I told you not to try to understand, just know this is when… what happens.

John Rogers: Okay?

Fatima Razavi: I hear you, but I'm not getting… when he gets an A+.

John Rogers: It could be a he's she.

Fatima Razavi: whatever we call it, a them. When them gets an A+,

Fatima Razavi: Then it goes to all their heirs.

John Rogers: Yep.

Fatima Razavi: So then, how does the 21 years fall into play?

John Rogers: Does B get the A-plus?

Fatima Razavi: Yes.

John Rogers: Then done. Whatever, who cares? Getting fee, simple, absolute, no one cares, there's no wrap discussion, it's goodbye!

Fatima Razavi: Got it. Thank you.

John Rogers: But it's measured at the time of creation, not what happens later. It's at the time of creation.

John Rogers: So, is there possibility? So you have to run possibilities.

John Rogers: Is it possible At the time of creation, not what actually happens.

John Rogers: But at the time, it's measured at the time of creation.

doven: Can we get a copy of the…

John Rogers: No, absolutely not. I don't give copies of my notes.

John Rogers: Yes, you'll get a copy, absolutely, don't worry. There's much more to write.

Jude Seleck: Professor, I have a question. If it is a will, then it is not at the time of creation, but,

Jude Seleck: when all dies, right? That's where we start measuring.

John Rogers: Well, not necessarily O can… convey something by deed when O is still alive.

Jude Seleck: Okay.

John Rogers: But if it's by… will.

Jude Seleck: When it is right, yeah.

John Rogers: it's measured at O's death then, because a will doesn't become operative until death.

Jude Seleck: at Olstead, because we know the heirs, so they're no longer uncertainable, right?

John Rogers: Well, O's errors.

Jude Seleck: All the years, yeah.

Jude Seleck: Oh, yeah.

Jude Seleck: Alright.

Sennett Devermont: Could you repeat the one sentence about shifting and springing, and how, like, the grantor-grantee, which one it goes… which one?

John Rogers: What do you mean?

Sennett Devermont: Well, you stated it pretty simply about shifting its…

Sennett Devermont: It's to the grantor, and then springing, it's from the grantee tour?

John Rogers: Yes. So, an executor interest that's taking it from a grantee, It's shifting.

John Rogers: But if it ever takes it from the grantor, It's spring.

John Rogers: Even, like, springing over to take something from the grantor.

John Rogers: All… Give you some… examples. So, tattoo that to your brain tonight.

John Rogers: I want you to… to answer…

John Rogers: an example I'll give.

John Rogers: Don't tattoo it yourself. Definitely want to go see a tattoo professional if you're getting something tattooed on your brain.

John Rogers: I don't think anyone laughs at that. Questions?

John Rogers: Alex, are you getting this? I was told to call on you tonight.

Alex Poberezhskiy: Was it from Ida?

John Rogers: Oh, I'm… I was… I… I… I… wasn't supposed to say who.

John Rogers: So I, I promise… person, I wouldn't say.

Alex Poberezhskiy: I'm hanging in here.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: If you're scared, just shoot me a private message. Anyone that's scared. Shoot me a private message.

John Rogers: What I want to do is go back to the lecture of rap.

John Rogers: Because I was not finished.

John Rogers: Someone's petrified.

John Rogers: Someone said that they are petrified.

John Rogers: It's gonna know you're gonna be okay.

John Rogers: Gonna be okay.

Amir Akbari: Can we do a quick review on the future interest, then go to the rock, please?

John Rogers: A review of future interests?

Amir Akbari: Yes.

Amir Akbari: Then go to the route.

John Rogers: Well, I'm gonna be going into the casebook, so, I mean, I really would like to get through the wrap discussion first, and then you guys can ask me all

John Rogers: you want.

John Rogers: So… Rule against Burpituities.

John Rogers: O?

John Rogers: 2A… and her heirs, so long as Black Acre is used

John Rogers: For residential purposes, otherwise to be and his heirs.

John Rogers: presumably has an FSA, has,

John Rogers: B is simple subject to executive limitations, and B has what?

John Rogers: Oh.

John Rogers: Boy.

John Rogers: Oh, boy.

John Rogers: Oh, holy.

John Rogers: Oh, boy!

John Rogers: Oh, boy.

John Rogers: What is BF?

Sennett Devermont: Boy, nothing?

John Rogers: What does B have? Just, what does B have?

John Rogers: Like, what…

Jude Seleck: Clink executor interest.

John Rogers: Yes! Oh!

John Rogers: Thank you.

John Rogers: Then we apply wrap, and THEN I heard it before, what does wrap do in this situation? Every. Single. Time.

Jude Seleck: invalid.

John Rogers: Yep, Boyd.

John Rogers: Every time.

John Rogers: I threw in, and her air heirs here.

John Rogers: Does it satisfy common law?

John Rogers: You don't have to do it here, this is… we're back to iPhone law.

John Rogers: What does Ahav?

Jude Seleck: These simple subject, condition subsequent.

John Rogers: Los…

Fatima Razavi: Executory limitations?

John Rogers: Yes, it's executory limitation.

John Rogers: What does B have?

Mireya Gonzalez: Is it an executor interest?

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: In what? Fear Life.

Mireya Gonzalez: Fee?

Fatima Razavi: Peace.

John Rogers: Correct!

John Rogers: Now, we apply wrap, because you then have to look at the validity of the interest. Is it valid or void?

Karen Hernandez: Boy.

John Rogers: It is Boyd. Now, here's what I want to know.

John Rogers: What happens, then?

John Rogers: This is what I went over.

John Rogers: There's something that happens in this example versus this one.

John Rogers: So, in this one, if rap…

John Rogers: voids out B's interest, okay? It's gone. Goodbye! It's goodbye! Hello!

John Rogers: Oops.

John Rogers: It's gone.

John Rogers: then A…

John Rogers: enter so long as black can be used for residential purposes. If RAP voids that, then O has a possibility of reverter, right?

John Rogers: Because it's just a fee-simple determinable. A would just have a fee-simple determinable, so this…

John Rogers: Fee simple subject to executory limitation would transpose to… A fee simple determinable.

John Rogers: But… What about here?

gevorg kulikyan: Does the condition go away in this one, Professor?

John Rogers: So what happened?

gevorg kulikyan: So then it's just O to A, phi simple absolute.

John Rogers: 1300 IQ.

John Rogers: This situation is different.

John Rogers: Because once rap voids B's interest, It tackles the entire Conveyance after the comma.

John Rogers: Which means that all this is gone, which means that A has it, and B, simple, absolute.

John Rogers: That.

John Rogers: Be very careful.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: What does A have?

doven: F-S-S-E-L.

John Rogers: Yes! But just say, only lasts for the duration.

John Rogers: of bee's life.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: this… defeasible fee will only last for the duration of B's life, because…

John Rogers: It only attaches to these lines.

John Rogers: So B has what?

doven: Who's a vested?

John Rogers: Well, I… then to be for life, just say in the event, okay, if Blake… if Blackacre is used for anything other than residential purposes.

John Rogers: then it goes… then it… then Black Acre will go to be for life.

John Rogers: So, the then doesn't mean upon…

doven: Oh, yeah, you're right.

John Rogers: Yeah, so…

doven: In June.

John Rogers: So you said a contingent remainder?

doven: possible.

John Rogers: Yeah.

doven: It's not guaranteed that… B will get it for life.

doven: So.

Jude Seleck: Executor interests.

John Rogers: Correct!

John Rogers: And fear life.

Mireya Gonzalez: Life.

John Rogers: In life, because it says to be for life. So then, this is an executor interest, so we have to apply the rule against perpetuities. And is B's interest… B's interest is…

Karen Hernandez: Valid.

John Rogers: These interests is valid!

John Rogers: Because it's not gonna go on forever and ever. It will only go on for the maximum duration of B's life.

John Rogers: So if everyone goes on that plane to Romania and dies in the Atlantic Ocean, and somehow survived the plane crash, but get eaten by sharks, and they're about 4 miles off the coast of Western Africa, so they'll get eaten by alligators or crocodiles, saltwater crocodiles. So they're just dead.

John Rogers: Doesn't matter.

John Rogers: Because it's never gonna go beyond B's life.

John Rogers: So it's valid. So this interest will vest or fail to vest within B's life.

John Rogers: it's… valid.

John Rogers: But since it's only in light, O will retain a reversion.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: We have extensively covered executory interests

John Rogers: That are subject to the rule against perpetuities.

John Rogers: There's another common pitfall.

John Rogers: for wrap.

John Rogers: And it's applied to class gifts.

John Rogers: Or contingent remainder, so vested remainder subject to open.

John Rogers: And,

John Rogers: class gifts. Class gifts could be…

John Rogers: Really anything, it's a class gift, but we could say vested remainder subject to open, or contingent remainders.

John Rogers: And that is…

John Rogers: Void, always void.

John Rogers: This is something that you need to contact your local

John Rogers: tattoo artist. I don't care if he or she lives…

John Rogers: In the back of a 7-Eleven.

John Rogers: You need to get this tattooed to that thing between your eyes, your brain.

John Rogers: Between your eyes. Behind your eyes.

John Rogers: Anytime UC.

John Rogers: a condition.

John Rogers: Where?

John Rogers: An individual or individuals.

John Rogers: Must reach the age of 22.

John Rogers: Or more.

John Rogers: It's always… Void.

John Rogers: Always void.

John Rogers: Let's just say B has… Two children! Oh! How darling.

John Rogers: C equals… 17, and…

John Rogers: D is 21.

John Rogers: How beautiful. Oh.

John Rogers: Anyways…

John Rogers: What do they have?

John Rogers: Oh, God.

John Rogers: What do they have?

doven: of measuring life.

Mireya Gonzalez: The president possesses… possessory interests in the life estate.

doven: Hey, being a veteran life.

John Rogers: Oh, sorry, these children.

John Rogers: Have what?

Jude Seleck: contingent remainder?

John Rogers: Correct in your life.

Jude Seleck: B.

John Rogers: So, since it's possible that the children may never reach the age of 22, O will automatically have what?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Reversing.

John Rogers: Correct.

John Rogers: So, let's apply the rule against perpetuities to this.

John Rogers: Scenario right here.

John Rogers: So this is the critical thing.

John Rogers: for a billion Extra credit points that go to nothing?

John Rogers: Is rap going to void?

John Rogers: Or is this… will it be valid? Will these children's interests be valid or void?

Yessenia Soria: void.

John Rogers: Why would you say that?

Yessenia Soria: Because you said if it says 22 or more, it has to be void.

John Rogers: Correct!

John Rogers: Correct!

John Rogers: It's void. So, B's… children's interest.

John Rogers: is… Boyd!

John Rogers: 22 or more.

John Rogers: If it says 21, that does not count.

John Rogers: It's VALID.

John Rogers: But if it's 22 or more… Boyd. Every time.

John Rogers: What are you talking about? I don't get it, because D…

John Rogers: Dee's 21! Ugh! Dee is 21!

John Rogers: So what?

John Rogers: Remember, the rule against perpetuities is measured At the time of creation.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: Let's assume a possible Scenario.

John Rogers: Let's assume that O, A, and B's children, B and C, And B,

John Rogers: They all get on a plane!

John Rogers: And where are they going? Tell me a place. Where are they all going?

Fatima Razavi: Hawaii.

doven: to me.

John Rogers: I heard Hawaii.

John Rogers: What part of Hawaii, exactly?

Fatima Razavi: Now we…

John Rogers: Okay, they're going to Kauai, not Maui. Sorry, Kauai. That's more localized spot, it's… sorry, there's no arguing with me. They're going to Kauai.

John Rogers: Alright?

John Rogers: Sadly, and I hope everyone got flowers for them, they're plain Crash, and everyone's dead.

John Rogers: They're all dead!

John Rogers: Their bodies are being eaten by sharks and fish.

John Rogers: Okay? That's what's happening to them.

John Rogers: But just before they got on that plane, okay?

John Rogers: B had a child.

John Rogers: Bea's child was fortunately Not on that plane.

John Rogers: How long?

John Rogers: Will it take that child

John Rogers: To fulfill this condition.

Fatima Razavi: Do we need to know the age of the child?

John Rogers: Just say the day before the child was born.

John Rogers: The day before the plane crashed, the child was born.

Fatima Razavi: So, 21 days and 360… sorry, 21 years and 364 days?

John Rogers: The rule against perpetuities voids out remote vesting.

John Rogers: So, would it take longer?

John Rogers: than 21 years.

John Rogers: For that child's interest, To become vested.

Fatima Razavi: Yes.

John Rogers: then it's void.

Jude Seleck: Professor, isn't this for common law in modern day, the class clauses?

Jude Seleck: At the time of… the creation.

John Rogers: There's moments… we'll get to that in just a second. I actually wasn't sure if I was going to lecture on this.

John Rogers: And I don't know if I gave you the rule of convenience for the rule against perpetuities or not, the…

Jude Seleck: Yes, it is in the notes, but…

John Rogers: In the notes under vested remainder, or is it in the notes under wrap?

Jude Seleck: I have to check.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: For right now, don't worry about that, but just know, under this scenario.

John Rogers: It's void every time.

John Rogers: 22 or more. 25, 29, 176.

John Rogers: But, if it says 21, it's valid.

John Rogers: Because it must… because it… the children must reach the age of 22.

John Rogers: So, is it possible that B could have a child

John Rogers: And would that child… would it take them longer than 21 years for their interest to vest? Yes, because they must reach the age of 22.

John Rogers: Well, it's void. Every time. So what would happen?

John Rogers: That interest is void, it's no longer… whatever, it's no longer there, so this conveyance just reads O2A for life.

John Rogers: There we go. That's it. That's all it is.

Mireya Gonzalez: Professor, I have a question. Had the, child been 22, that would still be void because of, where it says who reached the age of 22. So either if he would have been 22 or not, it's still void.

John Rogers: We'll get into that right now, okay? There is… I wasn't sure whether to. There are two… Things.

John Rogers: And that's the rule of convenience.

John Rogers: Versus all or nothing.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: I believe, and I know that you guys think I'm flawless and perfect in every way, it's… look, I don't blame you.

John Rogers: But I'm actually not sure What is the majority, and which one is the minority here?

John Rogers: I seem to think that the majority view

John Rogers: And common law view is the all-or-nothing rule.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Which means… That every single child has to reach The age of 22.

John Rogers: Otherwise, if one doesn't, the whole class is done.

John Rogers: Now… If… one child actually reaches the age of 22 before A's death?

John Rogers: Then that person's interest… the rule of convenience, in essence, says that the whole class will vest.

John Rogers: But then there's some jurisdictions that says, nope, only that person's interests will best. So it gets very, very, very, particular.

John Rogers: I don't think I'm gonna get that far into anything with you guys, because I think that's… that would probably be Real Property 3.

John Rogers: I don't think you guys ever want to take that class, because it's not offered, and who would take it?

John Rogers: But…

John Rogers: Think of the rule of convenience in a way as that if one member of the class, for example, if D reached the age of 22, then everyone vests, everyone's preserved, they're not going to be void.

John Rogers: Okay? The all-or-nothing rule is that every single member of the class must reach the age of 22.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: I am happy with just telling you It's always void.

John Rogers: I think by teaching you that, and you tattooing that to your brain.

John Rogers: You will never, ever call me 20 years from now and say.

John Rogers: Hey, you were wrong, and it just has ruined my law practice, and my life is ruined because you taught me that.

John Rogers: Now, there are certain exceptions to the rule against perpetuities, and this is very commonly tested.

John Rogers: This is very commonly tested.

John Rogers: Not commonly tested within this class, but you could have a multiple choice question on the bar, and that is charity to charity, okay?

John Rogers: So… The rule against perpetuities will not apply between charity to charity. Not private person to charity.

John Rogers: But charity to charity. So, Red Cross to,

John Rogers: So, with Red Cross to,

John Rogers: What's another charity? The Salvation Army.

John Rogers: There you go.

John Rogers: will not ever be void by rap.

John Rogers: So there's a rule. Charity to charity, Wrap is not applied.

John Rogers: Charity to charity, Wrap is not applied.

John Rogers: the approach… For the rule against perpetuities is exactly this.

John Rogers: common law, There you go. You apply the common law rule, and you apply exactly what we just did.

John Rogers: On everything we just did so far.

John Rogers: But what about iPhone law?

John Rogers: What about today law? What do you do?

John Rogers: Well, that's the, well, that's U.S. wrap, okay?

John Rogers: Uniform statutory Code of the rule against perpetuities, okay?

John Rogers: Or… You can say, us rap.

John Rogers: Like, we rap. We… we rap lyrics, us, okay? When you apply this modernly.

John Rogers: It says, first apply common law.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: If it still cannot be determined.

John Rogers: Then, you take the wait-and-see approach.

John Rogers: Which is, see what happens…

John Rogers: wait and see 21 years, and see if their interests, if they reach the age of 22 within 21 years. You apply the wait-and-see approach.

John Rogers: And then you, I don't know if there's a specific Heading for it. Shoot.

John Rogers: My apologies.

John Rogers: But it's wait 90 years.

John Rogers: I just don't know if there's a specific header for it, if I'm missing, I haven't looked at this in a year.

John Rogers: So I forgot, I'm sorry.

John Rogers: but wait 90 years, and see what happens. So one's the wait-and-see approach of 21 years, and you apply wait 90 years. The beauty of this is to only know for sure, wait 90 years, it kind of has to tell you. 90 years later.

John Rogers: So, That's it.

John Rogers: Now, there's the fertile octogenarian.

John Rogers: the unborn child, I think that might be an example that I put in my notes for you. Very complicated.

doven: Is this for charity charity, or is this just a different approach?

John Rogers: Charity to… no, no, no, no. This is totally separate. This is the approach.

John Rogers: rapid approach.

John Rogers: So this is totally different.

doven: We start off with common law, and then we…

John Rogers: So, think of it. So, if you look at a fact pattern, and you think, well, there's a chance that likely someone could own an iPhone in this fact pattern, then you apply

John Rogers: U.S. wrap, and you first apply the common law. And that's the common law rule, what we've just gone over and over and over.

John Rogers: And then, wait-and-see approach, which is 21 years, and then wait 90 years.

John Rogers: See, this is easy! I told you guys, it's not bad.

John Rogers: I didn't see this message that someone said, I'm still scared.

John Rogers: I didn't see that, though.

John Rogers: Questions?

John Rogers: But only 3 people wrote me a message. 3? That's it. 3 of you?

John Rogers: God, that's pretty good.

Yessenia Soria: Professor, on the 90 years, what did you say again? It's after its creation?

John Rogers: Wait 90 years and see if it interests bests.

Yessenia Soria: Well, I'm scared, and I'm still lost, I'm telling you. I don't need to message her.

John Rogers: Someone's terrified.

doven: I study a lot, and then it's like, when I come to class, my mind gets blank.

John Rogers: Someone's really good at hiding.

John Rogers: How terrified they are.

Yessenia Soria: So we could start doing the practice essays and send them to you, or… No.

John Rogers: You can start doing that, if you want.

John Rogers: About maybe 20% of them.

John Rogers: But you're done, so guys… You're at rock bottom! Wasn't so bad, was it?

John Rogers: You're kidding.

John Rogers: there's two girls that live across the street. When their parents are gone, they have parties, but they're in college, so they're… I guess they're just kind of home, because their parents are gone, so they're having a party.

John Rogers: I can hear a bunch of kids across the street.

John Rogers: Which means that when I wake up in the morning, there's probably gonna be, like, beer cans around my house. Anyways, which I don't care.

John Rogers: Questions?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Is there a particular essay that you think would be good out of all the ones you've given that would address all these things that we've done up to this point, or some or others that we should do?

John Rogers: Try… try question one. I think question one was poorly written by me, but try it.

Yessenia Soria: one that Oliver owns, Blackacre, and the fifth one?

John Rogers: Well, if it says Question 1, then, that's… that's it.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Does anyone know where my counterparts are in their… New…

John Rogers: Contact your friends in those classes and find out where they are.

John Rogers: Oh, I forgot. It's either… you either don't know anyone in those classes, or you just don't have any friends. And I think that you don't have any friends, so…

John Rogers: I don't know if anyone ever laughs, but…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I know people in Safari, and I don't really know anybody in Domaz.

John Rogers: No margin, okay.

John Rogers: I did admit to my, evidence class last night.

John Rogers: I think there might be only 2 students in this class, in my evidence class, that I could potentially

John Rogers: Have a two-sentence final exam.

John Rogers: But, I'll write it up, I'm probably not gonna do it. I'll write it up and…

John Rogers: Give it to you guys next week.

John Rogers: See, look, this was actually what I was thinking about doing.

John Rogers: We can go over it together.

John Rogers: I'll go over a couple more examples, how's that?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: When do you think you'll do an essay example in class?

John Rogers: Are you gonna… I'll go over Question 1 next week.

John Rogers: And I'll go over an essay at the beginning, or end of class.

John Rogers: Until you're final.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Okay, cool.

John Rogers: not multiple. So, like, the last, like…

John Rogers: 2 weeks, I'll go over, like, 8 of them.

John Rogers: I just don't know if I should record class or not.

maddykoshkaryan: Yes, yes.

Yessenia Soria: Do you want friends?

Mireya Gonzalez: Don't you have to?

maddykoshkaryan: On that note, can I ask you a question?

John Rogers: Yeah.

maddykoshkaryan: Why do they take forever to post them?

John Rogers: I don't know if I ever told you guys this, I don't know what happens if…

John Rogers: I just pressed buttons.

maddykoshkaryan: It's Melvis, or…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Emails…

John Rogers: Oh, there's still this.

maddykoshkaryan: Oh, sorry!

John Rogers: Elvis, how could you… From now on.

John Rogers: I want you guys, every time you email that, I don't know who it goes to, but apparently it goes to, like, 15 people.

maddykoshkaryan: No, it's Elvis, usually.

John Rogers: I… you don't understand. It… you send it to Elvis, but that email goes to 15 people, okay?

John Rogers: So I usually mess them, I say, like.

John Rogers: Dear Elvis, the king, I always knew you were haunting the halls. God, I'm such a fan, blah blah blah. When you have a second, can you send me the real property link? Thank you very much. I love you.

John Rogers: There's probably 15 people. I've been saying that for years. There's probably people that look at that and go, who is this dude?

John Rogers: Anyways… Was there a question?

Fatima Razavi: I kind of have a question, Professor.

Fatima Razavi: your O to A, the one that you said, only lasts for the duration of B's life.

Fatima Razavi: If that was…

Fatima Razavi: worded differently, owed A for life than to be for life? When would it be a per attruvie? Because I thought when you said it…

John Rogers: Where?

Fatima Razavi: The one that's right above children's, people, grandchildren… yeah, right there, you said for the dura… only loss for the duration of B's life. Isn't it when you do for… I know this is for a fee simple, but let's say if it was for a life estate.

John Rogers: Okay.

Fatima Razavi: Would that be, then, for our trivia?

John Rogers: No, because this is how it's used.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: And this only means that this could be taken away from A.

John Rogers: during B's life.

John Rogers: But it doesn't mean that A has this for the duration of B's life.

John Rogers: So if B dies in a car accident the next day, then this is all gone. A has it in fee simple absolute. It just says, only for the period of B's life, B has the ability to take it from A if Blackacre is used for anything other than residential purposes.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: Let's see who's a genius.

John Rogers: Who's gonna do this?

John Rogers: This one's a tricky one.

John Rogers: This one is a tricky one.

John Rogers: Write me a message if you're too scared to do it.

Jude Seleck: Does A have executory interest?

Jude Seleck: Oh.

Jude Seleck: Not shifting, but the other one gets… I mean, cuts off all's interest.

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: So what would O have, then?

John Rogers: What would O have?

Jude Seleck: It is simple, subject to complete divestment.

John Rogers: Mmm… not quite close.

John Rogers: You just didn't use the right words, but I know what you're getting at.

Jude Seleck: Subject to executive limits.

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: A would have a springing executory!

John Rogers: Interest… In phi simple absolute.

John Rogers: Notice here, A does not have this property.

John Rogers: A doesn't have it.

John Rogers: Because this is O2A IFA.

John Rogers: And it doesn't say, Once O dies, then 2A if A gets an A+. It's just 2A if A.

John Rogers: Which means that A has that executory interest, which will take it from O once A gets that A+.

John Rogers: And, if A… can take that from O,

John Rogers: At any time A gets that A+,

John Rogers: That means O doesn't have it in fee simple absolute. O has it in fee simple subject to the executory interest that A has.

John Rogers: Boom.

John Rogers: A has what?

Mireya Gonzalez: Is it F-S-S-E-L?

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: Heart is melting!

John Rogers: What does B have?

Alice Orozco: Executory interest?

John Rogers: In life or feet?

Alice Orozco: NC?

Fatima Razavi: In life.

John Rogers: I'm gonna, like… But, whoa, whoa…

John Rogers: I can't say that you're wrong.

John Rogers: But for right now, if we're only measuring this, then yes, it's for life.

John Rogers: What do bee's heirs have?

gevorg kulikyan: Executory interest and feet?

John Rogers: a contingent remainder in Psimple Absolute, because B's alive.

John Rogers: We don't know who B's heirs are until B is dead.

John Rogers: So, I guess there's a chance that B could potentially die without errors, which means that O has a reversion. Anytime you end with a contingent remainder, there's always a reversion in O.

John Rogers: So now we've determined what everybody has.

John Rogers: Now we determine what is the validity of these interests. So, is there something potentially going on

John Rogers: with B and B's heirs, Like, is there, like, a situation there?

gevorg kulikyan: I'm thinking of, like, the Shelley's case, or the.

John Rogers: Rule in Shelley's case, yes!

John Rogers: So we have an instrument purporting to convey a life estate in B and a fee simple absolute interest in the following remainder of B's life in B's heirs.

John Rogers: Those two estates will merge together, Formulating… what?

Mireya Gonzalez: Is it fees…

Leanna Badar: Well, absolutely.

Jude Seleck: Executor interest in fee simple.

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: So this life here… transposed to an FSA, so I believe it was Alice that was initially correct.

John Rogers: Now…

doven: We combine, BB&B airs.

John Rogers: Yes?

John Rogers: Combine it into one interest.

John Rogers: So we apply the rule against perpetuities. So what is the rule against perpetuities gonna do? So basically, at this stage, we're at this, okay? From right here, we're just basically at…

John Rogers: it… the… it reads…

John Rogers: Oh…

Jude Seleck: So, wrap is void.

John Rogers: Oh, sorry. Just to be very clear, bees… executor… interest in FSA is void.

John Rogers: And since that is void, The conveyance just reads this.

John Rogers: So are we done?

John Rogers: What's OHAB?

John Rogers: Remember, it reads just like this.

Mireya Gonzalez: The F-S-S-E-L?

John Rogers: What?

gevorg kulikyan: Go ahead as well.

John Rogers: There's no longer an executor interest.

John Rogers: So, A's interest transposes from a fee-simple subject to executory limitation into what?

John Rogers: It's literally this. So what does A have? Just tell me what A has right here.

John Rogers: Oh, no!

Fatima Razavi: It is a feast and Lord.

Karen Hernandez: the term one?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Oh, absolutely.

John Rogers: pyramidable.

John Rogers: Be simple, determinable.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So then, since A has a fee simple determinable, what does O have?

Karen Hernandez: Possibility of reverter?

John Rogers: Alright, we are done. Was that… was that a hard one? Was this a hard one?

John Rogers: Is this hard?

John Rogers: Oh, gotta take a break. I've tested that at least twice. Exactly. So, we'll take a break.

John Rogers: Rest your eyes.

John Rogers: If someone wants me to make the final exam one sentence, could probably do that.

John Rogers: Take a break.

John Rogers: Enjoy your break. 15 minutes.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I should send you another email, Professor, with my essay.

John Rogers: Yeah, resend it. Just resend it.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Now I noted, I should just never do it first, just do it last, every time.

John Rogers: Someone's really scared with that last example.

John Rogers: Don't get scared.

John Rogers: Get tough, you got it.

John Rogers: So what I was planning to do now was go… Into the casebook.

John Rogers: I believe there are only 3 cases.

John Rogers: Two of which… I only assign them, I never go over them.

John Rogers: And they are… G… Symphony case, those are regarding the Bulligan's perpetuities.

John Rogers: There is Folsom.

John Rogers: And I'm kind of debating whether to even go over that, too.

John Rogers: I don't know what that means.

John Rogers: be mean. Explain, explain what that means.

John Rogers: I'm not asking where she physically is.

John Rogers: Don't worry about it. I'll find out myself.

John Rogers: But… I was just kind of thinking before class, it's very… the Folsom case…

John Rogers: I just don't know if it'll be a waste of your time.

John Rogers: Obviously, you're having trouble grasping this material, so you're going over a case.

John Rogers: be complicated.

John Rogers: So I'm inclined to just not go over it.

John Rogers: But… You won't be Kim.

John Rogers: This chapter begins Future Interest on 321. By the way, we hit rock bottom. This wasn't that, right? Wasn't as bad as I tried to sensationalize it, right? Was it really that bad?

doven: I thought I had it, and then my hair just went,

doven: But I'll… I gotta grasp it.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Thank you.

John Rogers: So we're on 321, page 321.

John Rogers: If we go to page 322, and by the way.

John Rogers: I always think the notes and property are really important. A lot of my notes that I gave you are from the casebook, but I can't include everything.

John Rogers: So, it's always worth it to always read the case notes in this class.

John Rogers: But… I wouldn't actually say the same is true for, like, evidence.

John Rogers: So, I would say the two… Classes.

John Rogers: that I think the notes are very important.

John Rogers: It's constitutional law and real property.

John Rogers: If we loan 322, interest retained by the transfer ore, which is O.

John Rogers: Grantor, transfer, or, reversion, possibility, reverter, right of entry, also known as power of termination.

John Rogers: And interest created in a transferee, otherwise known as a grantee.

John Rogers: Vested remainder, there are 3 types. Contingent remainder, and executor interest.

John Rogers: There you go.

John Rogers: The reversion.

John Rogers: Hmm, okay, okay.

John Rogers: Remainders on 327.

John Rogers: Lot of examples in your book.

John Rogers: Hmm, interesting. I'm wondering if I gave you contrary information.

John Rogers: So if we look at question 4… no.

John Rogers: Right under Example 4 on page 327, In Example 5.

John Rogers: I hope I didn't give you contrary information, but if we go to example 5,

John Rogers: O conveys 2A for life, then 2A's children and their heirs. That's a class gift, so it's subject to open. The more children that A have, has.

John Rogers: The more of the pizza they get.

John Rogers: The more interest they'll get.

John Rogers: A has one child who's B, so B is vested.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: What page? 328?

John Rogers: the remainder is vested and be subject to open to let later-born mistakes, sorry, children.

John Rogers: B's exact share cannot be known until A dies, that's correct.

John Rogers: So the class closes upon A's death, because

John Rogers: If A dies, A can't have any more children.

John Rogers: Which means the class, then.

John Rogers: closes.

John Rogers: If A has no children at the time of the conveyance, the remainder is contingent because no taker is ascertained. So if A does not have any children.

John Rogers: They are contingent remainders.

John Rogers: Because they are not born.

John Rogers: Yeah, I don't really care about… Folsom too much.

John Rogers: Fashion, destructibility.

John Rogers: 334…

John Rogers: destructibility of contingent remainders. A common law, contingent remainded if they did not vest upon termination of the preceding life estate, whereas vested remainers were not destructible in this manner. We shall consider the modern law on this

John Rogers: On this later in the chapter.

John Rogers: Otherwise known as.

John Rogers: iPhone law.

John Rogers: Executory interests on 334

John Rogers: If it's taking it from a grantor slash transferer, that's springing. If it's taking it from a grantee, that's shifting.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Where's contingent remainders?

John Rogers: Lot of examples in your books, guys. In your book.

John Rogers: Lots.

John Rogers: Page 340 goes into… to feasible fees?

John Rogers: They must have taken out…

John Rogers: Destructibility of contingent remainders, then.

John Rogers: Did I miss that?

John Rogers: Oh, it's, on 328th, they took out one of the examples.

doven: You said 320A?

John Rogers: 328, 328.

John Rogers: Okay. I… I think they took out all… alternative contingent remainders.

John Rogers: Yeah, they took it out.

John Rogers: Let's talk about an alternative contingent remainder.

John Rogers: For 40 seconds.

John Rogers: My former counterpart, Michelle Tobankin.

John Rogers: she still haunts all social medias, and if you ever find her, follow her, say what's up to her. She's super sweet, she'd love it. Oh man, she would love it.

John Rogers: She loved alternative contingent remainders, but think of it kind of like this. O2A for life, then 2B if C gets…

John Rogers: an A+.

John Rogers: the real property.

John Rogers: So notice this.

John Rogers: It's owed to A for life, which is a present possessory interest, then to B.

John Rogers: But notice B is not subject to the condition.

John Rogers: It's actually C. So if C gets the A+, B gets it.

John Rogers: So, it's alternatively contingent upon C fulfilling this condition in order for B to take.

John Rogers: alternative.

John Rogers: Alternate, alternative, contingent remainder. Also, subject to the rule against perpetuities.

doven: So that's subject to wrap. Is it void or voided, or we make a decision if it's valid or void?

John Rogers: Under that scenario, it would be valid, because it will vest or fail to vest within B's life.

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: Fast forward to, there are some review problems on 341. In the interest of time, I'm not going to be going over them, because it says the answers of these problems appear on Appendix B, beginning on page 1177, so if the answers are there, I think you all are

John Rogers: Beautiful, capable adults to do this on your own.

John Rogers: But if you really need someone to hold your hand.

John Rogers: You can give me a call at any time.

John Rogers: And I'd be happy to go over them with you.

John Rogers: Hmm.

John Rogers: I don't care very much about trusts.

John Rogers: Just trust me, okay?

John Rogers: 351 goes into destructibility of contingent remainders.

John Rogers: So that occurs… when…

John Rogers: the contingent remainder in a grantee is not vested at the time the prior estate holder dies. So what happens? I don't know, maybe it just kind of floats around in nowhere.

John Rogers: I don't know. No, it's gotta go somewhere. It must always go somewhere, okay?

John Rogers: Now, the common law rule is, it destructs. It's gone. Goodbye!

John Rogers: Rule in Shelly's case. There you go.

John Rogers: It provides, and this is on 353,

John Rogers: One instrument creates a life estate in A and purports to create a remainder in persons described in A's heirs.

John Rogers: or A's, or heirs of A's body.

John Rogers: and the life estate, and remember, are both legal and both equitable. I don't really care about that.

John Rogers: No, the remainder becomes a remainder in fee. Simple. We just… did that.

John Rogers: In that one example.

John Rogers: O to A so long as black acre used for residential purposes, otherwise 2B for life, then 2B's heirs.

John Rogers: Now, 354.

John Rogers: The rule in Shelly's case has been abolished, and an overwhelming majority of…

John Rogers: of states. It is still effective only in very small number of states.

John Rogers: So it's only applicable in minority and common law, not majority.

John Rogers: But, I still like to test on it, so what I've told my class, and I'm telling you, and I've told all the other classes of people that have unfortunately taken me.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: If it's an iPhone or common-law fact pattern, and you see it, mention it anyways as if it's the majority view. Just go with it.

John Rogers: Just go with it, okay?

doven: Majority of viewing Shelly.

John Rogers: Whoa… It's only applicable in minority and common law.

John Rogers: But if it comes up on an essay, and it's iPhone, and it's, like, iPhone times, Still talk about.

John Rogers: Still apply it.

John Rogers: Just go with it.

doven: They're already in climate law, but… One sec.

doven: iPhone.

doven: Still talk about it.

John Rogers: Yeah.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: Doctrine of Worthier title?

John Rogers: That is when… An instrument… conveys…

John Rogers: An interest in life to a grantee?

John Rogers: And then the remainder in the grantor's heirs, those heirs.

John Rogers: In essence, just weeds that out, and just says, O to A for life.

John Rogers: Similarly, At the very bottom of 354,

John Rogers: As with the rule in Shelley's case, however, seen in states that have abolished the worthier title doctrine, is

John Rogers: It is still a good idea to be familiar with it because of the possibility of

John Rogers: It hasn't been… oh, here we go.

John Rogers: It has been abolished in California, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Texas.

John Rogers: In a number of other states.

John Rogers: California, Massachusetts, Illinois' fine. New York, everything else, who cares?

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: Who cares? South Dakota abolished it? Oh, that's terrible! Oh, there's more people in Long Beach, California than there are in the great state!

John Rogers: of South Dakota.

John Rogers: They get two senators, and we get two senators.

John Rogers: The rule against perpetuities begins on 355. -Oh, oh, no!

John Rogers: Oh, no!

John Rogers: Oh, this is awful!

John Rogers: Look at all these examples. Example 30, example 29, example 28.

John Rogers: so many… I love examples.

John Rogers: You know, I give my evidence class an overwhelming amount of examples.

John Rogers: Because I'm an example… I like examples.

John Rogers: I don't think you could ever get enough examples. I don't think I give you enough examples.

John Rogers: But there's a lot of examples in this book.

John Rogers: Because in the evidence book, there are not a lot of examples. And many of you don't care, because you're not in evidence, which is fine.

John Rogers: 362, Wrap is applied to class gifts, so think vested remainder subject to open. That's considered a class gift.

John Rogers: Now, In… on 363, in some class gift situations, a rule of construction known as Rule of Convenience

John Rogers: may save the interest. Under the rule of convenience, a class will close as soon as one member of the class is entitled to immediate possession or enjoyment, even if this means closing the class before it closes naturally, or…

John Rogers: Physiologically, that is, when the possibility of birth or adoptions ends.

John Rogers: Interesting.

John Rogers: But I don't believe this book goes into The all-or-nothing rule.

John Rogers: And if you do spot it, because I'm… to be honest, I'm not too…

John Rogers: Familiar.

John Rogers: with the 10th edition, as I am the 9th.

John Rogers: Because it's all the same.

John Rogers: So I haven't seen if this edition…

John Rogers: cites the all-or-nothing rule. Let me know…

John Rogers: Come across it. I will give you bonus points.

John Rogers: That have no significance.

John Rogers: To your final grade.

John Rogers: All these examples.

John Rogers: Executory interest following defusible fees and options.

John Rogers: There are… Situations that I don't think it's necessary that we cover. One is power of termination.

John Rogers: I think y'all are gonna learn that wills, trusts, and estates, where someone is offered property with the power to terminate it.

John Rogers: Or the right to first refusal.

John Rogers: I don't care about.

John Rogers: How about that? No way! Look on page 365. Note number 26.

John Rogers: Currently, there are more than 150 living descendants of John D. Rockefeller.

John Rogers: The descendants are worth billions.

John Rogers: And guess what? One of them was my high school girlfriend. One of my high school girlfriends.

doven: green.

John Rogers: What's that?

John Rogers: Someone say something?

doven: Issa Roosevelt.

John Rogers: Rockefeller.

doven: Recovery?

John Rogers: You know how much her dad used to give her a week, what her weekly allowance was when I was, like.

John Rogers: A sophomore, junior.

John Rogers: Father used to give her a weekly allowance, and never… Never.

John Rogers: Oh my gosh.

John Rogers: 16, 17 years old, she'd have a new car every month.

John Rogers: Every month.

John Rogers: Every month, you get a new car.

John Rogers: Her dad used to give her, like, \$50,000 a week.

John Rogers: I was like, that's it?

John Rogers: But, you know what? She was really cool, really nice, not… Very, very, very cool person.

John Rogers: Just had a ton She lived literally on a rock.

John Rogers: Like, an island, it was a rock with a bridge going to the rock, and there's this huge house.

John Rogers: Absolutely insane.

John Rogers: That's another girlfriend that got away.

John Rogers: The wait-and-see approach… is on page 374.

John Rogers: That's actually part of a case.

John Rogers: But it discusses the wait-and-see approach, which I think I told you the wait-and-see doctrine, if I'm not mistaken.

John Rogers: Oh, note number 1 on 376 does go over options to purchase and right to refusal under the wrap. I don't get into that, but, you could…

John Rogers: Interesting. Wait a sec, I didn't know this. Hold on. If you look on 377 at the bottom, last paragraph.

John Rogers: Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities, U.S. RAP, or US RAP,

John Rogers: abolishes the application of the rule against perpetuities to options and other commercial transactions. I didn't know that.

John Rogers: I didn't… I had no idea.

John Rogers: I did not know that, I just learned that for the first time with you guys.

John Rogers: But since I don't really teach it, I don't think it's significant, but it's just something that I will…

John Rogers: Lodge and keep in my brain.

John Rogers: 381 discusses the uniform statutory rule against perpetuities.

John Rogers: On 382, The last paragraph… You read it.

John Rogers: You'll say, under… U.S. Wrap.

John Rogers: We first apply the common law rule.

John Rogers: to the interest in question. If the interest is good under the common law rule, great! Exclamation point! You see that great exclamation point?

John Rogers: There's nothing else to do. However, if the interest fails, we wait and see, conceivably.

John Rogers: But highly unlikely for 90 years to see

John Rogers: Whether the interest vests or fails to vest within that time.

John Rogers: The wait and see says 90, I told you 21.

John Rogers: that's different among jurisdictions. The wait and see 90 is a hard rule.

John Rogers: But sometimes states have their different,

John Rogers: Time, as far as the wait and see.

John Rogers: Under this, the wait and see was kind of absorbed by U.S. wrap.

John Rogers: Anywho.

John Rogers: If you care to read more about it on note number 1 on 390, go to the Current Status of the Rule Against Perpetuities.

John Rogers: And that's all I really have to say about this chapter.

John Rogers: Any questions?

doven: No, I just thought that Roosevelt thing was really, she's so lucky.

John Rogers: What?

doven: the Roosevelt, descendants, she's so lucky.

John Rogers: Roosevelt?

doven: I mean, I'm sorry, Rockefeller.

John Rogers: My ex-girlfriend?

doven: Yeah, she's…

John Rogers: I wanted her to do a… I wanted her… I wanted to get adopted!

John Rogers: I'm still trying to get adopted.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Yessenia Soria: Is she an attorney also?

John Rogers: No, I don't know what… her name was Lindsay, I don't know what happened to her.

John Rogers: I could find out, but…

John Rogers: She's not an attorney. I… this was in high school.

John Rogers: But then… Then, after her, I dated a girl that would make her look like a welfare check.

John Rogers: Literally, like, literally, like, I transitioned to, like, the richest man in Newport Beach's daughter.

Yessenia Soria: She got away also.

John Rogers: What's that?

Yessenia Soria: She got away also?

John Rogers: I think if I really tried to this day, I could probably get her back.

John Rogers: Because she still texts me.

John Rogers: Wow!

Isabella Salahshoor: the goal.

John Rogers: still does, even though she has a boyfriend. But I don't get involved in that, so… don't…

Yessenia Soria: Too many crazy people out there.

John Rogers: I probably shouldn't be saying this. Forget I said that. Forget I said that. Forget I said that.

Yessenia Soria: Forgot it.

John Rogers: We're gone, deleted.

maddykoshkaryan: Don't worry, they're not gonna post it anyways.

John Rogers: Never know.

John Rogers: But she was cool. Cool girl. Very sweet.

John Rogers: No Chanel, no Louis Vuitton, she still, to this day, still drives a 1975 Volkswagen bus. Doesn't really wear makeup.

John Rogers: when I dated her, she wore the same sweatshirt that I bought her at CVS for, like, 3 months. She never washed it.

John Rogers: Yet.

John Rogers: Her dad was worth billions.

John Rogers: Billions.

Yessenia Soria: So she's, like, a Natam Sandler.

John Rogers: A what?

Yessenia Soria: He's like the actor Adam Sandler. He has a lot of money, but he looks like he's broke, like a homeless person.

John Rogers: Yeah, kind of. Like, her dad drove an Expedition, and her mom drove a Volvo.

John Rogers: I wish.

maddykoshkaryan: You like that.

John Rogers: Why? She was just cool. Just a cool girl, just got along with everyone, bubbly,

John Rogers: I don't know, I think it's because, like.

John Rogers: Her dad was broke. Her dad was a homeless guy.

John Rogers: Living in a van when she was born, and then 7 years later, he's a multi-billionaire.

doven: Wow.

John Rogers: They kind of grew up, like, their early, like.

John Rogers: of her life as, like, kind of homeless. Her parents were hippie-type people.

doven: teams.

John Rogers: So, I don't know, maybe it's kind of that, but she's just super cool, very nice.

John Rogers: Questions?

doven: We have your lecture paper.

doven: You did the type.

doven: I think you do?

John Rogers: Oh, my notes? Yeah, I can,

John Rogers: I'll put them, like, I might not be done putting notes together, but when I'm done, I'll drop them in the chat.

doven: Okay. Also, you gonna give us an email for the 12… the Saturday…

doven: The link, the Saturday evidence.

John Rogers: Email me for that.

doven: Oh, okay!

John Rogers: Unless you guys just want me… oh, you know what? I'll just email it to you guys. So, I'm gonna send it to my evidence class, and I'll just copy this class.

John Rogers: Sorry.

John Rogers: But it's predominantly for evidence. But if you want to catch me, Go ahead.

John Rogers: If you want to call me on Saturday night at 9.45 at night, I'll answer.

John Rogers: I'll talk to you if you want.

John Rogers: So whatever, doesn't matter.

John Rogers: Questions?

Yessenia Soria: I'm gonna make a list of all my questions, and I'm gonna call you on Saturday night.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Alright.

doven: I may call you next week, dude.

John Rogers: Give me a call, I'd love to hear from you.

John Rogers: Just melt my heart.

Yessenia Soria: So, Professor, what week are we supposed to be on right now? Is it week 11?

Yessenia Soria: Because the recordings are up to week 8 only.

John Rogers: I don't know.

Deanna Khachatrian: This is weird.

John Rogers: I think we are on… I think it is week 8 right now, right?

Deanna Khachatrian: I think it's 9, if I'm not wrong.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: This is the 9th course.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: Plus, not course.

John Rogers: Why did I put my PowerPoint slides for my evidence last night as… last night as week 8?

Yessenia Soria: I don't know, because with Marjana, I know where I head, because she's doing 2 weeks and 1 week.

Yessenia Soria: But… I don't know, okay, I don't… I guess we're on week 8?

John Rogers: I think we're on week 8.

maddykoshkaryan: Hold on, Marginan is reviewing 3 weeks, I think.

maddykoshkaryan: 3 or…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I think we're in week 9, because even your link for tonight's Zoom says.

Karen Hernandez: Yeah, today's weekend.

John Rogers: How could I be wrong?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You're maybe one week behind.

John Rogers: No, but my… Okay, fine.

John Rogers: I will argue with you later. You know, I will… I will win, because I'm the best.

John Rogers: Anyways, are there any…

Yessenia Soria: We're technically on week 9, right? For all classes?

John Rogers: I don't know! I don't know, but I want to…

Yessenia Soria: I mean, if you're recording it, it's week 9, because we're going based on, you know, the Zoom, because I know she's ahead, because she wants to be ahead, finish quick, that's why.

John Rogers: You guys wanna talk about torts?

John Rogers: We don't bring torts to this class. Definitely not.

John Rogers: We don't bring SIB Pro, we don't bring community property, and everything else is okay.

John Rogers: No contracts in this class.

John Rogers: Take a shotgun to the head of contracts. Don't bring it in here.

John Rogers: Questions about property before I move on to the next chapter.

John Rogers: Very well.

John Rogers: Now we're… Going back up again. It's not too bad.

John Rogers: But we're not quite out of present and future interests… exactly.

John Rogers: We are now moving into co-ownerships.

John Rogers: I don't care about marital interests, because marital interest… we're gonna skip 100 pages. You will learn about that in community property when you take ZAND?

John Rogers: I don't know who's teaching community property.

John Rogers: I think it's Ann.

John Rogers: When you get to community property. And I love that, because then I don't have to teach it.

John Rogers: But we are going to learn about co-ownership, co-tenancies.

John Rogers: And that is when there is two, or more people.

John Rogers: that have an interest in the land. Now, it's applied to

John Rogers: Grandma's china, baseball cards, chattels, but I just like real property because the class here is real property.

John Rogers: But… It's 2 or more people.

John Rogers: So this discussion is triggered, for example, when you see Oak conveys Blackacre, 2A and B.

John Rogers: So long after.

John Rogers: Now you got 2 people involved.

John Rogers: Sometimes, 4 people involved.

John Rogers: And it's your job to determine what type of co-tenancy These individuals have.

John Rogers: You first determine what type of code tendency it is.

John Rogers: Then… Did it transform, change, or was it potentially severed?

John Rogers: And can one adversely possess the other?

John Rogers: And does anyone… does someone owe money or reimbursement to the other co-tenant?

John Rogers: So, there are 3 types of co-tenancies that we're gonna learn. It's tenants in common.

John Rogers: Joint.

John Rogers: tenants… and tenants by the entirety.

John Rogers: Three types?

John Rogers: Out of all of those, joint tenants is tested A lot.

John Rogers: by default.

John Rogers: to attendance in common as well. And then, don't see too often tenancy by the entirety, but it can come up, it's fair game to be tested.

John Rogers: I don't know where my notes begin with this.

John Rogers: But, I would like to start…

John Rogers: with joint… Tenancy.

John Rogers: And I'm going to teach this a bit differently.

John Rogers: on… different… on how I have taught it for the past 12 years.

John Rogers: Because I want to give you the correct law, and before I would… Kind of make my class

John Rogers: do a certain way, but I'm gonna change it a little bit this time.

John Rogers: A joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Occurs when there are two or more people.

John Rogers: And they each… Have an interest in the property.

John Rogers: Now… The last remaining survivor

John Rogers: Gets it in fee-simple, absolute, free, and clear 100%.

John Rogers: To whoever lives the longest.

John Rogers: And litigation.

John Rogers: Has been HUGE in this area.

John Rogers: It may be taken out of your book, but there were two idiots that were playing on train tracks one day.

John Rogers: And, they got mauled by a train.

John Rogers: Weird, huh?

John Rogers: Anyways, a witness… saw.

John Rogers: One of the individuals Blood squirting out of their neck.

John Rogers: And these two, they're brothers, I believe.

John Rogers: Held a piece of land.

John Rogers: In joint tenancy together.

John Rogers: And the issue was, who was the last remaining survivor?

John Rogers: Well, I got mauled by a train at the same time.

John Rogers: Well… In order for blood to squirt, Squirt out.

John Rogers: Your heart has to still be beating.

John Rogers: So they determined.

John Rogers: From what we can see, the last survivor was the person shooting blood from their neck.

John Rogers: Which means that person's heirs succeed to 100% ownership interest in the property.

John Rogers: So, if you…

John Rogers: Have a piece of land, let's say it's a home, a nice house somewhere, where's the house?

Fatima Razavi: CDM.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: It really helps.

John Rogers: Yeah, in Corona Del Mar, okay.

John Rogers: Alright. There's a very nice home in Corona Del Mar.

John Rogers: And, you… Have an interest in this home with your brother and your sister.

John Rogers: If you can outlive them, You succeed to 100% ownership interest.

John Rogers: But if you have it in joint tenancy, you have a separate, undivided.

John Rogers: 33.333% interest, so you have a third.

John Rogers: So you have every motivation to murder your siblings.

John Rogers: Hey, if they're killed, guess who the police are looking at?

John Rogers: So, yes, you have motive for murder, okay?

John Rogers: I tried to throw some criminal law, but… Whatever.

John Rogers: So… If you survive the longest, You get 100% ownership interest.

John Rogers: But while everyone's alive, You have a separate interest, but it's undivided.

John Rogers: So, you don't say, like.

John Rogers: Like, you get that third of the toilet, and I get this third. So when you go pee, you have to, like, pee on that side of the toilet, because that side is actually mine. It's not like that, it's undivided, okay? So you all have an interest in the toilet, okay? But it's undivided.

John Rogers: So, for example, if the toilet in this house was sold, you'd divide… you'd,

John Rogers: you'd get a third share of it. If the house ever sold, you would get a third share of it.

John Rogers: But it doesn't necessarily mean, like, chattels in the home. You have a draw line.

John Rogers: You get this side, I got this side.

John Rogers: Okay, it's not like that.

John Rogers: It's just a 33% undivided interest. Now, let's supposing you own this Corona Del Mar home.

John Rogers: Or you have motive to be very healthy, that is correct.

John Rogers: But the easier it is to kill. So, I mean, you know, whatever you want to do.

John Rogers: So, let's suppose you do have this Corona Del Mar home with your brother and your sister, and let's supposing your brother dies.

John Rogers: Supposing…

John Rogers: unfortunately, he kills himself. Let's say he shot him in the cell… he shot himself in the head twice, okay? So it was suicide. So then you own, then.

John Rogers: 50% of the CDM home with you and your sister.

John Rogers: So once a sibling then dies, their interest then goes to the living.

John Rogers: interest holders. So your 33.3% interest became 50. So you have it 50-50 with your sister.

Alice Orozco: I have a question.

John Rogers: Is your question how someone commits suicide by shooting themselves in the head twice today?

John Rogers: Paying attention? I… I worry no one gets that, but go ahead.

Alice Orozco: What if the sibling that died had, like, a living trust leaving that interest to his kids?

Alice Orozco: Would that affect…

John Rogers: Is nothing more Then squiggly lines on a piece of paper.

John Rogers: And I'm glad you mentioned that.

John Rogers: I've tested this twice.

John Rogers: We're a joint tenancy holder.

John Rogers: One will leave their interest to, like, C.

John Rogers: And the whole class will say, oh, she has an interest! But if it's held in joint tenancy.

John Rogers: You have no interest at death.

John Rogers: If you don't survive the longest!

John Rogers: So, even though you have this will that says things, That's just ink.

John Rogers: No legal significance.

doven: So, if one of the joint tenants leaves something to somebody outside that house, They can't get anything.

doven: If they die, it goes to the other two, joint tenants.

John Rogers: What I'm saying is this, if it's an interest in Black Acre, let's say, in this Corona Del Mar home.

John Rogers: If they are not the last remaining survivor, then they have no interest

John Rogers: To convey in your will.

John Rogers: did.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: How is a joint tenancy created?

John Rogers: Under the common law, It required the four unities. Time, title, interest, and Possession.

Yessenia Soria: Can you repeat that, Professor, please?

John Rogers: It's in my nose!

John Rogers: Time, title, Interest, and possession. It's also in the book.

John Rogers: Everywhere.

Yessenia Soria: Thank you, Professor.

John Rogers: Yeah, it's on… it's on 396, the next page, so if you go to Chapter 6 on page 395, you just turn one page, it's right there. There's your rules.

John Rogers: So, to create it under the common law, It's the four unities.

John Rogers: Which means that each recipient, grantee, Took at the same time.

John Rogers: Which means they're interests vested at the same time.

John Rogers: same interest, or title. They must take title through the same instrument. Meaning, I can't

John Rogers: convey a deed to A, and convey a deed to B,

John Rogers: and say, hey, you guys are joint tenants. No, they must be named in that same instrument, that deed, or will, or something, okay?

John Rogers: Now, do they have the same interest? Does A have a life estate, and does B have a fee simple determinable? If it's different, it's not the same.

John Rogers: There's no joint tenancy created. And possession.

John Rogers: Each has an equal right of enjoyment and possession.

John Rogers: If one of the four Unities is not present.

John Rogers: Then you can't create a joint tenancy under the common law.

John Rogers: What happens?

John Rogers: if… someone owns a piece of land. So let's suppose I have a Corona Del Mar home.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Which is actually just Newport Beach. There's no mayor of Corona Del Mar.

John Rogers: It's just Newport Beach.

John Rogers: Anyways…

John Rogers: So let's suppose I already own the property.

John Rogers: And I want to create a joint tenancy with me and…

John Rogers: My girlfriend, okay?

John Rogers: Sweetheart, I love you to death, you know, I'm… I feel really confident about…

John Rogers: Just putting my property in joint tenancy with you.

John Rogers: Common law.

John Rogers: Does not allow me to just execute a deed and just add her.

John Rogers: to the deed.

John Rogers: To create the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Under the common law, if I already have the property.

John Rogers: I would have to use a straw person.

John Rogers: My notes might say straw man, but I don't like that, because… could be a woman.

John Rogers: So a strong woman, strong man.

John Rogers: Or a straw them.

John Rogers: Anyways… It's often an attorney.

John Rogers: And what I would do is, is I would take my house, Blackacre, and I would convey it to the straw person in fee simple absolute.

John Rogers: The straw person would then re-convey it.

John Rogers: Back to me and my girlfriend.

John Rogers: So that all the four unities are satisfied.

John Rogers: We took from the same instrument, our interests vested at the same time. We have equal rights of enjoyment and possession.

John Rogers: Because if I already own the property.

John Rogers: I can't just add my girlfriend to the property, because our interests didn't vest at the same time. We didn't take from the same instrument at the same time.

John Rogers: So, it requires a third person to re-convey it back to us.

John Rogers: Under the common law.

John Rogers: You must discuss time, title, interest, and possession. You have to. I would always advise, if it comes up within a common law essay, to separate them.

John Rogers: Don't just put it all into one big, jolly… paragraph.

John Rogers: However, Modernly.

John Rogers: Modernly, Only requires specific language from the grantor.

John Rogers: Of the intentions to create a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: they're… Is specific language to use, but it gets a bit complicated.

John Rogers: And sometimes you have to measure what did the grantor intend to convey.

John Rogers: So… the… Way to look at it is…

John Rogers: Joint tenants with a right of survivorship will convey a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: That includes the survivorship language, right of survivorship, the right of the last remaining survivor

John Rogers: to succeed to 100% ownership interest of Black Acre.

John Rogers: So, it requires specific.

John Rogers: language.

John Rogers: that the grantor intended to create a joint tenancy. Things can get kind of weird.

John Rogers: Because sometimes the grantor could say, jointly.

John Rogers: O to A and B jointly.

John Rogers: That was on the bar.

John Rogers: when I get into the notes, I will get into specifics.

John Rogers: I should have started, shoot, I should have started with Tenants in common.

John Rogers: to sever a joint tenancy. So if you and me, us, We have Blackacre together.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: You have an interest, I have an interest. You have 50, I have 50. If you die, I get 100% interest. If I die, you get 100% interest.

John Rogers: But what happens if I just want to sell?

John Rogers: my interest.

John Rogers: I don't like you.

John Rogers: I don't want to be around you. I don't even be associated with you.

John Rogers: I want to sell this house. I want to sell my interest in the house.

John Rogers: If I do that, There is no requirement

John Rogers: This is talking about severance now. Severance of the joint tenancy.

John Rogers: There is no requirement that I notify you in advance.

John Rogers: That I tell you what I'm doing.

John Rogers: I don't have any… Requirement to ever talk to you.

John Rogers: So, yeah.

John Rogers: I sell.

John Rogers: My interest… to… Dean Frickberg.

John Rogers: And you don't even know about it.

John Rogers: Our joint tenancy is then… severed.

John Rogers: And you… will then be… Tenants in common.

John Rogers: with Dean Frickburn.

John Rogers: What's tennis in common? We'll get there.

John Rogers: For note-taking purposes, that severs it.

John Rogers: And then Frick Berg, and you are… Tenants in common.

doven: Well, joint tenants and survivorship, so if one decided to sell their interest to someone outside that So,

doven: Outside that house, and then it becomes tenants in common.

John Rogers: Yes, whoever the grantee is, the recipient of whoever you sell to, then becomes tenants in common.

John Rogers: with the original tenant, whoever that is. But remember, there's no requirement to notify the other co-tenant in advance.

John Rogers: I have quite a number of exam questions I've given out.

John Rogers: That says, unbeknownst to see, or without telling C, D, sold her interest to E.

John Rogers: And, oh my… God, I get law review articles about people that want… D?

John Rogers: killed.

John Rogers: Oh my god, this is terrible! Oh, jeez, I can't do that! Oh, no, the sky is falling! Doesn't matter. There's no requirement to tell, you can do whatever you want with it.

Alice Orozco: Is this for Common Law and Modernly?

John Rogers: Both.

Alice Orozco: Both.

Alice Orozco: It's kind of crazy. It's wild.

John Rogers: Oh, right, well, I'm glad that real property

John Rogers: life on the edge. Man, it is kind of sexy.

John Rogers: I'll admit, real property is… man, it's kind of like contracts.

John Rogers: No one laughed at that, which means that you guys are tired.

John Rogers: And it's 9.15, so I think I'm obligated to… Parole you.

doven: Oh, can we get that paper?

John Rogers: You can get the paper, but I don't actually have the physical paper, I have it.

doven: essay.

John Rogers: digital format. So what I'll do is, I'll save it right now, and I'll drop it in the chat right now. I'll email you guys, if you want to go on Saturday. You don't have to. If you don't like me, don't care. If you just want to ask me property questions, go right ahead.

John Rogers: Let me find it.

doven: Oh, you're fun.

John Rogers: Oh, really? Yes. I mean, I'm the best. So, yeah.

John Rogers: I'm the best.

John Rogers: Is it 10-2? 10-3?

John Rogers: tend to.

John Rogers: Okay, stand by.

John Rogers: Hold on.

John Rogers: Okay, I'm dropping it in the chat.

John Rogers: Now…

John Rogers: Can't hear you.

daniel Saghian: Good, you did.

daniel Saghian: Thank you, Professor.

Naira Hakobyan: Professor, I joined late as well.

John Rogers: I gotcha.

Naira Hakobyan: Thank you. Have a good night.

John Rogers: Ms. Gonzalez, those glasses of yours, you look like a judge in downtown LA, criminal judge. Actually, the supervising judge of the entire Los Angeles Superior Court Criminal Division wears glasses just like that, but the

John Rogers: like, the… Frames are thicker.

Mireya Gonzalez: Oh, I'm glad, speak that into existence, please.

John Rogers: So what are the questions, guys?

Amir Akbari: I have a question for the joint tenant. It should be exactly the same percentage, or between each of those

Amir Akbari: Individuals, or, it could be different percentage.

John Rogers: Oh my god.

Amir Akbari: Sorry?

John Rogers: Say that again, I'm not sure.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, I'm asking if they can have a different percentage, like, if there are, like, 3 persons on a one property, it should be 33% equal, or there could be different percentage for each individual.

John Rogers: Excellent question. Excellent question.

John Rogers: I will get into that next week, but right now, just thanking people.

John Rogers: I don't know if I want to go beyond that, because then it gets a little bit more complicated.

Amir Akbari: Okay, and my… thank you. My second question, for the tenant in common, they can sell, but in the joint tenant, they can't?

John Rogers: Yes, I can.

Amir Akbari: They can.

John Rogers: Yeah?

Amir Akbari: Okay.

John Rogers: It severs. It will sever the joint tenancy.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, you can do the… Severals of them, right?

John Rogers: We'll… we'll get to tenants in common,

John Rogers: It's different, but just remember, you can always sell your interest.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, without notifying.

John Rogers: It's just, what are the repercussions of that? What… how does that change the co-tenancy?

Amir Akbari: Oat.

Amir Akbari: Got it. Thank you.

Amir Akbari: canceled.

John Rogers: And you're okay with evidence?

Amir Akbari: No, no.

John Rogers: Yeah, I know, last night was a… it was tough. Last night, I got stumped.

Amir Akbari: And also, today, here, I lost you.

John Rogers: What?

Amir Akbari: I lost on the real property, too, tonight.

John Rogers: Oh, you're lost tonight?

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: Yeah, it gets tough.

John Rogers: Hello.

Amir Akbari: I will figure it out.

Amir Akbari: At least real property, I could.

John Rogers: You'll be fine. It'll start… things will get better for you in the coming weeks.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, but the important part is the… the last… like, 3 weeks?

John Rogers: Yeah, that's go time.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, yeah.

Amir Akbari: Off.

John Rogers: Well, yeah, it's go time, but, you know, you always have that take-home final.

John Rogers: Any questions?

Fatima Razavi: Professor, back to Amir's question. So, if they do want to sever under a joint, do they need to discuss it with each other? How do they go about doing that? I might have missed that in your lecture.

John Rogers: You were out to lunch when I was saying that.

Fatima Razavi: Sorry, can you reiterate that then, please?

John Rogers: You don't have to tell another joint tenant what you are doing in advance.

John Rogers: There's no requirement. You don't ever have to talk to them.

John Rogers: Send them a letter.

Fatima Razavi: I thought that was only in tenants in common, so it's the same thing for joint as well?

John Rogers: We're just talking about joint tenants. I just said, you can… it severs into tenants in common.

John Rogers: But there's no requirement you ever have to notify a code tenant.

John Rogers: With the exception of tenants by the entirety.

John Rogers: But you don't have to… Do whatever you want.

Fatima Razavi: Got it. Thank you.

Sarah Downs: Well, I guess I'm gonna go next, if no one else has anything to say. Thank you, Professor, for letting me sit in your class. I had a question all the way up from defeasible estate, determinable, and conditioned subsequent.

Sarah Downs: It'll be quick, I promise you.

Sarah Downs: Yeah, so… these conveyances happen… During an estate.

Sarah Downs: Not more so before, like,

Sarah Downs: Well, I guess let's focus there, because it can get a little tricky. So I guess, can you quickly go over determinable estate and conditions subsequent, please?

John Rogers: the difference?

Sarah Downs: Yes.

John Rogers: First off, When you're looking at a feat, There's 3 types.

John Rogers: There's fee simple absolute, Fetale, and defusible fee.

John Rogers: Three types.

John Rogers: Now, defusible fee, there are 3 types of defusible fees, as you said.

John Rogers: Be simple, determinable.

John Rogers: Fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and fee simple subject to executive limitation.

John Rogers: These two, be simple, determinable, And fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: If it's a future… if it's a present interest, present interest,

John Rogers: The material difference in identifying what the difference is between them is the language used.

John Rogers: So, a fee simple determinable will contain… Generally, Words of duration.

John Rogers: So you see so long as, as long as, while, until…

John Rogers: And that is interpreted to mean that I'm conveying something to you until the time comes when you don't use it for a certain purpose.

Sarah Downs: Right.

John Rogers: not longer.

John Rogers: And when someone conveys, a grantor, O, conveys a fee-simple determinable.

John Rogers: A fee-simple Determinable carries with it an automatic forfeiture.

John Rogers: which automatically reverts back to O, which would be a possibility of reverter.

Sarah Downs: Right.

John Rogers: So to determine a fee-simple determinable, you look for words of duration.

John Rogers: Conversely, a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, you want to look for on condition that provided that words that don't contain duration.

John Rogers: And what really gives it a hint, too, is the remedy that O reserves in him or herself.

John Rogers: And that is the right to re-enter and terminate.

John Rogers: So if you look at a fee simple determinable and a condition subsequent, the length… it could be almost identical, with the exception of certain words.

Sarah Downs: Right.

John Rogers: Differences is what are the repercussions upon a breach.

John Rogers: And a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: is not automatically forfeited upon breach, but O has the power to terminate it at any time.

Sarah Downs: Because of the right of entry.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: Right of entry.

Sarah Downs: So, for determinable estate, I know the punctuation,

Sarah Downs: Part matters, but the language has more importance than the punctuation position, right?

John Rogers: You said for a determinable, you said?

Sarah Downs: Yeah, because it has to come before the comma or the punctuation, right?

John Rogers: That's really good.

John Rogers: Give me any… what are you… what are you talking about?

John Rogers: My mistake, you know, Professor Anthony… No, no, no, you're not wrong. I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just…

John Rogers: I never really taught that to my class, so I want to kind of know what you're saying.

Sarah Downs: Okay, I understand. I guess, so basically…

Sarah Downs: The limitation of words, if it's before the punctuation mark, it's a determinable estate.

Sarah Downs: And then for condition subsequent, if it's after the punctuation, it's condition subsequent.

John Rogers: I… See, that's exactly true.

Sarah Downs: Right, so I guess in what I was saying, so when it comes to the words of limitation, the until, so long as, and then the provided that, that weighs more than the placement of the punctuation. I guess the punctuation is an additional thing that can help us

Sarah Downs: See if that's a determinable or a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: I would say the words of direct… the verbiage used is… controlling.

Sarah Downs: Okay.

Sarah Downs: Okay.

John Rogers: Yusufarian?

Sarah Downs: Yeah.

John Rogers: double check with him. I'm a little bit more broad, I think, and he's far more detailed, so definitely just double-check with him. And we're not taking the same final.

Sarah Downs: No, I understand. It's just… it's a good review to talk about it.

John Rogers: Yeah!

Sarah Downs: Okay, let me let the rest of everybody else talk.

John Rogers: No one else is gonna talk.

John Rogers: Anyone want to say anything?

Sennett Devermont: I was just listening, you know, but this is a lot, and…

Sennett Devermont: I'm now going back to the beginning to strengthen that stuff, because it's a lot on top of a lot, so…

John Rogers: A lot of stuff, right?
