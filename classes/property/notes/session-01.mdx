## I. Acquisition by Discovery

### **Johnson v. M'Intosh** (1823)

**Issue:** Who has valid title to land when competing claims exist - one from Native Americans and one from federal land grant?

**Facts:**
- Plaintiff Johnson inherited land purchased directly from Native Americans
- Defendant claimed ownership through a federal land grant from the U.S. Government
- Both parties claimed valid legal title

**Historical Context:**
- Native Americans discovered America first
- European settlers (Puritans) came to America seeking religious freedom and to practice conservative Christian values
- The Puritan value system became foundational to early American law and culture

**Holding/Rationale:**
- Native Americans were not practicing Christians
- Because they did not believe in or practice Christianity (the foundational value of the nation), they could not own land
- **Native Americans could only occupy land, not own it**
- Therefore, any purported sale of land by Native Americans was ineffective - they never owned it in the first place
- The federal land grant prevailed

**Note:** This case is primarily a history lesson and is **not tested**. It provides introduction to property concepts.

## II. Acquisition by Capture

### **Pierson v. Post**

**Rule:** **Acquisition by capture requires either:**
1. **Mortally wounding** the animal, OR
2. **Trapping/capturing** the animal

**Facts:**
- Two hunters (Post and Pierson) were hunting a fox on public land
- Post was pursuing the fox with hounds
- Pierson intercepted and killed the fox instead
- Question: Who has rights to the fox?

**Analysis:**
- Mere pursuit of wild animal does not create property interest
- Problems with pursuit theory:
  - How do you know the fox is running because of one specific hunter?
  - Multiple hunters could be pursuing same animal
  - Bears or other animals could also be chasing the fox

**Holding:** The hunter who **mortally wounds** or **captures** the fox has the vested property interest.

**Important Limitations:**
- Hunters must be on **public land** (not trespassers)
- Cannot apply trespass and capture rules to private property
- Law is **imprecise** - there will be gray areas and factually distinguishable circumstances

**Key Takeaway:** If the law was precise, we wouldn't need lawyers. The law is inherently imprecise.

### **Ghen v. Rich** (1881)

**Facts:**
- A whaler killed a fin-back whale using a bomb lance (specialized weapon with identification markings)
- The whale sank and washed ashore days later
- A finder discovered the whale and sold it to Rich
- Rich sold the whale for oil
- Ghen sued to recover value of whale, claiming ownership based on the identifying harpoon

**Rule:** Under **local custom** and **public policy**, the fisherman who harpooned the whale has the property interest.

**Rationale - Local Custom:**
- In this whaling community, harpoons had distinguishing marks identifying which company/individual inflicted them
- The area offered a **finder's fee** to incentivize return of harpooned whales
- This economy depended on whaling

**Rationale - Public Policy:**
- If finders on beach got 100% interest, the whaling trade would die
- Nobody would engage in whaling if there was significant risk the whale would end up on someone else's beach
- Logistical difficulty: Retrieving every whale immediately would:
  - Be physically difficult
  - Interfere with ability to capture more whales
- Whales often sink after being harpooned - fishermen cannot always immediately retrieve them

**Distinguishing Factor:** This case relied heavily on **local custom** and **public policy considerations**, making it distinguishable from Pierson v. Post.

### **Popov v. Hayashi** (Barry Bonds Baseball Case)

**Facts:**
- Barry Bonds hit his 73rd home run baseball into the stands
- Popov initially caught the ball in his glove
- Popov was tackled by crowd, causing him to lose control
- Hayashi picked up the ball after it was dislodged
- Ball valued at over $1 million initially (sold for $450,000)

**Legal Claim:** Popov sued Hayashi for **conversion** (tort - civil wrong involving wrongful exercise of dominion over another's property)

**Arguments:**
- **Popov's claim:** Had **prepossessory interest** - took significant but incomplete steps to possess the abandoned ball, but for interference of others
- **Hayashi's claim:** Had full control by picking up the ball and did nothing wrong

**Holding:** Court could not determine who should get the ball - both had legitimate but incomplete claims.

**Resolution:** Court ordered the ball be **sold and proceeds split** between both parties.
- Each received $225,000
- Note: Popov's lawyer fees allegedly consumed his share; Hayashi's lawyer worked for less/free

**Key Concept:** **Prepossessory interest** - an interest that arises when someone takes significant steps toward possession before being wrongfully interfered with.

## III. Acquisition by Find - Lost, Mislaid, and Abandoned Property

**This is TESTED material - usually appears as a "throw-in" issue worth approximately 10 points on final exam.**

### Three Categories of Found Property:

#### 1. **LOST PROPERTY**
**Definition:** Property where the owner **did NOT intend** to place the item where it was found.

**Characteristics:**
- Typically found on the ground (suggests it fell/was dropped)
- Owner did not intentionally place it in that location

**Example:** Checkbook found on the floor of a grocery store

---

#### 2. **MISLAID PROPERTY**
**Definition:** Property where the owner **DID intend** to place the item in that location.

**Characteristics:**
- Intentionally placed somewhere
- Owner forgot to retrieve it

**Examples:**
- iPhone sitting on a desk in a classroom (resting on surface = intentional placement)
- Checkbook on checkout counter at grocery store
- Lottery ticket taped to closet wall
- Treasure chest buried in sand at beach

---

#### 3. **ABANDONED PROPERTY**
**Definition:** Property where the owner has **relinquished all interest** in the item.

**Characteristics:**
- Owner gave up rights to the property
- Often found near trash cans or disposal areas
- Context suggests intentional abandonment

**Example:** Painting resting near a garbage can in a park

---

### Critical Analysis Factors:

**When characterizing found property, examine:**

1. **State of the property when found:**
   - Where was it located?
   - How was it positioned?
   - What does the physical state suggest about intent?

2. **Location - Public vs. Private Land:**
   - **Public land:** Finder may have rights
   - **Private land:** Generally goes to **landowner/occupier**
   - **Rationale:** Owner of lost/mislaid property likely to return to location where lost
   - Makes sense to give to landowner who can return it

3. **Trespasser Rule:**
   - Law does NOT reward trespassers
   - Cannot trespass on private property, find something, and claim ownership
   - Example: Cannot enter someone's home, take items, and claim you "found" them

---

### Exception to Landowner Rule:
**There is an exception when the landowner has never been to their own property** (case to be covered in Week 2)

---

### Exam Approach:

**Most Important:** Focus on **articulating the characterization** of the property (lost, mislaid, or abandoned).

**There is often NO single right answer** - the key is thorough analysis:
- You can argue any of the three categories
- What matters is how well you articulate your reasoning
- Use facts about the **state of the property** to support your conclusion
- Avoid "what if" scenarios - analyze based on what you find at the time

**Example - Money in Brown Bag in Bathroom:**
- Could be lost (fell out accidentally)
- Could be mislaid (intentionally placed while using restroom)
- Could be abandoned (deliberately left behind)
- **Any answer can earn full credit with proper articulation**

---

### Historical Note: **Treasure Trove**

**Treasure trove** is a **common law concept** from medieval Europe:
- If you found treasure, it belonged to the King or Queen
- This concept is **NOT followed today** in the United States
- Modern law defaults to lost, mislaid, or abandoned analysis

**Note:** You will NEVER need to write "treasure trove" on a final exam. It is included only for historical context.

## Key Exam Tips:

1. **First few weeks seem easy** - material gets progressively harder around Thanksgiving
2. **Lost/mislaid/abandoned is a "throw-in" issue** - usually Question 3 or 4, worth ~10 points
3. **Focus on characterization** - the meat of the analysis is properly categorizing the property
4. **Articulation is key** - there's often no single right answer; demonstrate your reasoning
5. **Avoid trespasser scenarios** - remember property rights depend on whether finder had legal right to be there

---

**Materials for Next Week:** Continue with subsequent possession (gift and adverse possession)
