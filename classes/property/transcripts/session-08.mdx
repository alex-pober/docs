# Property - Session 08

## Transcript

Mauricio Canas: I started it.

Maddy Kosh (2): If it's her birthday at the end of the day, so…

John Rogers: Thanks.

John Rogers: I'll meet you host, bye. Thanks.

John Rogers: Alright, sorry about that. When I, log in, it says, waiting for host to start the meeting, so I can't log in, so I have to usually contact the school, so I do apologize, but…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): No worries.

Fatima Razavi: Itsenia's, gonna be running late.

Fatima Razavi: 5 minutes.

John Rogers: Does anybody know where Professor Dolmagian's class is?

John Rogers: Don't you have any friends that, or taking her.

Clarissa Terrazas: No, Professor, but I heard she's behind schedule, since she was out 2 weeks.

John Rogers: I just want to know where they are in comparison to us.

Clarissa Terrazas: I believe they're behind. Just don't know where.

Fatima Razavi: I'm asking right now, I'll find out for you.

John Rogers: Because I heard today that they may have hit the rules against perpetuities, and if that's the case,

John Rogers: They're going real quick, then.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: Any questions from last week? Because what I was planning to do tonight was kind of go over vested remainders again. We'll get into contingent remainders, we'll get into executor interests.

John Rogers: What I typically do then is, go into the casebook.

John Rogers: and then go back and learn about destructibility of contingent remainders, rule in Shelley's case, doctrine of whether your title, and the rule against perpetuities. But I kind of want to ask you guys

John Rogers: do you want to cover and finish everything tonight, and then go over the casebook next week? At least just finish lecture on everything?

Jude Seleck: Sounds better.

Karen Hernandez: Yes.

Alice Orozco: Yes, please.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, that sounds great.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: We can do that, but,

John Rogers: That would mean that we will hit rock bottom tonight.

John Rogers: so… You're not going to be… Leaving class tonight.

John Rogers: Happy.

John Rogers: But we'll finish it, and we can,

John Rogers: Cover any questions you have next week.

John Rogers: And we'll go over the cases, we'll go over the casebook, we'll go over more examples. And you might, after tonight, be able to do

John Rogers: some, some of the essays?

John Rogers: But, I think when we hit the next chapter, co-tenancies, you'll be able to officially do 50%.

John Rogers: Okay? And after which, Class is smooth sailing, because then we go into landlord-tenant, and that's usually

John Rogers: not hard, it's very practical, it's easier to conceptualize, so you'll be good.

John Rogers: But before I begin, do you guys have any questions from last week? And I know there's questions because I got a lot of phone calls in the past 7 days, so I know that there are questions.

doven: I have a question. So, shifling, executive interests, and springing, can you explain the difference?

John Rogers: I don't think I covered it last week, I think I ended with vested Remainers, is that correct? I don't think I lectured on it, did I?

Fatima Razavi: Slightly.

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: Because I, I would… typically teach that after contingent remainders, and I don't remember going over contingent remainders.

John Rogers: Right?

Karen Hernandez: Oh, okay.

Fatima Razavi: You did contingent remainders as well.

Fatima Razavi: You brought up shifting under vested remainder subject to complete our total divide… divestment.

John Rogers: But that's vested remainers.

Fatima Razavi: So you said, owe to A for life, then B unless C gets an A-plus in real property, and if so, then to C, and then you said C is a shifting executory interest, taking whatever B would have.

Fatima Razavi: If C gets an A+, then C has an indefeasible vested remainder, and B divests all its interests.

John Rogers: Just don't remember it, but… I guess I'll just…

John Rogers: for… for my personal benefit, I'll… I'll re-go over everything.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, I have a question. Vested remainder subject to partial divestment or subject to open? Do you want us to write both of it, or do we have to differentiate between partial divestment and subject to open?

John Rogers: It's the same thing.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, because you wrote OR. Alright, thank you.

John Rogers: Kind of like saying, There's no air versus… there's no oxygen.

John Rogers: Kind of, in a way.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Fatima Razavi: Oh, they're covering remainders.

John Rogers: Really? Okay, so they're going quick.

John Rogers: They're going super quick, because if they skip two classes, and they're where… then they are where we are at.

John Rogers: they're going fast. I… I, I, I…

John Rogers: maybe I've been going slow. I don't know.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I think we're pretty good.

Karen Hernandez: Oh, we're good.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Yessenia Soria: Yes, I have a question, Professor. On the essays, the practice essays, have you had time to finish?

Yessenia Soria: Reviewing them?

John Rogers: I've got through 3 today.

John Rogers: But I'll get to you. I'll get to you, though.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: I did notice, today.

John Rogers: I did notice today.

John Rogers: Okay, and I do see a reoccurring pattern.

John Rogers: That…

John Rogers: I told you guys, be very careful with adverse possession, okay? Because it seems very easy. It's gonna be on your final.

John Rogers: Adverse possession will be on your final. It has never not been tested on a final exam in the 12 years that I've been teaching this class, okay?

John Rogers: So, it's very important that you get it, and you don't…

John Rogers: underestimate it, because actual occupancy for the S I sent you

John Rogers: I see a lot of you not fully explaining yourself, and you're gonna get whacked.

John Rogers: Because it aligns with one of the cases we read in class.

John Rogers: So, if you don't kind of see that, That's how you're gonna get…

John Rogers: whacked. I hate to say whacked, but yeah, you'll get whacked.

John Rogers: So… just… When we shifted from post-COVID, and it's now this…

John Rogers: 24-hour final exam that's just so hard. I had to think of a different way to teach and test.

John Rogers: So, I wouldn't be expecting certain things

John Rogers: as I do today, pre-COVID, when students only had an hour to do an essay.

John Rogers: But since you have a lot of time, it's kind of easier for me to relate cases to some of the final exams, because it's a way for me to

John Rogers: Spot the examinees that, That see those things.

John Rogers: But when you get feedback, when I get back to you, I'll write that case, okay?

John Rogers: There's probably a few cases that you can, that you can… site.

John Rogers: Now, citing cases for a final exam is optional. You'll never have to cite a case, okay? Never have to. We'll never hold that against you, but sometimes the rationale

John Rogers: Is from a case.

John Rogers: So…

doven: kids.

John Rogers: If you want to know more, feel free to call me, you can call me tonight, you can call me Saturday morning, Sunday night, we can go over it, I can explain more to you, okay?

John Rogers: Before we begin… Is there any other questions?

doven: Oh, Professor, you mentioned something… It came to mind also.

Agnes Gholoonian: Oh, go ahead.

doven: Oh, I sent yours, so I'll wait.

doven: So I wish you a great month.

Agnes Gholoonian: I… you mentioned something about sending essays that were, like, handwritten and far more superior than anyone could do. I was wondering, you know, if you can email us

Agnes Gholoonian: to us?

John Rogers: Okay, well, just to clarify, okay, that some of the best answers I've ever received were actually people that hand-wrote a final exam.

John Rogers: unbelievable to me. I don't have those.

John Rogers: But I did send you guys,

John Rogers: I believe on Friday, a link to my Dropbox, so you can download prior student final exam answers, what real-life human being students wrote. Now, they're pre-COVID, so they did it in one hour.

John Rogers: But you can kind of see how they wrote the format, how they're approaching things. I don't remember what essays will go with what questions, because I sent you guys close to 30 essay questions, but you guys can figure that out.

Agnes Gholoonian: Sorry, where can I find that link?

Agnes Gholoonian: Did I not send it to you guys?

Yessenia Soria: Yeah, you emailed it, but it expired after a certain time.

Agnes Gholoonian: I didn't even receive the email, to be honest. If I'm looking at the 3 emails that I've received from you, I don't have it in any of them.

John Rogers: You've only received 3 emails from me?

Agnes Gholoonian: Yeah.

Agnes Gholoonian: That's all I have.

Agnes Gholoonian: Or, did you send more emails?

John Rogers: I think.

Yessenia Soria: No, I think it's 3. It was the outline.

Yessenia Soria: And then, one saying you were going to come to class, not that you were going to be on campus or something like that.

Yessenia Soria: And then this email. That's what I've got so far.

Agnes Gholoonian: I have… I have… all my emails from you are from August.

John Rogers: Okay.

Yessenia Soria: Me too.

John Rogers: Give me one second, okay? Sorry. And I know I want to jump into the material in just a second, but hold on, okay?

Agnes Gholoonian: Oh, I think, Maria.

Yessenia Soria: I did get the email with the link, but it says right there on your email to go ahead and do it quickly, because it would expire, and it did expire when I seen it. I think it was yesterday.

Mireya Gonzalez: I could drop it in the chat, I have them downloaded.

Mireya Gonzalez: I think Scent just shared it, actually. Okay.

Agnes Gholoonian: Yep, got it. Thank you.

John Rogers: I would love it if you guys did it, because it saved me the work from having to resend everything.

John Rogers: But, they're good. Some of them… I think one of the students went… I remember her. A+, A+, F.

John Rogers: F on the multiple choice questions.

John Rogers: F, but A+.

John Rogers: A+. I don't think I've ever given an A+. I don't…

John Rogers: And that was in 2015, 2016.

John Rogers: Okay, so…

John Rogers: let's begin. Okay, so I'm gonna share my screen, and I'm gonna do the same thing we did last week. I'm just gonna go over the issues, I'll discuss them. I won't be able to see your

John Rogers: beautiful faces, so if you have a question, I'm not gonna know, I'll just maybe recognize your voice then, okay?

John Rogers: Now, I typically,

John Rogers: My outline that I sent you guys.

John Rogers: Has everything that you need.

John Rogers: to get an A-plus in this class, okay? It's everything that you need.

John Rogers: Now, the… my outline that I sent you, week one, from when we started this class.

John Rogers: Contains every rule that you will ever need to cite, okay?

John Rogers: But if I give you that.

John Rogers: Don't ask me, what's the rule for this?

John Rogers: It's right there, okay? And I… if you ask a question, and I snap at you, and I say, what's the rule? What's the rule? You can find it right there if you want.

John Rogers: But I'm gonna be stressing rule statements, because if you really understand them, this will make much more sense to you, because you'll know how it operates.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So here we go. Now… We started with O, presumably has a fee simple absolute, oops, goes Ugh.

John Rogers: to A.

John Rogers: to be.

John Rogers: Now, we learned last week there's gonna be C, D, E, F, G, more people. Remember, O

John Rogers: is the original grantor the architect. Nobody can change what O wants, okay? O is the architect to everything. Cannot be changed.

John Rogers: A, is the present possessory interest holder, present possessory interest, PPI, okay?

John Rogers: A will have, 96% of the time, a present possessory interest in a life estate.

John Rogers: Or it could be peratre V, or it could be a defeasible life.

John Rogers: A could have a fee, a fee simple absolute, a fee tail, a defusible fee. There are 3 types of defusible fees. There's fee simple determinable.

John Rogers: fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and a fee simple subject to executory limitation. That is A.

John Rogers: All last chapter dealt with A.

John Rogers: This chapter, we are learning the future interests that O has, and the future interests that B, C, and D have.

John Rogers: Okay? So we are done with A. A is done, okay?

John Rogers: Jeez.

John Rogers: So we're focused on O and B. Tonight, we are going to be focusing a lot on B and C and D.

John Rogers: Incidentally, We will learn what O has.

John Rogers: To a certain extent. We're not going to be covering right of entry, we're not going to be covering possibility of reverter, because we did discuss those extensively last class.

John Rogers: I'm focused more on the future interest in a third party, which is B.

John Rogers: Now.

John Rogers: B, will 97.8% of the time, have… One of these three things.

John Rogers: A remainder, okay?

John Rogers: Okay? And we learned that there are vested remainders? Ugh!

John Rogers: End?

John Rogers: Contingent remainders.

John Rogers: And then there's Executory interests.

John Rogers: interests, okay?

John Rogers: Now… Remember, a remainder Follows a light.

John Rogers: A remainder will never follow.

John Rogers: a fee.

John Rogers: Okay… So if you see B, Alright.

John Rogers: an A has a fee simple subject to executory limitation, it's never going to be a remainder.

John Rogers: If you look at the rule.

John Rogers: for a remainder. Doesn't matter what it is.

John Rogers: It will contain language that says the natural expiration

John Rogers: of the prior estate. Natural expiration is when someone's heart stops for good.

John Rogers: When they die.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Generally, no.

John Rogers: So, a remainder will always have to follow.

John Rogers: A, that has something in life.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: There are 3 types of vested remainders, okay? 3 types. Indefeasible In this… Feasible. Ugh.

John Rogers: vested remainder, or indefeasibly vested remainder. Now, you have all of this information in my outline that I sent you.

John Rogers: You have everything.

John Rogers: There's a vested remainder, subject to open, or you could say subject to partial divestment, okay?

John Rogers: And there's a, vested remainder Subject to… Complete.

John Rogers: Divestment.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Indefeasibly vested remainder is O2A for life, then to B. Very simple. We remember we're focused on B tonight, alright?

John Rogers: If someone's asking me questions, I can't see it. So…

John Rogers: Let's break this down, okay? Very simple. I just want ABCs. O presumably has a fee simple absolute, A has a present possessory interest, it's not future, it's present possessory interest in a life estate with A being the measuring life, right?

John Rogers: A will not have this forever.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor?

Agnes Gholoonian: I'm so sorry, I don't think you're sharing your screen.

Agnes Gholoonian: Or am I the only one that doesn't see it?

Clarissa Terrazas: I can't be your screen right now.

John Rogers: You are screen sharing.

Agnes Gholoonian: I can't see your screen.

Yessenia Soria: Yeah, we could… I could see it.

maddykoshkaryan: Log in and log back in.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: On the top, it should say meeting, and then John Rogers Screen.

Agnes Gholoonian: I'll figure it out.

John Rogers: No, because you know what? There might be other students that can't see my screen that don't want to say anything. So.

Agnes Gholoonian: I'll log out and log back in, maybe that's it, but I'm even going through all the members in the… in the chat, and I can't see…

John Rogers: I just stopped, so can you see me?

Agnes Gholoonian: I can see you, yeah.

John Rogers: Well, let's get my face out of here before I break your screen, so I'm gonna share it again.

John Rogers: Now I could see it.

Agnes Gholoonian: Perfect.

John Rogers: So, very simple, guys. A, we don't care about right now, because we learned it.

John Rogers: Now, once A dies, it must go somewhere, okay? It cannot be floating around in the air, it must go somewhere.

John Rogers: So, where's it going to go?

John Rogers: indefeasible vested remainder? Yes, so B has an indefeasible…

John Rogers: vested remainder. Why? How are you arriving to that? And I'll tell you.

John Rogers: B is not subject to any condition that B must fulfill Prior to taking.

John Rogers: B is gonna get it, no matter what. No one is going to take it from B. Doesn't matter.

John Rogers: And B will have it in B Simple Absolute.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: B is named. B is a person. B is named, so they are ascertainable.

John Rogers: Now, let me change this up a little bit, okay?

John Rogers: Let's say B has it for life!

John Rogers: What does B have now?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: In the feasible vested remainder, or life?

John Rogers: Beautiful. I absolutely love it. Beautiful. IQ of 1200.

John Rogers: B has an indefeasible vested remainder…

John Rogers: for life. Now, is B going to live forever?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: No.

Alice Orozco: No.

John Rogers: No! So when B dies, where does it go? Does it just kind of float around? Do we have to, like, find it? Like, look under the table? Where's it gonna go?

Aram Harutyunyan: Goes to… Perfect.

John Rogers: Packable version.

John Rogers: As a reversion. Beautiful, love this. You guys have 1300 IQs. The reason is this. B is not going to have this forever, so when B dies, it's going to go back to O. So O will retain a reversion.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Perfect.

John Rogers: Bested remainder subject to open. This is a class gift, okay? A class gift. This is going to be very relevant for the rule against perpetuities, which you all will learn tonight and not like.

John Rogers: It's a class gift.

John Rogers: Which means that more people can enter the class.

John Rogers: So let's go to the example that we talked about.

John Rogers: last week.

John Rogers: Let's supposing…

John Rogers: Grandma!

John Rogers: has a piece of property, where? Where's grandma's property? It's per… it's a great property. You love it. Where is it?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Malibu.

John Rogers: I mean, Malibu's cool, but, like, it's just kind of hard to get in and out from, but we can go with Malibu. So…

John Rogers: Grandma is leaving the property to the children of her daughter, so your mom.

John Rogers: K.

John Rogers: The children of your mother.

John Rogers: And you are a spoiled brat-only child!

John Rogers: So, what is your interest in the Malibu Mansion?

John Rogers: Like, how much of that Malibu mansion are you gonna get when Grandma dies?

Alice Orozco: The whole thing.

John Rogers: You're gonna get the whole thing, because you're a spoiled, single, spoiled kid, right?

John Rogers: Only child, right?

John Rogers: I don't know if people are laughing or they're taking me serious. Please, it's just a joke. But you get 100%, right?

Jude Seleck: Provided that there are no other kids born.

John Rogers: Okay, but right now, you get 100%!

Amir Akbari: Yes. It's subject to open, right?

John Rogers: Right now, you are getting 100%.

Amir Akbari: Yes.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: But!

John Rogers: your mother Can have more children, right?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yes.

Alice Orozco: Yes.

John Rogers: As long as your mother can have more children, which means that she's alive.

John Rogers: The more children she has, the less of the interest you will get in the Malibu mansion, right? So, if your mother has a child, and now you have a sibling, how much of that Malibu mansion are you getting, then?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: F…

Aram Harutyunyan: A smaller portion?

John Rogers: 50%.

John Rogers: And then if another kid comes, then you only got 33%.

John Rogers: And then, oh, mom makes a fourth mistake and has a fourth child! Now you only have 25%.

John Rogers: So, notice this.

John Rogers: You are getting it.

John Rogers: You're not subject to any condition. You don't have to do anything to get it, other than just Nothing.

John Rogers: You're named, you're one of the children in this class.

John Rogers: But your interest… is subject to being partially divested. Not completely, just partially.

John Rogers: When more kids enter the class.

John Rogers: So it's subject to open.

John Rogers: Partial divestment. Think of it like a pizza. We all love pizza. If you don't, you're a serial killer.

John Rogers: So… The more children, the more people that want the pizza, the less you get!

John Rogers: Once mom dies, the class closes. There's no longer any more children.

John Rogers: But as long as mom is alive, It's subject to open.

John Rogers: And that's where we're getting this, for example.

John Rogers: O?

John Rogers: 2A for life, then to B's children.

John Rogers: B has one… Let's say 2 children.

John Rogers: So, children, C and D.

John Rogers: It's not going… to be It's going to B's children.

John Rogers: Okay? So B has no interest, but B's children have the interest. So let's break it down. Presumably, O has a fee simple absolute.

John Rogers: A has what?

Karen Hernandez: present PPI.

John Rogers: In what?

Karen Hernandez: Life estate, with, B being the measuring line.

Aram Harutyunyan: A, being that.

Karen Hernandez: Hey, sorry, A.

John Rogers: Perfect. Okay? Perfect. Okay.

John Rogers: What is B's children have?

Alice Orozco: Invested remainder, subject to partial divestment.

John Rogers: Perfect. Love it.

John Rogers: A vested remainder Subject to partial divestment, okay? In fee or life.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Life.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, I have a question.

Fatima Razavi: No questions? Okay.

John Rogers: Hold on. Someone just said life. Does it say then to be children for their lives?

John Rogers: And it just says, then to be's children.

John Rogers: This is modern law, not common law.

John Rogers: Modern law.

Amir Akbari: be simple absolute.

John Rogers: Phi simple absolute, and phi simple absolute. If it ended with lights, Then… O would have a reversion.

John Rogers: Okay? So, vested remainders, subject to open, okay?

John Rogers: Means, if more people can enter the class.

John Rogers: The less of the interest the other class members get.

John Rogers: So it's like a pizza, right?

John Rogers: The more people that enter, the less pizza you get, which means the more meaner you become.

John Rogers: Got it?

Jude Seleck: Professor, are we going to assume it is modernly unnecess… You mentioned this common law?

John Rogers: I don't teach common law. I do?

John Rogers: We learned the very basics of common law, but as I said before, I like the type of law that existed when the iPhone came out.

Jude Seleck: Got it, thank you.

John Rogers: iPhone law, modern law. Now, some of the essays I've given you say assume a common law jurisdiction, which case, you just mark errors.

John Rogers: To represent the feet.

John Rogers: If this was.

Fatima Razavi: Wait, I'm so sorry, Professor. In your original thing, you said grandma's leaving the property to the children of the daughter, so wouldn't it be…

Fatima Razavi: O to A for life than to A's children?

Fatima Razavi: Where did B come from? I'm not understanding the state.

John Rogers: Oh, I mean, I wasn't representing that example to this.

Fatima Razavi: Oh, okay. Thank you.

John Rogers: So… It's partial divestment, so if B can have more children, the class is open.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: the moment… B dies.

John Rogers: What do you think happens to this class?

Karen Hernandez: It closes?

John Rogers: Closes.

John Rogers: So what… Will, if it closes, then it's no longer open.

Amir Akbari: The feasible vested reminder?

John Rogers: Correct, it would then transition to an indefeasible vested remainder.

John Rogers: Questions?

doven: Well, that wouldn't be for life, right?

John Rogers: If B is alive, B can have children.

John Rogers: I don't care how old B is, I don't care if she's 178 years old.

John Rogers: Class closes.

John Rogers: Vested remainder subject to complete divestment.

John Rogers: So this means that an individual, B,

John Rogers: B is in Barbara, or Bill.

John Rogers: Is subject to having their interests completely taken from them.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: completely taken from them. So, go… 2A for life, then 2B,

John Rogers: Unless Steve gets an A-plus in real property class.

John Rogers: Okay? Now, I… we did cover executory interests a little bit.

John Rogers: Because the executor interest would take it from B.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: Let's break it down.

John Rogers: O presumably has a fee simple absolute. The fact pattern will usually tell that to you.

John Rogers: A has what?

John Rogers: You guys know what A has? All you really have to do is just kind of read this. You can read this here if you want to. What does A have?

Aram Harutyunyan: Present possessory interest.

Aram Harutyunyan: In a life estate.

Aram Harutyunyan: Being the measuring life.

John Rogers: what does… Behalf.

John Rogers: I'd have to read this together.

Fatima Razavi: Vested remainder subject to total divestment.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: In fear life.

Aram Harutyunyan: Live?

Fatima Razavi: In life.

John Rogers: Where do you… why is it in life?

Fatima Razavi: Actually, I would say fee, because once A dies, it goes completely to… B?

John Rogers: Yeah, but it doesn't say to be for life, right? It just says to be. Modernly, that's a fee.

John Rogers: Or total. Total or complete, doesn't matter.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Now… Why? Here's the thing.

John Rogers: Forget this for now, okay? Forget this. Forget this.

John Rogers: Alright? Let's just… Put it in red. Forget that. I just want you to do this for right now.

John Rogers: B would have a vested remainder, because B doesn't have to do anything, right? B doesn't have to fulfill any conditions. B is a named individual. B is ascertainable, okay?

John Rogers: So… It's a remainder.

John Rogers: It's a vested remainder, right? If this red didn't exist here, then it would just be indefeasibly vested, right? No one could take it from B, right?

John Rogers: None of B's interests would get smaller and smaller because it's not a class gift. It's just a bee.

John Rogers: But you have to take this now and say, wait a second, Unless it's going to be… Unless…

John Rogers: C gets an A+.

John Rogers: So, wait a second.

John Rogers: It's going to UB.

John Rogers: But it is subject to being completely taken from you, if C does something.

John Rogers: So, B, you are getting it, but you are subject to it being completely taken

John Rogers: If something happens beyond your control.

John Rogers: Okay? So, B would have a vested remainder subject to total divestment.

John Rogers: Now, let's remove this red here.

John Rogers: And… for someone with a 1400 IQ, What does… C, as in…

Fatima Razavi: shifting executory… Interest?

Aram Harutyunyan: C as in Carlos.

John Rogers: Yeah, yeah, there we go, season Carlos, or Carlos.

Jude Seleck: contingent remainder.

John Rogers: C would have a shifting executiveatory

John Rogers: interest in the Simple Absolute, and…

John Rogers: Fee's interest is in fee simple absolute.

John Rogers: Executory interests, which are down here, what are you talking about? Yeah, I know, that's why I said 1400 IQ.

John Rogers: So, these are the very basic examples.

John Rogers: And I don't want to give you these convoluted, crazy examples, because I think in the long term, in one year from now, when you are long gone from this class and very happy about it, you're not going to remember certain things.

John Rogers: So just know the very basics of this.

John Rogers: Once you familiarize yourself with it.

John Rogers: Then you can start challenging yourself more.

John Rogers: But just start with baby steps first, okay?

doven: Did I ask the question?

John Rogers: Yeah.

doven: So, shifting and technical interest is just… C, could take it.

doven: you know, but he had to get an A+.

doven: So, it's like a question mark.

John Rogers: Yeah, I mean, C may never get an A+, which is fine.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Wouldn't need to say that? That then it would go to C?

John Rogers: Oh, I'm sorry, yeah. Unless C gets an A-plus in property, sorry, then to C.

John Rogers: My apologies. My apologies. I'm not perfect. I… I think I've told you guys repeat, I'm not perfect. I know it's hard to believe. I know it's hard to believe that I'm…

John Rogers: I know you guys think that I'm perfect and flawless, but I do make some mistakes.

John Rogers: Commit.

doven: I think I will never make.

doven: Okay, so then to see, it's a shifting executive interest.

John Rogers: Yes.

doven: Okay, but if you take dentistry out.

doven: Would it still be a shipping executive interest?

John Rogers: I think it would, because it really wouldn't make sense.

doven: Okay.

gevorg kulikyan: That's a question.

John Rogers: First off, I… look, you guys know that I'm kidding a lot of the time, right? I don't… I can't… I don't know if people are laughing or not, but I'm just trying to…

John Rogers: Trying to make property somewhat entertaining.

John Rogers: But I don't want to get emails from the dean saying.

John Rogers: The students are saying that you're too egotistical because you think you're so perfect.

John Rogers: Anyways, ask your question.

gevorg kulikyan: Yes, so in a vested remainder subject to open, does the class only close when

gevorg kulikyan: B dies, or can it also close when A dies?

John Rogers: Well, it says then to B's children. As long as B can have more kids, it's open. Doesn't matter when A dies.

gevorg kulikyan: So when A dies, do B's children not become present possessory interest holders?

John Rogers: Yes, they do. So it could still be divested. Yes. Okay. Now, if you really… Really wanna get deep.

John Rogers: The unborn children have an executory interest. That's real property threes.

gevorg kulikyan: Hmm.

John Rogers: So, let's go into contingent remainders, okay? Contingent remainders.

John Rogers: What is a contingent remainder? Can someone read me the rule that I gave you guys? And all you have to do is just read those squiggly lines left to right.

John Rogers: What's a contingent remainder?

John Rogers: Well, it's a remainder.

John Rogers: So, it's capable But not certain.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Let's just go over it very slowly.

John Rogers: to future interest.

John Rogers: it's capable But not certain.

John Rogers: Whereas a vested remainder is certain.

John Rogers: A contingent remainder is not certain.

John Rogers: It's just… capable.

John Rogers: of becoming possessory, So… I, as B, could get it. I could get this.

John Rogers: could…

John Rogers: upon the natural expiration of the prior estate, so O to A for life, so when A dies, I could potentially get it.

John Rogers: But… I'm subject… B is subject to 1,

John Rogers: A condition that must be fulfilled or two, I'm an unascertainable person.

John Rogers: Let's get an example.

John Rogers: O2a for life, Does this look familiar?

Aram Harutyunyan: Yes.

John Rogers: Yes, it should look familiar, come on!

John Rogers: O to A for life.

John Rogers: than to be.

John Rogers: If… B gets an A-plus in real property.

John Rogers: So… B is named, B is as ascertainable.

John Rogers: But what does B have to do in order to get Blackacre?

doven: Either A-plus on real property.

John Rogers: Yeah, gotta get that A+!

John Rogers: So… Is be capable.

John Rogers: of getting an A+.

Sennett Devermont: Possibly.

John Rogers: Yes, but it's not certain, right?

John Rogers: So notice how that comports with the rule for contingent remainders. That

John Rogers: B's interest. B will get this, but it's contingent.

John Rogers: upon B, getting that A+.

John Rogers: So it's not certain.

John Rogers: O presumably has a fee simple absolute. A has a present possessory interest in a life estate, with A being the measuring life.

John Rogers: B.

John Rogers: Has a contingent remainder in life, or fee simple absolute?

Aram Harutyunyan: Peace.

John Rogers: Be simple, absolute.

John Rogers: Now, this is where… You REALLY gotta think sometimes.

John Rogers: Because oftentimes, students miss this part on a final exam.

John Rogers: Is there a possibility that B could never get that B+, or A+?

John Rogers: A+?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yep.

Karen Hernandez: Yes.

John Rogers: So, if B doesn't get… the A-plus… Where's the property gonna go?

Aram Harutyunyan: No, we're having possibility of reversion.

John Rogers: There's no such thing as a possibility of reversion.

Aram Harutyunyan: Reverter, I mixed it up.

John Rogers: It's not a possibility of reverter, because a possibility of reverter is

John Rogers: reserved an O when O conveys what?

John Rogers: All you guys gotta do is just open up that table that I sent you week 1.

Fatima Razavi: A simple absolute.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Be simple determinant.

John Rogers: a fee simple determinable. So, O would only have a fee simple possibility reverter if a B-simple determinable was conveyed to A.

John Rogers: But it's not the case here.

John Rogers: So… Someone may have said the right answer. What does O have?

Karen Hernandez: free version.

John Rogers: a reversion, correct. Okay?

John Rogers: a reversion. So in the event that A dies.

John Rogers: and B hasn't received that A-plus in property, it will go back to O.

John Rogers: Or owes errors.

John Rogers: Give me another example.

John Rogers: O2A for life, Then to… then to the heirs of B.

John Rogers: B is alive!

John Rogers: Hi, D!

John Rogers: So, O presumably has a fee simple absolute. A… did we know what A has? I think this one's kind of complicated, because I don't know if you guys can fully…

John Rogers: fully know what A has. But for those of you that can figure this out, all you really have to do is just read this.

John Rogers: What do bees' heirs have?

gevorg kulikyan: Vested remainder subject to partial divestment?

John Rogers: Okay.

Karen Hernandez: Contingent remainder.

Fatima Razavi: Yeah, contingent remainder.

John Rogers: Why is it… first off, I want to know why you said vested remainder subject to open.

gevorg kulikyan: Because B can have more airs.

John Rogers: Well, what.

gevorg kulikyan: And there's no.

John Rogers: For a vested remainder.

doven: That's the remainder of certainty. Certainty?

John Rogers: certainty, okay?

John Rogers: But a vested remainder is not subject to any condition.

John Rogers: And the recipients, the grantees, are ascertainable.

Alice Orozco: Does anybody know who their heirs are? No.

Karen Hernandez: Until you die, right?

John Rogers: Heirs are determined at death.

John Rogers: You don't know who your heirs are. As much as you want to say, no, no, don't believe me, I know who my heirs are, you don't, okay? Your heirs…

John Rogers: Are determined when you die.

John Rogers: So, B's heir, since B is alive, thank God, right? Oh, jeez, so sad if B died.

John Rogers: Professor Dolmagian's class is on the rule against perpetuities right now.

John Rogers: Wow. They went fast. They went REAL fast.

doven: Well, we'll take our time.

John Rogers: Take our time. Okay. Okay, we can take it.

Yessenia Soria: We want to learn, we just don't want to go… Flying through it.

Fatima Razavi: She didn't go fast, she told… I was in her class, the two weeks that she was gone, she expected everyone to just read, and be caught up, so that she was on the same page as everyone else. So she's not going fast, she's on… on point.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Right.

Yessenia Soria: Those who are going in.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, quick question. If it didn't say air and it said children, then it would be the other one.

John Rogers: Yes, as long as there was one child alive. If B does not, for example, have any children.

John Rogers: then it's contingents.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, but if it did have children, then the vested remainder subject to partial divestment?

John Rogers: Correct? Yes. Okay.

Fatima Razavi: Thank you.

John Rogers: B's heirs have a contingent remainder.

John Rogers: And since, in fee simple absolute, and since the conveyance ends with a contingent remainder.

John Rogers: By operation of law, O will always retain a reversion, okay? Always. Anytime it ends with a contingent remainder.

John Rogers: O always retains a reversion.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, I keep giving you guys examples of present possessory interest in a life, but I could…

John Rogers: throw a… a difficult one and say O2A for the… life of B, then to… C…

John Rogers: if she gets in… A… plus… in property.

John Rogers: Okay, so for that instance, you'd have, presumably, O has a phi simple absolute, A has a,

John Rogers: A present possessory interest in a life estate per attribi.

John Rogers: for the life of B, with B being the measuring.

John Rogers: Does that make sense?

John Rogers: C would then have a contingent remainder in FSA, and O would then retain a reversion. Got it?

Fatima Razavi: Yes.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Basic, basic, basic examples of stuff, okay?

John Rogers: basic examples, okay? Are you… are you all ready to get into executory interests?

John Rogers: Hold on.

John Rogers: I want to see everyone's face to see where everyone's at.

John Rogers: How's everyone doing? Okay?

Aram Harutyunyan: Good.

doven: Okay, can I see that last one again? The paper again?

John Rogers: The last one?

doven: Oh my god.

John Rogers: I'll put it back up.

John Rogers: But, any,

John Rogers: Questions so far? So I can't see you guys, so I don't know if anyone is rubbing their head, or scratching their eyes, or what. I don't know, so I kind of want to see you.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: On your notes, you have alternative contingent remainder.

John Rogers: Okay, I don't typically teach alternative contingent remainder. It's in your book as one example somewhere, and I'll point it out, probably next class.

John Rogers: And…

John Rogers: it would be, like, O to A for life, then to B,

John Rogers: If…

John Rogers: C gets an A-plus in property. So it's like B will get it, but B is not subject to the condition. The condition is… if C gets the A+, then B will get it. So it's alternatively contingent on something else.

John Rogers: So it's not like B has the condition to get the A+, it's C has the condition, and if C gets the A+, then B will get it.

Yessenia Soria: Service.

Yessenia Soria: Oh, sorry, quiet.

Aram Harutyunyan: Go ahead.

Yessenia Soria: I was just gonna ask, thank you. I was just gonna ask, is this, like, the…

Yessenia Soria: The… one of the cases where the… Look, parents, volunteer.

Yessenia Soria: What?

John Rogers: Go ahead, go ahead.

Yessenia Soria: Is this, like… A condition is, like, one of the chapters that says,

Yessenia Soria: The children have to be 25.

Yessenia Soria: 25 years old after he dies. If not, they lose it.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: Sort of, yes, but we will learn that that's very problematic tonight.

Aram Harutyunyan: Professor, how complicated does this, get tested on the bar, or how confusing a fact… how deep does it go?

John Rogers: In the past 35 years, a future int… 30 years, the past 30 years, maybe? A future interest has not been tested on an essay.

John Rogers: It's only been present interest. Fee simple determinable, or condition subsequent. And restraint on alienation, the life of state.

John Rogers: no future interest until, I think, last year.

Aram Harutyunyan: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Executory interests.

John Rogers: Follow a life or fee?

John Rogers: Okay? And we've covered this, so think of it like O to A, so O conveys Blackacre to A, so long as…

John Rogers: Black Acre is used for residential purposes, otherwise to be.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: An executory interest is a future interest, okay? It's future. They don't have it right now, alright? They don't have it right now.

John Rogers: but it divests the prior estate. It takes it away from them.

John Rogers: It takes it from them.

John Rogers: So, A has this property right now.

John Rogers: But it's subject… But if… but A's interest, present interest, is subject to being totally divested.

John Rogers: if A breaches, which B takes.

John Rogers: So… O presumably has a fee simple absolute, A has a present possessory interest, and a fee

John Rogers: Simple subject to executive limitation.

John Rogers: And B would have what?

Amir Akbari: The simple absolute.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Executive her interest.

John Rogers: Executory interests.

John Rogers: In the Simple Absolute.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: So, let's go O… 2A, so long as Black Acre is used for residential purposes.

John Rogers: Otherwise, to be polite.

John Rogers: Presumably.

doven: Would this also be a restraint used for personal purposes?

John Rogers: It's a restraint on use, not sale. It's not… it's not restricting the sale.

John Rogers: Only the use of it.

John Rogers: A has a present necessary interest.

John Rogers: In what?

Karen Hernandez: And glyphosate.

John Rogers: A has A? A? A?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Be simple, absolute.

John Rogers: present possessory interest, and I mean, A has it, and fee simple, absolute A can do whatever A wants with it?

Amir Akbari: Pretty simple.

Aram Harutyunyan: Subject to a…

Amir Akbari: Secretary limitation.

John Rogers: B simple, subject to executory limitation, and then B would have what?

Karen Hernandez: Executory interests in life?

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: Good!

Aram Harutyunyan: He's a future interest holder, right? That's… or in other words.

John Rogers: Boom.

John Rogers: B's future, because B does not have the property right now, right? It's only if it breaches. Now.

John Rogers: B only has it, potentially, for B's life.

John Rogers: So once Bee dies, where's it gonna go? Does it… is it just gonna go to, like, the Wizard of Ozland? Like, where's it gonna go?

Karen Hernandez: Would it be reversion to owning?

John Rogers: Yes! Reversion O retains a reversion, so in the event that B gets it, B will only have it for the duration of B's life.

John Rogers: And when B dies, it has to go somewhere, so it's gonna go back to O, or O's errors.

John Rogers: Beautiful! Love it!

John Rogers: Love this.

John Rogers: O would change if B simple, absolute, and then what would A have?

Aram Harutyunyan: present, possessory interest in a… Fee, simple, subject to…

Aram Harutyunyan: Executory limitations?

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: And then what would B have?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Executory.

Amir Akbari: trick.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: And fees, absolute.

John Rogers: Correct.

John Rogers: Or Medal of Honor, whatever you want to use, whatever you like better.

John Rogers: O presumably has a fee simple absolute. What does A have?

doven: Present? -

Amir Akbari: Possessing interest in a few simple executor limitation?

John Rogers: For A?

Amir Akbari: 4A.

John Rogers: Executory? No.

Karen Hernandez: Would it be in Life is… Life Estate?

John Rogers: Yes!

Aram Harutyunyan: Well, being during life.

doven: Imagining life.

John Rogers: Boom, so what does B have?

Aram Harutyunyan: Is it contingent remainder?

John Rogers: B? What does B have to do?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Nothing.

John Rogers: Is B named? Do we know who B is? Is B a great guy or woman?

John Rogers: They're named.

John Rogers: Could you text B? Yeah, that means it's possible, so they are ascertainable.

John Rogers: So…

Amir Akbari: Contingent remainder?

John Rogers: Okay, so what… how is it contingent that B will get it?

Amir Akbari: For a life, for a natural expiration of the life of A.

John Rogers: okay, but what's contingent about B getting it? Because once A died…

Fatima Razavi: Running?

John Rogers: It's going to… B.

John Rogers: So what does B have to do? It's just once A dies, it goes to B.

gevorg kulikyan: Nothing.

doven: remainder?

Amir Akbari: differences.

John Rogers: Oh, no… There we go.

John Rogers: Sorry, ugh… I made a mistake, I'm so sorry. It says, then to be for life. Sorry. For life.

John Rogers: What does he have?

Karen Hernandez: Will it be the same thing?

John Rogers: Well, ask yourself this.

John Rogers: Is C named?

John Rogers: C's ascertainable, right?

Karen Hernandez: Yes.

John Rogers: Is C subject to any condition? Does C have to do anything?

Karen Hernandez: No.

John Rogers: So… it's either…

John Rogers: It's either vested, it's either a vested remainder, or it's an executory interest, because it's not a contingent remainder, because they're named, and they don't have to do anything.

John Rogers: So… What kind of vested remainder? I'll tell you that, I'll give you that. Is it a vested remainder?

Karen Hernandez: Indefeasible.

John Rogers: No.

Mireya Gonzalez: Subject to…

Clarissa Terrazas: complete.

Clarissa Terrazas: Complete.

Fatima Razavi: Subject to complete.

John Rogers: Oh… What does D have?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Executory interest.

John Rogers: In phi or Life?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: and fee.

John Rogers: Boom.

John Rogers: Boom.

John Rogers: So remember… D, the executor interest.

John Rogers: Is going to divest C.

John Rogers: take it from C's interest, if they get that gold medal.

John Rogers: Don't get confused. D is not going to have a contingent remainder, because notice the language says, then to C.

doven: Which isn't.

John Rogers: But if D, it doesn't say then to D if D gets, it says, but if D wins.

John Rogers: So, C will get it, unless D does this.

John Rogers: So you really have to look at the language, because the language is very telling.

John Rogers: If it says, then to D, if D,

John Rogers: then you've got a contingent remainder. So then to C for life, then to D, if D.

John Rogers: Okay.

doven: Well, if it said then to D, then it'd be contingent remainder for D.

John Rogers: But, but…

doven: So, executive interest takes away… would take away the,

doven: Because I was confused, because D, there's no guarantee that D will win an Olympic gold medal.

John Rogers: I mean…

John Rogers: there is no guarantee. The only guarantee that anyone would win a gold medal is if I tried, I'd get a gold medal, but I just feel bad for people, so I don't try. So anyways. But yes, there's no guarantee that Dee will ever get a gold medal.

John Rogers: And if that doesn't happen, then eventually C

John Rogers: We'll get it in phi simple absolute the moment D. Dots.

Amir Akbari: So, what happens if the bee is alive, and D could win the gold medal?

John Rogers: Okay. Then, Dee's interest?

John Rogers: Would then become a indefeasible vested remainder.

Amir Akbari: Okay, so we don't go to that C, because the condition is satisfied with the D, right?

John Rogers: And it would go just like this.

John Rogers: That'd be all canceled out.

John Rogers: So that would just be O, then to B for life, then to D.

Amir Akbari: Okay.

Amir Akbari: Oops.

doven: That is when D wins the gold medal.

John Rogers: Yes, if D gets that gold medal.

doven: But if Dean does it, then a C.

John Rogers: She's… she's sayonara. See ya, Charlie.

John Rogers: Now, for note-taking purposes, Executory interests, And… contingent remainders.

John Rogers: And class gifts, vested remainder subject to open, are subject to the rule against perpetuities.

John Rogers: Are subject to the rule against perpetuities.

Fatima Razavi: Can you please repeat those again?

John Rogers: It's in my notes, but,

John Rogers: Contingent remainders, executory interests, and class gifts slash vested remainders subject to open.

John Rogers: Are subject to the rule against perpetuities.

doven: The subject against the rules?

John Rogers: Yeah, we're gonna learn about it, and… After the break.

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: That rule is basically if you ever meet someone, ever, in any 50 states that has taken property, they will mention this rule to you.

John Rogers: Questions.

John Rogers: Because the future interests We have now just covered.

John Rogers: Done with future interests.

John Rogers: Done.

John Rogers: Done.

John Rogers: But I could get cute on a final exam, because I did this to my class a few years ago.

John Rogers: Oh my god! The sky is falling!

John Rogers: I think it was… like… Otherwise…

John Rogers: It was something like that.

John Rogers: Oh, no, what is that? Oh, no, we can't figure this out! Doesn't make any sense!

John Rogers: The sky is falling!

John Rogers: He has what? What do you guys think?

John Rogers: What does B have?

John Rogers: Do you think…

John Rogers: be haves.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Be simple, determinable?

John Rogers: Well… it's not a present possessory interest in a fee-simple determined, because B doesn't have it right now, right?

John Rogers: It's a future interest.

John Rogers: So what kind of future interest does B have?

Amir Akbari: A wasted… wasted remain… remainder, subject to complete.

John Rogers: Yeah!

John Rogers: Is it in phi or life?

Karen Hernandez: B.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: what… kind of fee.

Amir Akbari: Exactly, yeah.

Karen Hernandez: Yeah, exactly.

Amir Akbari: Disability Limitation.

John Rogers: Be simple, subject to executory limitation. Yes!

John Rogers: What does C have?

John Rogers: Remember… Gonna take it, divest B.

Jude Seleck: Secretary.

John Rogers: Huh?

Jude Seleck: Executory interest.

Alice Orozco: Pinterest?

John Rogers: In fear life.

Jude Seleck: P.

John Rogers: Boom.

John Rogers: That's not bad, right?

John Rogers: Is that any bad?

John Rogers: maybe I could make that your final, but I just tweak it a little bit.

Fatima Razavi: Great idea.

John Rogers: Miss Downs, how you doing? Welcome! What's going on?

Sarah Downs: Hello, hi, nothing much, just sitting in on your class.

John Rogers: Alright, what class are you coming from?

Sarah Downs: I don't know how to say his name, it's…

John Rogers: Period.

Sarah Downs: Yes.

John Rogers: Oh, okay. You guys are probably on a different area of the class right now, I would assume, right?

Sarah Downs: I mean, yeah, not too far. Maybe we're at the end of… Destruction of contingent remainder?

John Rogers: Oh, okay, we're gonna cover that tonight. Okay, perfect.

Sarah Downs: Yeah, so I'm like, we're the same… same part.

John Rogers: And you guys.

Sarah Downs: They just…

John Rogers: Oh, wow, okay.

Sarah Downs: What were you saying?

John Rogers: No, because I think he, Professor Severian starts with, landlord-tenant, and then wraps around, but I think you guys learn about adverse possession last, if I'm not mistaken.

Sarah Downs: Yeah, because we haven't learned about that yet. I mean, we know about it, but yeah, land or tenant…

Sarah Downs: And then now we're in the Edwards book, and then we're gonna go back to the Duke and Heimer book, so, I mean…

John Rogers: Alright. It's fine.

John Rogers: So the good news for tonight, everyone, is tonight is rock bottom, okay? Tonight is the rock bottom. It's gonna be the bottom of the rock, and then you start veering back up, okay?

John Rogers: Do you guys want to take a break right now for about 15 minutes and come back?

John Rogers: What do you guys…

doven: Can I see that?

Yessenia Soria: Can I see that paper again, just briefly.

John Rogers: Yeah, we'll take a break right now, how's that? So, I'll share my screen right now, so what do you need to see?

doven: I want to take a picture of it.

John Rogers: Oh, if you want, I can just save this and email it to everyone.

doven: Yeah, can you?

Yessenia Soria: Yeah.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Amazing.

John Rogers: I'll email it to everyone.

John Rogers: Just remind me before class, the end of class.

John Rogers: Alright, so I'll take a break. 15 minutes.

Yessenia Soria: Thank you.

doven: Thank you.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Professor?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Do you know when you're gonna get to most of the adverse possession essays turned into? Because I emailed you, I think, like, kind of texted you, but I never got a response.

John Rogers: You know what?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Maybe I was just being annoying, but…

John Rogers: We were, like, probably one of the first people to get it in, and I was like.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: One sec.

John Rogers: I should make you a priority, but yeah, I got it.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Alright, alright, cool, thanks.

doven: Professor, did you get mine?

John Rogers: I did.

John Rogers: I did, but you didn't do the adverse possession SN.

doven: No, I just did a little bit of… I started…

John Rogers: But I got another one, but I don't think you should do that one just yet. I think you should do the adverse possession, like, fully.

John Rogers: So it's been, what, Close to 17 minutes.

doven: Professor, do you mind if I send you our adverse possession this weekend?

John Rogers: Do I mind what?

doven: Do I see an adverse essay?

John Rogers: Send me… send me an adverse possession essay?

doven: Yeah. I'm gonna be mine.

doven: Okay, thanks.

John Rogers: So what we are going to get into is, we're totally done.

John Rogers: with future interests.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: So we've done present interest, and we've done future interests.

John Rogers: This part is now going into the validity.

John Rogers: of the interests.

John Rogers: The validity of the interest.

John Rogers: So, are there certain situations Where states will merge together.

John Rogers: Where it will merge and then transform into another estate, maybe from a life to a feat.

John Rogers: And then we will end the class.

John Rogers: Going into the rule against perpetuities, which everybody hates.

John Rogers: And that's officially rock bottom.

John Rogers: So get excited, okay?

John Rogers: Fund!

John Rogers: I mean, I usually… the past 12 years I've been teaching, I usually get laughs, but I don't feel like anybody laughs with me, so I feel like either one, maybe I'm not funny, or two, maybe I'm just a bad teacher? I don't know.

John Rogers: You guys are really quiet.

John Rogers: really quiet.

John Rogers: So I don't know if it means I should probably not joke around as much as I do.

doven: Professor, can you send us a copy of those, you're typing?

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: But I'm not finished on the typing, so I'll send the typing to you at the end of class.

doven: already.

John Rogers: Anyways… Enough about me.

John Rogers: See where the book is.

John Rogers: Feasible estates, future interest… So, it's going into rules furthering marketability by destroying contingent future interests.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: So… I think the first one is… Destructibility of contingent remainders.

John Rogers: Now, destructibility of contingent remainders, many of the concepts that we're gonna learn right now are

John Rogers: Common law only and far-reaching minority.

John Rogers: But destructibility of contingent remainders is a common law concept, okay? It's common law.

John Rogers: I believe there's maybe a couple of states that still Still…

John Rogers: use it, I'm not sure, but it's common law, for sure, okay?

John Rogers: So let's kind of apply the comma law to Modern example. Modern.

John Rogers: So, think of it like, O…

John Rogers: 2A for life. This looks familiar.

John Rogers: Then, to be…

John Rogers: I think this is in my notes, so we'll just go over it. If B gives A a proper funeral.

John Rogers: That's fine.

John Rogers: So, let's break down what everybody has. O has a fee simple absolute, presumably. A has a present beneficiary interest in a life estate, with A being the measuring life.

John Rogers: And then B has a contingent remainder, and then O would have a reversion, okay? Because it's possible, hey, O may never give A a proper funeral.

John Rogers: So, a situation… arises when A dies.

John Rogers: And B has to give A a proper funeral, whatever the hell that means, before B gets it. So the question becomes, what happens in the in-between interim?

John Rogers: Well, if the contingent remainder does not vest

John Rogers: at the time of A's death, so if B's interest does not become vested the moment A dies.

John Rogers: it destructs.

John Rogers: It's gone.

John Rogers: So, it would then just cancel out, and then O would then just have a V-simple absolute.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: That's common law. Let's do another example.

doven: Are you saying that in between, A dyes and B,

doven: Does not give him a proper funeral, then?

doven: It's over for B.

John Rogers: is over for B. B, you are done. You get… Got it.

John Rogers: Okay? Modernally, what happens is this.

John Rogers: it would then go back to O.

John Rogers: For a reasonable period of time.

John Rogers: So that B could give A a proper funeral.

John Rogers: And then what happens is that these interests transposes into an executor interest and takes it from O.

John Rogers: Let's begin. O presumably has a, the simple absolute, A

John Rogers: has a present possessory interest in a life estate, with A being the, blah blah, measuring life. We've seen that before. B has a contingent remainder, okay? The contingent remainder, because B must get that A+.

John Rogers: tired of taking. Others don't get it.

John Rogers: So, it's possible that B will never, no matter how hard B tries, no matter how hard B studies, no matter how

John Rogers: Hard B cheats or kisses the teacher's ass. B may never, ever get an A+.

John Rogers: So… O will retain that reversion.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So… What happens… When A dies.

John Rogers: and B hasn't taken the final exam yet.

John Rogers: it just kind of floats around. Maybe it kind of just goes to, like… You know, fantasy land.

John Rogers: For a little bit. What happens to it?

Agnes Gholoonian: Does it go back to O?

John Rogers: Well… Drugs?

John Rogers: Under the common law, It destructs.

John Rogers: It's gone, because B's interest did not vest

John Rogers: at the time of A's death.

John Rogers: So, it's… golf.

John Rogers: Goodbye.

John Rogers: Ta-da! Gone.

John Rogers: Modernly, what happens is it will go back to O, And then, if… Modernly, what happens…

John Rogers: is that it will go back to O,

John Rogers: B will then have an executive interest, an O will have a…

John Rogers: Fee simple subject to executory limitation.

John Rogers: We'll get to that.

doven: Can you repeat that?

John Rogers: I'm gonna throw some examples to you next week, so don't worry.

John Rogers: So, what happens in this case is, under common law, common law, B's interest…

John Rogers: if not vested at the time of A's death, will destruct.

John Rogers: destructibility of contingent remainders. It's not destructibility of executory interest, it's not destructibility of remainders, it's destructibility of contingent remainders. So think of it like that interest

John Rogers: B's interest is not vested the moment A dies. If that's the case, and they have.

John Rogers: Well, they do have an, A contingent remainder.

John Rogers: And the contingent remainder will blow up.

John Rogers: And be destroyed.

John Rogers: Question.

doven: So in the modern,

doven: O takes over for a little while, and B gets the time to take to…

doven: real property test to get an A+.

John Rogers: That's right! I love that! O will get it for a little bit amount of time. I like that. And then, so, since O is subject to having it taken from them, O's interest, O will have a fee simple subject to executory limitation.

John Rogers: let's move on. The next type is, and I might need your help, because I forgot. I don't know if the next,

John Rogers: doctrine is worthier title, or the rule of Shelley's case, I think it's worthier title, if I'm not mistaken.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Doctrine of merger.

John Rogers: is…

Vahe Baghdasaryan: And then it's rules in Shelly's case.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: And then Dalton of Worth Year title.

John Rogers: In my notes?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yeah.

Karen Hernandez: Yes.

John Rogers: In the perfect outline.

John Rogers: Alright. Just melted my heart. That just absolutely just melted my heart. Oh, man. But now the…

John Rogers: seas of the Arctic have frozen my heart, now it's down dead, never to be resurrected, but it was really nice while it lasted.

John Rogers: So, let's go into… The doctrine… I will go into the rule in Shelley's case, okay?

John Rogers: Now, unfortunately, we'll never meet Shelly, and we don't have a case on Shelly.

John Rogers: Maybe someone can text her.

John Rogers: The rule in Shelly's case, right?

John Rogers: Says, when an instrument, like a deed, a will, some type of instrument that purports to convey an interest in a grantee.

John Rogers: in life.

John Rogers: And the future interest In that individual's heirs, Those two different estates will merge together Because it will be…

John Rogers: It'll merge into a single interest.

John Rogers: Which will have the same result.

John Rogers: For example, in my notes.

John Rogers: Now, I would break this down like this. Oh, he has a fee simple absolute, presumably, paid.

John Rogers: Has a present possessory interest.

John Rogers: Ugh.

John Rogers: in a life estate, with A being the measure.

John Rogers: And then A's heirs… Have a contingent remainder.

John Rogers: And then O will have a reversion, okay? So we just identified what everybody has, okay? So then let's apply the rule in Shelly's case. The rule says if an instrument purports to convey to a grantee

John Rogers: An interest in life, And that same grantee

John Rogers: another interest is conveyed in fee to their heirs, A's heirs, the two estates will merge.

John Rogers: Making it read as if it says O2A.

John Rogers: So, A would have a fee simple absolute. It's just taking these two interests.

John Rogers: and merging them together. Because when A dies, the interest will filter to A's heirs. So why not just convert these two interests to a fee-simple Absolute?

John Rogers: This is tested. I've tested this 3 times, probably, in 12 years.

John Rogers: Yep.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: So, it's a grantee and the grantee's heirs.

John Rogers: The estates merge.

John Rogers: In life, in fee, Errors, merge.

John Rogers: Similarly, The Doctrine of Worthier title.

John Rogers: This is a similar doctrine, except it's not a future interest in the grantee, but it's a future interest in the grantor's heirs.

John Rogers: For example, O… 2A for life.

John Rogers: Then, two O's… Heirs!

John Rogers: So, I would say O, presumably, has a fee simple absolute, A has a present possessory interest in a life estate.

John Rogers: with A being… the measuring life, And then owes…

John Rogers: Heirs have a contingent remainder, and then O would then have a reversion. So then I would apply the doctrine of worthier title, WT,

John Rogers: WTF… And, heh, the… then owes heirs interest here?

John Rogers: would merge with O.

John Rogers: So, it would just be…

doven: O to A for life!

John Rogers: There's no reason to have O's heirs. Why not just say O to A for love?

John Rogers: Just like here.

John Rogers: O to A. O2A, but then it's just O to A for life. So this one, where their title, is an instrument that purports to convey title to

John Rogers: A grantee, in life, And the future interest in the grantor's heirs.

John Rogers: Whereas Shelly's case, Is an interest that purports to convey interest in the grantee's life.

John Rogers: And then the remainder in the grantee's heirs.

John Rogers: So why not just cut the gristle and merge the two estates together?

doven: How… how would we know on exam if one of these show up? What would be a hint?

John Rogers: Would it be a hint?

doven: Just look at… What the word do you say?

John Rogers: Yeah.

doven: I will be.

John Rogers: I'll throw it in there, I'll give you an example next week. I'll give you plenty of examples of this next week, don't worry.

John Rogers: And I've tested this 3 times on finals, so we'll go over those when we start attacking the essays. Give you plenty of examples.

John Rogers: Don't worry about that.

John Rogers: Now, the doctrine of merger, I never have independently taught.

John Rogers: And I don't know if in my notes.

John Rogers: I don't know if I actually…

John Rogers: teach that separately, but I usually just teach it in conjunction with the rule in Shelley's case and the doctrine of worthier title, because you couple those two interests with the doctrine of merger.

John Rogers: So you'll… I don't require for binding exam purposes, individual examinees to write the doctrine of Werger as its own

John Rogers: mechanism, but you can include it in your discussion of doctrine of worthy or Title or the rule of Shelley's case, rule in Shelley's case.

John Rogers: So you can just, in your discussion there, say that the due estates will merge via the doctrine of merger.

John Rogers: Et cetera, et cetera.

John Rogers: Questions?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yeah, I didn't get what any of that meant right there.

John Rogers: Haha, what? What part?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Voting.

John Rogers: hard.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: When you said to use it in our analysis, how would we use that in our analysis?

John Rogers: It's because these two estates merge together.

John Rogers: And they transition into one interest, which is a fee-simple absolute.

John Rogers: Okay.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Okay.

John Rogers: And these interest holders merge.

John Rogers: Make sense?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yeah. True.

John Rogers: The doctrine of merger.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Makes sense, got it.

John Rogers: You got it?

John Rogers: You got it?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Got it.

John Rogers: Alright, you got it because I'm the best!

John Rogers: Alright, so any other questions?

doven: I was paying attention, but… can you show that again?

doven: My brain… I'm brain dead, I mean, it's like…

John Rogers: It's okay. So, he was referring…

John Rogers: to the doctrine of merger, and you couple

John Rogers: the rule in Shelley's case, or the doctrine of worthier title, with

John Rogers: the doctrine of merger, and it just simply collects two interests together and transitions them. So, there's two interests here, for example, O to A for life, then to A's heirs. Think to yourself, why are there two interests? Why not just

John Rogers: Merge them into one.

John Rogers: It operates identically to this.

John Rogers: Right? Am I wrong?

John Rogers: It's the same thing! It's the same thing.

doven: You're right.

John Rogers: So, I don't teach the doctrine of merger independent. I just say couple that in your discussion. Just say doctrine of murder. So, I don't…

John Rogers: So, what I'm trying to tell you right now is this. If the doctrine of Worthier title is a discussion, or the rule in Shelley's case, there's a discussion on an essay within a final exam, just make sure in either of those discussions, you write the doctrine of merger, or merger, in there somewhere, and you'll be just fine.

John Rogers: Questions?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Yeah, can you repeat that, Professor, please?

John Rogers: Repeat what?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Like, should we write Doctor of Worthier title, Doctor of Merger, and the essay?

John Rogers: You know, I'm tired of talking about the doctrine of merger. Forget it. Just put a shotgun to it and never talk about it ever again, okay?

John Rogers: Don't worry about it, because you'd have to use the word merge when you discuss these. It comes together.

John Rogers: So, these interests right here come together, they merge into a fee-simple absolute, because this is exactly the same as this.

John Rogers: This… Is exactly the same as this.

John Rogers: It's just merging interests.

John Rogers: Questions.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: We are now going into the rule against perpetuities.

John Rogers: to begin this discussion. This is the worst part of the class. Everybody hates it. There's only one person in the world that actually really likes it.

John Rogers: But has yet to be, evaluated by psychiatrist. But…

John Rogers: There was a case that was published in California in the 1970s, if I'm not mistaken, okay? And it was called Lucas v. Ham, like a ham sandwich.

John Rogers: Aunt.

John Rogers: this rule… Is very complicated that we are going to learn.

John Rogers: It is very complicated.

John Rogers: What happened in that case is that there were some individuals… there was an individual that went to an attorney.

John Rogers: and said, I want this to happen with my estate when I die. And so this attorney wrote out a will.

John Rogers: When that person died, the client died, It was later determined that the interests Violated the rule against perpetuities.

John Rogers: So the beneficiary didn't get anything.

John Rogers: So, the beneficiaries sued the attorney for malpractice.

John Rogers: went all the way up to the California Supreme Court.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: The California Supreme Court, I believe it was 1978, someone could find out, said, held.

John Rogers: This rule is so complicated.

John Rogers: That we are not going to hold an attorney liable for malpractice if they write a will that violates it.

John Rogers: Unless… They hold themselves out as a specialist.

John Rogers: So as long as someone's not a specialist.

John Rogers: can't be sued for malpractice, because it is a very complicated role. Specialist.

John Rogers: So if you're a specialist, be different, because you're held to a much higher standard.

John Rogers: Like, in criminal law. I'm a criminal defense attorney, but I have board certification. I'm a board-certified criminal law specialist.

John Rogers: So, if I screw up, I'm not held to the reasonable attorney standard. I'm held to the reasonable

John Rogers: Criminal law specialist standard, which is much higher.

John Rogers: which kind of… makes me wonder why I even have it. Ha! But anyways… But…

John Rogers: This rule is very complicated.

John Rogers: And what I want you to do is not… Try to learn it.

John Rogers: But know how it operates.

John Rogers: The beauty of this…

John Rogers: is that it's okay. I never learned it. So, when I was in law school land myself.

John Rogers: When I took property, my teacher just said, this is the rule against perpetuities, this is the rule, there's some examples in your book, let me know if you have any questions. Moving on.

John Rogers: So I never even knew what it was.

John Rogers: And when I sat for bar review, I was just sitting there, hmm, doo-do-do-do-do-do-do, and they spent 8 hours lecturing on it. I'm like, man, I didn't even learn this. I'm just not going to learn it.

John Rogers: But I never learned it.

John Rogers: But all these people in Barbie were like, hey, God, you gotta know this, you gotta know this.

John Rogers: We don't, but… So I never learned it, and the only…

John Rogers: reason I ever learned this rule is because I had to teach this class. I had to read the Horn Book.

John Rogers: So… It's okay.

John Rogers: But they did test it on the bar in an essay last year.

John Rogers: Holy… WTF.

John Rogers: And I'll go over it with you.

John Rogers: And it wasn't very hard.

John Rogers: It was not.

John Rogers: So… The rule against perpetuities is a common law concept.

John Rogers: You apply the common law rule.

John Rogers: No interest is good unless it must best, if at all, no matter 21 years after some life of being at the time alive at its creation.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: does anybody want to volunteer? And it's okay, I'm not going to ask you really anything property-related, it's more just like, what did you learn in grade school?

John Rogers: So, does anybody, like, want to volunteer to ask Have me ask them basic… grade… high school GED questions.

Avi Omrany: volunteer professor.

John Rogers: I love hearing your voice.

John Rogers: What is this?

Avi Omrany: A highlighter?

John Rogers: It's a highlighter! That's correct!

John Rogers: Now…

John Rogers: I'm holding it with these fingers right here, right? Here's a highlighter, and then, look, look what happens, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look! I… oh, whoa, I caught it!

John Rogers: What happened?

John Rogers: What… what happened?

John Rogers: Like, when I don't… when I, like, move my fingers back, like, away, it goes down.

John Rogers: How?

Avi Omrany: Gravity?

John Rogers: Oh, because of gravity!

John Rogers: What's gravity?

Avi Omrany: Gravity is the Earth's orbit pulling in centrifugal force, causing weight to be absorbed by a larger mass.

John Rogers: So is gravity only on Earth?

Avi Omrany: No.

John Rogers: I don't… is it centrifugal force?

Avi Omrany: You said grade school, this is… this is harder.

John Rogers: What do you mean? It goes down, right? It just goes down.

Avi Omrany: Gravity.

John Rogers: But you don't really know what gravity is.

Avi Omrany: Like, a larger mass causing the pull of other masses.

John Rogers: Does this highlighter have gravity? Does it, like, have a gravitational pull at all?

Avi Omrany: affected by gravity.

John Rogers: So this does not… there's no gravity, so if I put this in space…

John Rogers: It's not gonna have any gravity?

John Rogers: What is it? Like, what is gravity?

John Rogers: You said grade school.

John Rogers: So, what I'm getting at is this.

John Rogers: you know.

John Rogers: Now, you drop something, it goes down!

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: We know this because of gravity, but we just don't know what it is. We just know the answer is, oh, because of gravity. But don't ask me to explain it, because that's just what it is.

John Rogers: So, what we know is this.

John Rogers: You drop a highlighter, it goes down!

John Rogers: We don't really know why, exactly, we just know.

John Rogers: For this rule, I just want you to know, this is what it does.

John Rogers: and not… Why?

John Rogers: Does it do that?

John Rogers: So I WILL get questions. Professor, why did I… I'm gonna go, oh no!

John Rogers: I don't care about why.

John Rogers: Because I don't think in the long run, you're really going to be registering this.

John Rogers: I'd rather you know. It's just what it is.

John Rogers: Kind of like asking your parents as a kid, Mom, Dad, why does the highlighter fall? Because of gravity. Well, what's gravity?

John Rogers: It just falls. Fascinating.

John Rogers: It just falls. That's perfect, I love that.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: This rule, it just does what it does. That's what I want you to know, okay?

John Rogers: So, we are going to begin with the common pitfalls.

John Rogers: You are here to determine if this interest is void or valid.

John Rogers: In week one, I gave you, I think, an attachment, or otherwise I just copied it and pasted it in my notes, where it says, the rule against perpetuities.

John Rogers: the common pitfalls.

John Rogers: This is what I want you to know. We are going to begin with the GED basics.

John Rogers: Alright?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Ugh.

John Rogers: Who can break this down?

John Rogers: Fascinating.

Fatima Razavi: O equals FSA, A is… present… Possessory Interests in FSSEL.

Fatima Razavi: B is an executory interest in life.

Fatima Razavi: And O equals reversion.

John Rogers: Why do you say out of life?

John Rogers: Why life?

John Rogers: It doesn't say otherwise to be for life, right?

John Rogers: Yes, you're right. Sorry, I had myself on mute, you're right. That's it. Okay. So, we… the rule against perpetuities is triggered when you see executory interests

John Rogers: contingent remainder. Ugh.

John Rogers: Or, or vested remainder, Subject to open.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Anytime you ever see any of these interests ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever moving forward till the end of time, you talk about rap.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Forever and ever and ever.

John Rogers: No interest is good unless it must vest no later than 21 years after some life and being at the time of its creation.

John Rogers: Boom. What does that mean?

John Rogers: Well, I'm going to tell you that this rule, as it applies to executory interests, destroys executory interests. It voids that interest.

John Rogers: due to remote vesting, meaning we don't know when B will ever get this.

John Rogers: Okay? So, the best thing that you can do

John Rogers: Is when you see a situation just like this.

John Rogers: You always know Always.

John Rogers: In this situation, B's interest will always be Void.

John Rogers: Always.

John Rogers: So, what you do is, is you just cross this out.

John Rogers: Boom. And it just reads, O to A, so long as Black Acre is used for residential purposes only.

John Rogers: That's it! And then, since rap voids out this interest, O will have a possibility.

John Rogers: of reverter.

John Rogers: Now, let me kind of explain this to you.

John Rogers: The rule wants to void out uncertainty.

John Rogers: So let me ask you this.

John Rogers: How long?

John Rogers: could A or A's heirs continue to use Black Acre for residential purposes? Along.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Forever.

John Rogers: Or ever and ever and ever until the end of time.

John Rogers: But, there's always this bee here, and B's airs. How long are they gonna be there for?

John Rogers: from what's written there, forever and ever and ever until the end of time. So we have these two interests that will be there forever!

John Rogers: So we don't know when B's or B's heirs will ever get it.

John Rogers: So the rule will void out this uncertainty.

John Rogers: So, when you see this situation.

John Rogers: I want you to tell yourself this.

John Rogers: O.

John Rogers: A.

John Rogers: and B.

John Rogers: won a trip.

John Rogers: 2… Where?

John Rogers: Where are they going?

John Rogers: Where are they going?

daniel Saghian: volume.

John Rogers: Bali.

John Rogers: They want a trip to Bali to get eaten alive by mosquitoes.

John Rogers: So, they get in the plane, And all of a sudden, The plane takes off.

John Rogers: Pilot is drunk and falls asleep, and the plane crashes, and everybody dies. O, A, and B are dead.

John Rogers: Dead.

John Rogers: When A dies, Where's the property go?

John Rogers: Where'd it go?

doven: -Oh.

John Rogers: In this situation, ugh.

Amir Akbari: 2As… A's…

John Rogers: A's airs, because A has it in B.

John Rogers: If B dies, Who succeeds the B's interest?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: P's theirs.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Fair.

John Rogers: So… The rule against perpetuities voids out possibilities.

John Rogers: Not what actually happens, but possibilities

John Rogers: that are measured at the time the interest was created. Not what happens.

John Rogers: But at the time the interest is created.

John Rogers: So… Is it… possible.

John Rogers: that if O, A, and B all die.

John Rogers: Is it possible that A's heirs could continue

John Rogers: To abide by the residential purposes requirement.

John Rogers: for more.

John Rogers: than 21 years.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yes.

John Rogers: since it's… Possible.

John Rogers: B's interest will be void.

John Rogers: So, O will have a possibility reverter.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: Notice here, If you ever see this situation, It will always be… Void.

John Rogers: Always.

John Rogers: because…

John Rogers: it will just continue to go forever. A will continue to have it forever, or A's heirs, and B's heirs will continue to have it forever and ever and ever and ever until the end of time.

John Rogers: So… Put everyone on a plane.

John Rogers: Have them die.

John Rogers: or parachute somewhere and land in a volcano. I don't care, okay?

John Rogers: Then ask yourself, if everybody dies, is it possible that Ace Heirs could continue to use it longer than 21 years?

John Rogers: If it's… yes.

John Rogers: than B's heirs?

John Rogers: Or goodbye! Good night, see you later, you don't get it.

John Rogers: We don't care what actually does happen.

John Rogers: It's measured at the time of creation.

John Rogers: So, same, same thing.

John Rogers: O2A on condition that Black Acre is

John Rogers: Use for residential purposes otherwise to be.

John Rogers: Same thing.

John Rogers: Same thing.

John Rogers: The only difference is it's so long as, and it says on condition at, but it operates identical.

John Rogers: The only weird situation is this.

John Rogers: If… B's interest is void.

John Rogers: What does A have?

John Rogers: Because there's no right of entry language.

John Rogers: I had a debate with one of my colleagues who doesn't teach property anymore, he had to leave a few years ago.

John Rogers: But we taught our class that says, if that happens, automatically create a right of entry in O, because it seems to… to… to go with O's intent.

John Rogers: But… this situation, look out for. O, 2A. But if…

John Rogers: Black Acre is used for anything other than residential purposes.

John Rogers: than to B.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: This is very different, okay? Let's break this down.

John Rogers: A has a present accessory interest. Present possessor…

John Rogers: Have I just been repeating myself? Hold on.

John Rogers: Okay, present possessory interest, interest, okay, whatever, present possessory interest in…

John Rogers: A fee simple subject to executory limitation, right?

John Rogers: B has what?

Aram Harutyunyan: Executory interest.

John Rogers: In…

Vahe Baghdasaryan: B.

John Rogers: The simple absolute yes, okay?

John Rogers: We apply the rule against perpetuities.

John Rogers: Okay? So, is it possible that if everyone were to get on a plane to Moscow, And then it…

John Rogers: crashes in Bucharest, Romania, and everybody dies.

John Rogers: Is it possible that A's heirs

John Rogers: could continue to use Blackacre for residential purposes?

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: So bee's heirs may not get it for more than 21 years.

John Rogers: So, B's interest… voids B's interest, right?

John Rogers: But… This is where things get cute.

John Rogers: But if… Is connected to than to be.

John Rogers: So, in this situation, This entire sentence, almost.

John Rogers: is void.

John Rogers: Which means… A.

John Rogers: Has a fee simple absolute.

John Rogers: We are talking about executory interest.

doven: So, if it says then to be, cross up that hole from buck if to… Yeah, but otherwise…

doven: don't you?

John Rogers: Get rid of it, stab it. Take a shotgun to its head.

John Rogers: Shotgun to head.

John Rogers: Let's do this.

John Rogers: Wants to break this down.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: So, O as feasible absolute.

John Rogers: Presumably, yes.

Aram Harutyunyan: A has… Present possessor interest in a fee simple subject to executory limitations.

John Rogers: Beautiful.

Aram Harutyunyan: Executory interest for life?

John Rogers: And then O has what?

Aram Harutyunyan: Remember.

John Rogers: Ends with life.

Karen Hernandez: Brief version.

John Rogers: Correct.

John Rogers: Now, we've determined what everyone has.

John Rogers: Now we look at the validity of those interests. So we have an executory interest here, so we have to apply the rule against perpetuities. Based on what I have

John Rogers: hold you.

John Rogers: Would this be… Void?

John Rogers: or valid.

John Rogers: Now… Before you answer, compare what is written right here with what these examples are written here.

John Rogers: Because we see void.

John Rogers: Void!

John Rogers: Void beads interest.

John Rogers: Void, void, same thing. So, same thing means void.

John Rogers: Would the same?

John Rogers: thing apply here.

Aram Harutyunyan: No, because it'll go to B either way, even if the condition isn't met.

John Rogers: Say that again?

Aram Harutyunyan: No, because even if it's not used for residential purposes, he'll go to B.

John Rogers: Well… Let's do the plane crash.

John Rogers: Scenario.

John Rogers: O, A, and B all get on a plane because they want to go visit, finally in their life, Bucharest, Romania.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: And the plane crashes, and they're dead.

John Rogers: What?

John Rogers: happens.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Does that go to O's heiress?

John Rogers: Well, did A breach?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: No.

John Rogers: So, A's heirs would take over, right?

John Rogers: Do Bee's heirs get an interest?

doven: Well, 8 years can possibly do it for 21 years.

John Rogers: But… That one I remember.

John Rogers: It's uncertainty of when a future interest holder will even get it.

John Rogers: So I'm asking you this.

John Rogers: Do bee's heirs ever get anything?

gevorg kulikyan: Is it they don't because the interest that B has is the life measuring of B.

John Rogers: That's it!

John Rogers: Correct! Rap is valid!

John Rogers: It's valid, it's not gonna be void, because it's not gonna be going on forever. If everybody dies, it's not gonna go to B's heirs, so who cares? So B's interest will vest, or fail to vest, at some point within B's life.

John Rogers: It's valid.

John Rogers: Ugh. Ugh.

John Rogers: Bring you down.

doven: O-H-F-S-A…

doven: Ppl, mmm… F-S-S-E-O.

John Rogers: Life, estate, subject to… Executory limitations.

doven: -Oh.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: Because it's… to a…

John Rogers: my wife.

John Rogers: then B has what?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Executory interest… And fee simple absolute.

John Rogers: Correct. Now, you have to apply the rule against perpetuities to B's executor interest. So…

John Rogers: Is it gonna be valid or void?

doven: Boyd, possibly.

John Rogers: Well, let's put everybody on a plane.

John Rogers: We're going to Romania, finally! We can finally visit the castles and get bit by a vampire. God.

John Rogers: But the plane crashes, and everyone dies.

John Rogers: What happens to A's heirs' interest? Do they even have an interest?

John Rogers: It's not gonna go on forever.

John Rogers: It's only gonna go on for the duration of A's life.

John Rogers: So there… it is not going to be infinity. It's not going to be floating around there in perpetuity.

John Rogers: B's executory interests will not… be there longer than A's life. So if everybody dies.

John Rogers: Done! Who's got it in Feast Simple Absolute?

John Rogers: pallet.

doven: That's very interesting.

John Rogers: and some people.

doven: Will we get a copy of that?

John Rogers: bring a copy of it. Can some people write me a…

John Rogers: private message. I want to know… your thoughts?

John Rogers: Preferably people I don't hear from.

John Rogers: And I won't call you out, I promise.

John Rogers: I just want to know what is going on in your brain. Tell me the truth, don't lie to me. I just want to know if…

John Rogers: how you're feeling. You can be honest, I'm not gonna call you out, I promise. I just need to know.

Yessenia Soria: Honestly, I feel like I'm doing math with words.

John Rogers: Can you write me a private message if… Someone did.

John Rogers: Some people are scared, some people are maybe, like, a 5 out of 10. Alright.

John Rogers: So… If I go over this next week, which I will, I don't,

John Rogers: Yeah, some people are nervous about writing this in an essay. I agree.

John Rogers: Hold on, was it 920? 925 notes?

John Rogers: I'm gonna drop this into…

John Rogers: What we have learned… Sorry, he had some funny comments.

John Rogers: So, to address one of the questions, is that…

John Rogers: We have not covered all of RAP. We're only covering right now as it relates to executory interests. So, next class, I'm going to be going over contingent remainders and vested remainders subject to open.

John Rogers: So, it's not gonna be covering Everything.

John Rogers: Tonight. But, this is important.

doven: Professor, you're gonna give us to this?

doven: Sorry.

John Rogers: Just dropped it in the chat. Hold on, hold on.

John Rogers: So, to address some of your questions.

John Rogers: Noticeably, the ones that had life in it?

John Rogers: were valid.

John Rogers: So, it means that the executor interest is not going to be crossed out. It will be upheld, it will remain.

John Rogers: The interests that were void.

John Rogers: Will be crossed out.

John Rogers: As if it didn't exist.

John Rogers: Because it goes on.

John Rogers: forever. It potentially goes on forever.

John Rogers: And the rule doesn't want things to be floating around.

John Rogers: In perpetuity forever.

John Rogers: But if you notice, the ones that were upheld that said life.

John Rogers: Those were upheld because the maximum amount of time

John Rogers: That those interests will exist is someone's life.

John Rogers: So… Just put everyone in a plane.

John Rogers: Have a crash.

John Rogers: Or maybe everyone goes to dinner at a serial killer's house, and everybody dies! Do whatever it is that you want to do.

John Rogers: Do we care if the interest survives them? If it's for life, then that's it. It's upheld, it's cool, because it's only going to last for their life. It's not going to last forever.

John Rogers: It's not gonna survive their deaths.

John Rogers: So it's not gonna go on forever. The maximum?

John Rogers: That it will be there is someone's life.

John Rogers: So it's not gonna be floating around.

John Rogers: In perpetuity forever.

John Rogers: Makes sense?

John Rogers: Okay, you don't have to understand rap.

John Rogers: All you just have to really know is I gave you a bunch of examples.

John Rogers: So if you see that situation, you know it's void.

John Rogers: So next week, for example, If I give you some examples, I just drop my notes into the chat.

John Rogers: If I give you those same examples, worded differently.

John Rogers: Would you be able to spot it?

John Rogers: Because…

John Rogers: When I tell my class, yes, you're gonna be tested on rep. It's gonna be on your final, oh no!

John Rogers: They have the answer.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: It's okay if you don't understand this.

John Rogers: why don't you go reach out to your non-existent friends in the other classes? They will have no clue.

John Rogers: What they're talking about.

John Rogers: Oh, you know what?

John Rogers: I dropped my notes into Read AI Meeting Notes.

John Rogers: Ha! My bad. Let me drop it.

John Rogers: There we go, you see it now?

Karen Hernandez: Yes.

doven: Thank you!

John Rogers: You're welcome.

John Rogers: But you're not going to understand this, so don't…

doven: Understood.

John Rogers: leave… tonight, thinking I should be… this should be clicking, it's okay, it's gonna be taking time.

John Rogers: Okay? But next week, we're going to be going over contingent remainders.

John Rogers: And vested remainders subject to open.

John Rogers: Now, I don't typically teach full-on rap discussions, I look for the key points that you need to know.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: I think it's better.

John Rogers: Once you know those.

John Rogers: you'd be fine.

John Rogers: Okay? But ask anyone that's in their… that's a 3L or 4L, they're not gonna know what we're talking about.

John Rogers: It's forgotten.

John Rogers: Awesome.

John Rogers: there is a student mentor doing property. I was very surprised, because I don't think we had one last year.

John Rogers: So, surprisingly, he is in my evidence class.

John Rogers: So, Definitely reach out to him.

John Rogers: I'm sure you guys all got the email, reach out to him, figure out what his sessions are. He's, I believe, gonna be mentoring with

John Rogers: one of my former students, Nicholas, who I'm sure some of you guys know.

John Rogers: Super good guy. Good guy. He survived a beating from me.

John Rogers: That guy survived a beating from me.

John Rogers: Snarky comments to him never fazed him.

John Rogers: And I tried so hard, never phased him. Kept his school.

John Rogers: And you know what? I found out a few weeks ago, he got an A in this class.

John Rogers: Didn't see that coming. So definitely reach out to him, you can hound him, get his texts, find his, find his phone number.

John Rogers: text him like crazy. If you're taking evidence, two of my former students are, mentoring evidence, so definitely reach out to them. They were very bright in my evidence class. And then I do know that,

John Rogers: former student, Toursney?

John Rogers: She's doing torts.

John Rogers: go to her sessions, she did well in this class, and then maybe you can,

John Rogers: Ask her property questions.

John Rogers: And then, the dean, Dean Frickberg, I heard, is teaching contracts again.

John Rogers: The beauty of that?

John Rogers: Is you can also ask him property questions.

John Rogers: Because he used to teach.

John Rogers: this class.

John Rogers: So… Ask him when you see him.

John Rogers: property questions, and tell him that I said it's okay.

John Rogers: And then report back to me what he says!

John Rogers: But you do have a lot of… Hmm.

John Rogers: Resources available for you?

John Rogers: I'm usually always available by phone, because I'm always in the car.

John Rogers: So… to be continued.

John Rogers: next week.

John Rogers: Any… Questions.

John Rogers: Well, I would love to hear from some of you, so if you want to be friends.

Yessenia Soria: I have a question, Professor.

Yessenia Soria: So, for the reading, what… what week are we in? Because I'm, like, totally lost, because,

Yessenia Soria: I thought we were gonna be on week 9, but… I don't know.

John Rogers: Cover all of future interests?

John Rogers: Next class. So we'll just do the book. Okay.

Yessenia Soria: So that's 7. Okay.

John Rogers: So, congratulations. So this is rock bottom. This is the rock bottom.

John Rogers: You're at the rock bottom right now!

John Rogers: That's not too bad, right?

John Rogers: Not bad, right?

John Rogers: Anyways, what I will do is, you all are paroled.

John Rogers: Have a wonderful week, just make sure that you eat leaves, outside.

John Rogers: Okay, so the sun is physically hitting your skin while you're eating leaves.

John Rogers: See you next week, I will stick around. Anyone has questions.

Yessenia Soria: Thank you, Professor. Have a good night. Stay safe.

Karen Hernandez: Cue.

Fatima Razavi: Thank you.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: I have a question about.

Amir Akbari: Rap, the measuring is, like, every time we should put them on the plane, then, see after that what's gonna happen to the…

Amir Akbari: Old scenario, right?

John Rogers: I don't know what you're saying.

John Rogers: I…

Amir Akbari: Rule against perfuity. I'm just thinking the measure, if we wanna see what's gonna happen at the end.

Amir Akbari: We should put OAB on the plane, then, see after that what's gonna happen.

Amir Akbari: To the whole scenario, right?

Amir Akbari: If it's not… if it's not going…

John Rogers: I'm not following, so wait, it's just… what's the question? Rule against perpetuities, what about.

Amir Akbari: Okay, I wanna test the rule.

Amir Akbari: When I want to test the rule, I will put OAB on the plane.

Amir Akbari: then, I'm gonna see what's gonna happen to the whole rule, right?

Amir Akbari: then I measure the A, B, C, situation.

Amir Akbari: Then, if it was something going to the, forever.

Amir Akbari: or there was any conflict between A and B, Right?

Amir Akbari: I… I should take out some part, like, like a wrist train.

John Rogers: Yeah, the remedy is kind of like a restraint.

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: What you really want to be looking for is that executor interest, because that executive interest is what is subject to the rule.

John Rogers: So, in the situation, in regards to executory interest, just put everybody in a plane.

Amir Akbari: In a plane.

John Rogers: Okay.

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: Crash and see what happens.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, that's my question.

John Rogers: anyway.

Amir Akbari: Okay.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, that's… I just want to make sure I can do that test and figure out what… Wrong.

John Rogers: What's up with everyone in class? No one says anything. Kind of curious what's happening, guys? Girls?

John Rogers: Why does peop- why does no one say anything?

John Rogers: Gets me nervous when people don't say things, that's why.

maddykoshkaryan: We like to listen.

John Rogers: All right.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I think people are trying to just see if they go back and figure it out, and then if they don't, they'll come back and say something, I think? I don't know.

John Rogers: I usually, about week 14, get a call From students saying.

John Rogers: I don't have a clue what we did this semester, and I need help.

John Rogers: So, my advice is always, like, let's be friends now.

John Rogers: So… but I just feel that students are… are…

John Rogers: timid to actually do that. Maybe they don't want to reveal

John Rogers: The fact that they're just not understanding it, and they're maybe hearing people that Do you understand it.

John Rogers: No. But obviously, I'm not expecting anyone to really get this.

John Rogers: So if you're not… if it's having… if you're having trouble…

John Rogers: If it's not clicking, it's okay. It's gonna take time. Total time. Thanksgiving.

John Rogers: Thanks, Gary.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Are you gonna do, like, potentially, like, a full review, but, like, in a more…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I don't know how to explain it. Maybe at the end.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Ish?

John Rogers: What I typically do, I don't have reviews, I have, I just go over essays. I go over, like.

John Rogers: 15 essays.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Yeah.

maddykoshkaryan: That's gonna be very helpful.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: beneficial, yeah, because what you're talking about, I don't know how I'm gonna click it into, like, a essay format, like, O to A, like, da-da-da-da, like…

maddykoshkaryan: But I have a question, sorry to cut you off. The sample essays that you sent over, you did mention that those were taken in class and they only had an hour to do, right?

John Rogers: Yes, real final exam. They took a real final exam.

maddykoshkaryan: So, obviously, what you're expecting from us is probably… Five times that.

John Rogers: Yes! That's 1 hour. You got… we got 24…

maddykoshkaryan: Great.

John Rogers: Oh, no, 24… you don't understand!

maddykoshkaryan: Well, in 24 hours, it's not like we're taking a 24-hour exam. We're only gonna probably work on it for…

maddykoshkaryan: 4 hours?

John Rogers: I don't know, I've never tasted.

maddykoshkaryan: Thank you very much.

John Rogers: 24-hour final, I don't know!

maddykoshkaryan: It's much more deceiving.

John Rogers: I don't know, I mean, I seem to think that there's some students with OCD that would just be glued to…

John Rogers: to do it, I don't know.

maddykoshkaryan: Can I ask one more question for you. The outline of the actual essays, I did review a lot of them. You want it to be in that format?

John Rogers: of, of the…

maddykoshkaryan: Of the way it was written, like, the ones that took it in an hour?

John Rogers: I don't, have any…

maddykoshkaryan: Province, okay.

John Rogers: Here's the thing.

John Rogers: I would recommend you do it that way.

John Rogers: To get in the habit of…

John Rogers: doing that for, like, bar exam purposes, but for my class, you can write your exam in a single paragraph backwards that I have to read in a mirror.

John Rogers: It'd be fine.

maddykoshkaryan: Okay, great.

maddykoshkaryan: Yeah, because certain professors are super technical, like, it has to be IRAC, it has to be broken down, it has to be this, so that's why I always like to…

John Rogers: Look.

maddykoshkaryan: This is the stage I like to ask that question.

John Rogers: I'm with them.

John Rogers: But here's the thing, I don't award points.

John Rogers: To organization, to… Volume? Nothing.

John Rogers: It's all discussion.

John Rogers: So, I… I mean, if you…

John Rogers: don't organize it properly, I'm not gonna hold it against you. I would recommend you do that, because…

John Rogers: You don't really want to give me a big, jolly Santa Claus.

John Rogers: paragraph, because then I have to start playing Where's Waldo?

John Rogers: I don't… I was never good at Where's Waldo. They were always too tough for me.

maddykoshkaryan: Yeah.

maddykoshkaryan: So break it down as much as possible, but… Answer?

John Rogers: You know, I'm kidding, right? No, I'm just joking. Where's Waldo?

maddykoshkaryan: No, I understand what you're saying.

maddykoshkaryan: Thank you.

maddykoshkaryan: helpful.

John Rogers: Just make sure it's organized.

John Rogers: Write very mechanical, you'd be just fine.

maddykoshkaryan: Yeah, I sent you a sample essay.

John Rogers: Can I get back to you?

maddykoshkaryan: Oh, it's fine, you don't even have to, I don't even know how I did at this point.

maddykoshkaryan: I'm not even emailing you on that.

maddykoshkaryan: I was just so skeptical of email. No, I'm… I just told myself, I'm just gonna do it, just send it in.

maddykoshkaryan: Let's see.
