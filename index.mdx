## What You'll Find Here

I've organized everything by class and topic because that's apparently what "reasonable people" do. Each section includes:

- **Class notes and outlines** - transcribed during lectures while trying not to fall asleep
- **Case briefs** - my attempts to summarize 40-page opinions into something readable
- **Key concepts and rules** - the important stuff you actually need to remember
- **Practice problems** - because law school wasn't hard enough already
- **Exam prep materials** - aka panic documents

Fair warning: these notes reflect my understanding of the material, which means they're subject to being completely wrong. Use at your own risk, especially before exams.

Navigate using the tabs above, and good luck to both of us.
