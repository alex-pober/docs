# Property - Session 13

## Transcript

John Rogers: Alright, everyone.

John Rogers: Anybody have any… Questions?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I think I have a question.

John Rogers: Alright.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: And when you talk about constructive eviction.

John Rogers: That…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: the person vacates, is there also… is there also a… abandonment conversation, also?

John Rogers: Good question. Here's the thing. The landlord will always claim abandonment. There was no justification.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Mmm.

John Rogers: But the response from the tenant is that there was justification because they were constructively evicted.

John Rogers: And if they're constructively evicted, it means that, It extinguishes.

John Rogers: Their, obligation to pay rent.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: So would you talk about it and not… and not say no?

John Rogers: It is.

John Rogers: I mean, I would probably talk about both?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Both.

John Rogers: Sure.

Amir Akbari: I have a follow-up question on that.

John Rogers: Huh.

Amir Akbari: So when we say the abandonment, it should be without justification, right?

John Rogers: I honestly think that abandonment could almost be mentioned in every single landlord-tenant question, in my opinion.

John Rogers: I feel like it, it, it can,

John Rogers: Because sometimes it's arguable about whether or not someone is constructively evicted. And if it's an arguable point, maybe there is or isn't justification for it then.

Amir Akbari: So if the landlord, argued that this is a… there was without justification, then the tenant, rebouts that and says, okay, there was a, there was a habitability issue.

Amir Akbari: And, because of that, that would justify, right?

John Rogers: There's two ways. I mean, the tenant can assert,

John Rogers: a habitability issue, the tenant could also assert constructive eviction. There's two separate discussions, two separate issues.

John Rogers: But yeah, the tenant can assert both if both are applicable.

Amir Akbari: So it's gonna go under… but the whole thing, it's gonna go under abundance, right? But two different…

John Rogers: Not under abandonment. It'd be totally 3 totally different discussions.

Amir Akbari: Okay.

John Rogers: Three totally different discussions.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: Mr. Dunn.

dovenight: Hi, are we learning, how to… Habitual.

John Rogers: Avidability? We have not.

dovenight: Absolutely. Okay.

John Rogers: I do apologize if I haven't been responsive to a lot of you. It's been a very, very busy week for me.

John Rogers: very busy. I actually can't wait for the holidays.

John Rogers: And you will one day understand this, okay? And it sounds awful of me to say, but you will. I can't wait for the holidays, because everything just goes on autopilot. Courts are closed, no one's working, everyone's enjoying the time. I'm excited not to take time off, but to get caught up with what I'm behind in.

John Rogers: So I'm actually gonna use the time to get caught up with so much stuff I'm just overwhelmed with. So I can't wait.

John Rogers: But you don't understand that, but you will.

John Rogers: You're entering a profession where

John Rogers: I wouldn't hire a lawyer that works 9-5, put it that way.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: You don't want to hire them.

John Rogers: But I have some interesting cases.

John Rogers: Let's talk about your final.

John Rogers: I didn't write it.

John Rogers: I did not write your final exam. It was not written by me.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: My counterpart did, Professor Dolmagian wrote all three questions, okay?

John Rogers: I'll say one thing.

John Rogers: And then veer into something else.

John Rogers: It's a hard final, okay?

John Rogers: One of the questions is not that bad, you're gonna… you're gonna have not very many issues with it. You'll… you'll be fine.

John Rogers: Two of them are tough.

John Rogers: Okay I'm… Going to hold a review.

John Rogers: In this class.

John Rogers: I don't typically do that, I usually just go over essays and whatnot, but I'm actually going to have a review.

John Rogers: I will have one.

John Rogers: I think the final is not vague, or gray, or ambiguous, like I typically, test you on, so, like, a lot of my essays, I don't think they're anything like them.

John Rogers: they're not vague. It's not vague. It's…

John Rogers: What is it? And what's going on?

John Rogers: Versus, like, we're not sure.

John Rogers: But I know it's hard.

John Rogers: I'm telling you, it's hard. Maybe you take it, maybe you don't think it's hard. Perfect, I would melt my heart. I'm going to go into grading knowing it's a hard final, okay? I will be going into that knowing this was a hard final exam.

John Rogers: So that's good, okay? It's good for you.

John Rogers: So don't worry, okay, because that means the standard will be lower, and I feel like there's certain directions people can take, students can take, so I'm not going to hold it against you if you veer off a certain way, so long as it just kind of makes logical sense.

John Rogers: I feel that students might go a couple of ways. So, don't worry, it's okay, I'm… I get it. So, if you open up the file and you read it and you start freaking out.

John Rogers: It's okay. I know it's hard, and just tell yourself this.

John Rogers: That maniac said it was going to be hard. He said it's hard. And he knows it.

John Rogers: It's okay, right?

John Rogers: It's gonna be okay.

John Rogers: I will give you… More than enough information for you to discuss everything.

John Rogers: Okay? It'd be just fine, as long as you pay attention.

John Rogers: From tonight on… You'll be fine.

dovenight: You mentioned grading both your exams right now.

John Rogers: I have a separate grader. We… I… I have a separate grader, okay?

John Rogers: She's been grading for me for, like, 4 years.

John Rogers: She's evil. She's got an evil heart, she has no sympathy, she doesn't care, nothing.

John Rogers: So, her name is Britt.

John Rogers: And, depending on how hard the final is, like, maybe a couple of years ago, the final was really hard, so I'll say, Britt, be nice. And she'll be like, okay.

John Rogers: So I'll tell Britt, be nice this time.

John Rogers: But I will also grade, so what we do is I grade, she grades, and then we kind of talk about it.

John Rogers: Okay? But I'll tell her, Britt, be nice.

John Rogers: And she'll know what that means, okay?

John Rogers: Don't worry, I don't want to freak you out, I don't want you guys to have a mini heart attack now.

John Rogers: It's okay, don't worry, right? It's okay. I'm here to help you, okay?

John Rogers: And I will provide you All the information that you need.

John Rogers: It's just your job.

John Rogers: To figure it out.

John Rogers: I just can't tell you what's on it.

John Rogers: But I will drop a lot of hints between now and until you take the final. Big time.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Oh, no.

John Rogers: Oh, now I gotta pay attention, right?

John Rogers: Oh, no!

John Rogers: I think that my… that finaling this class is actually harder than the evidence final, but I'll let you know

John Rogers: Next class.

John Rogers: I think so.

John Rogers: I shouldn't have told you that, but, any questions?

John Rogers: Yes, you will, if you sent me a private message. You're the only person who did.

John Rogers: you will, I, rummus, and I haven't forgotten about you.

John Rogers: Anything else? Any other questions?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Is there more than one conveyance essay on the final?

John Rogers: Yes. But… they're… they're… They're kind of… they're very similar.

John Rogers: It's a take-home final, so don't freak out. It's okay. Look, it's okay. I'm going to give you all the information that you will need, okay? I'm going to give you all of the information that you will need starting tonight, okay?

John Rogers: It's just your job to pick it up.

John Rogers: So if you wanna… when you get your final, I'm sure you could watch the recordings, start it right now.

John Rogers: And he'll be fine.

John Rogers: And just watch every lecture. You'll be fine.

John Rogers: I don't know if that includes my review sessions on Saturdays.

John Rogers: One student said that they did not get the video recording.

John Rogers: Did, did you all get it?

John Rogers: Saturday?

Clarissa Terrazas: Sir, we can only hear your voice. I don't see your screen.

John Rogers: Really?

Clarissa Terrazas: Yeah… I don't know if it's just me.

Fatima Razavi: I see his face.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: I see you, Professor.

John Rogers: You could see… could you see the screen with the essay?

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: Oh, no, I only see you. There's no screen.

John Rogers: Well, then what's the problem if you see me?

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: I never said it was a problem.

John Rogers: No, I'm kidding. So you can't see the screen? Well, I mean, maybe you can follow along with the essay?

John Rogers: I don't know what to do. I didn't know it didn't record my screen.

John Rogers: Did the other sessions… did it record my screen?

Clarissa Terrazas: Yes.

John Rogers: It did.

John Rogers: I don't know what to tell you. I'm sorry? I don't know, I don't… I just pressed buttons.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: It was the link in the Dropbox, right? Yeah. That you did?

John Rogers: I don't know how to fix that.

John Rogers: I'll do my best to try to fix it moving forward.

Sennett Devermont: I think you might have grabbed the transcript, or the audio-only file, instead of the video and audio.

Sennett Devermont: Mostly control.

John Rogers: You can't… you can only hear me then?

Sennett Devermont: Yeah, not now, but in the recording that you uploaded in Dropbox, yeah, it's your audio only.

Sennett Devermont: It might still be in your Zoom, saved, and then possibly.

John Rogers: Okay, I'll look at that after class, just someone send me a reminder text, okay?

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: I just reopened it, by the way it was. I just reopened that Dropbox, like, it works.

Sennett Devermont: But his video's not there. His photo… you don't see him or his screen, do you?

John Rogers: I mean, you gotta see me. I mean, I'm… I'm the show. You gotta see my face.

Clarissa Terrazas: No, I just hear your audio, Professor.

John Rogers: I mean, it's… at least it's… I have a really nice voice, too, but, I mean, you still can't see the essay that I'm going over.

John Rogers: I will figure it out later.

John Rogers: I don't know what to… what to tell you guys, I'll figure it out later.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Can anyone tell me where I left off last week?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Constructive after substantial. I think you finished substantial in the thing.

John Rogers: Okay, yeah, there must be some type of significant, thank you, significant or substantial interference of some sort. It's measured objectively, so it's not measured on this particular individual. Assess this individual's

John Rogers: problem And compare that with how a reasonable person under the circumstances, would it interfere with them.

John Rogers: So if there's, like, a moth in the closet, oh no, I hate moths. That's not gonna rise to the level of a substantial interference.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Now, constructive eviction can incorporate habitability issues, so a lot of the times, essays can actually have one issue, but require a separate discussion of habitability, which we'll discuss in a few minutes, or…

John Rogers: Two minutes.

John Rogers: Look for problems.

John Rogers: Are the locks broken? Would you rent an apartment where the locks don't… where the… where the… where the lock is broken?

John Rogers: You would.

John Rogers: You would, okay, so you would still rent it, okay.

John Rogers: There's no heating. There's no gas.

John Rogers: I hate cold showers! I need hot water. I need hot water. Maybe there's roach problems. Rodents?

John Rogers: Leaks.

John Rogers: Electrical issues.

John Rogers: Many things. Noise complaints, noise issues.

John Rogers: So look for the tenant having a problem.

John Rogers: Now, this is constructive eviction, so the landlord isn't physically ousting the tenant.

John Rogers: It's just the tenant feels that they're constructive, they have to leave on their own based on the landlord's omission.

John Rogers: So they're constructively being evicted.

John Rogers: The second element is notice to the landlord. So there's a requirement of the tenant to provide the landlord notice of the issue.

John Rogers: Because, how is the landlord to know there's an issue if you don't report it to them?

John Rogers: Do they just walk into your home or apartment and just walk around on their own? Yeah, I'm just looking for problems so I can be put on notice? No, you have to put them on notice.

John Rogers: Let them know.

dovenight: First element is problems.

dovenight: They have. And the second element is notice.

John Rogers: Yeah, it's about right. I like it. Yeah, problem, let's just simplify it. What's the problem? Is there a problem? What is it? And does that problem rise to the level of being a substantial interference?

dovenight: Thank you.

John Rogers: The second element is notice to the landlord. So, did the landlord have notice of the issue?

John Rogers: At the same time, the tenant must, give the landlord a reasonable amount of time to cure

John Rogers: the problem.

John Rogers: What is a reasonable amount of time? I guess it just kind of depends on a case-by-case basis. I saw, like, a mouse in my kitchen.

John Rogers: This is an emergency! Now, now, now, now the sky is falling!

John Rogers: Versus, yeah, my toilet's overflowing and it won't stop. And yeah, there's water coming out, like, you know, I'm just walking in puddles in my apartment.

John Rogers: Which is different. So one is immediate, one is not so immediate.

John Rogers: But the landlord must be given a reasonable amount of time to cure the problem.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Failure to give notice won't succeed in constructive eviction, because how is the landlord to cure an issue if the landlord doesn't know about it?

John Rogers: The third is vacate. The tenant Must. Vacate.

John Rogers: Must leave. You're gone. You are not physically there anymore.

John Rogers: You can't claim that you were evicted if you are still here.

John Rogers: You didn't go anywhere.

John Rogers: The rationale is that you were forced to leave based on the landlord's omissions.

John Rogers: But if you're still there, And you weren't evicted.

John Rogers: Can't claim constructive eviction If the tenant does not vacate.

John Rogers: Usually, these are very minor issues. I don't know, for some reason, a lot of students write, like, big, big paragraphs on vacate.

John Rogers: Why?

John Rogers: we, you know, I'm putting a campaign together, the Save Inc.

John Rogers: Save ink.

John Rogers: Save ink.

John Rogers: And that is what is required for constructive eviction.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: I think you'd be so much better if you were on.

Fatima Razavi: Sorry, sorry, sorry. Can you explain again vacant premises again? I'm not…

John Rogers: AK?

Fatima Razavi: Yes, please.

John Rogers: Leave. You're not there.

Fatima Razavi: I leave because I want to leave, or because you are kicking me out, or is it because there's a mouse, and I'm leaving? I've given you the notice, and now I'm leaving.

John Rogers: That as long as you are gone, there you go.

John Rogers: But if you are still there, can't claim constructive eviction because you were never evicted. You're still there.

John Rogers: How bad is this problem if you're still there?

Fatima Razavi: What if you have nowhere else to go?

John Rogers: There's shelters.

John Rogers: There's a park bench,

John Rogers: In West LA, they have really, soft bushes. You could probably kind of put a sleeping bag in there, too.

Fatima Razavi: So the tenant has to go on their terms and leave. It's not the landlord kicking them out.

John Rogers: If the landlord kicks them out, then that's actual eviction.

John Rogers: Because the landlord is physically ousting them.

John Rogers: This, the tenant is leaving on their own based on the landlord's omissions.

John Rogers: I can't live like this.

John Rogers: They delete.

John Rogers: Nobody can live like this.

Fatima Razavi: what if you came back and saw that… because this… my friend was telling me a story that happened to… it's like, she had someone live with them, like a nanny, and then the nanny was stealing from them, and she said they were trying to kick her out, and I guess it was getting close to the 30,

Fatima Razavi: 30-day mark. And so, when the girl came back home, there was no bed.

John Rogers: God, I like this nanny.

Fatima Razavi: So there was no bed, no, the owners of the home took out the bed, took out the carpet, to basically tell her she's not welcome.

Fatima Razavi: So then the tenant left. Would that be a vacant premises based on the tenant, or would it be considered the landlord kicked her out? I just want to understand.

John Rogers: First off, it sounds like the landlord is using self-help remedies, which is not.

John Rogers: Proper.

John Rogers: Landlord, it's a big no-no.

John Rogers: But it sounds like the landlord is physically ousting them, so evicting them.

Fatima Razavi: Got it. Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: Yes.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, if the… if the notice is given, but the tenant leaves prematurely, Would that still be…

Gevorg Kulikyan: Constructive eviction, or would that be, like, a abandonment situation?

John Rogers: So, the tenant does not allow a reasonable amount of time?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, kind of like the mouse situation, if they leave after 2 days because the landlord can't find the mouse.

John Rogers: Get a snake. I just put a rattlesnake in their… in their place. I let the rattlesnake kill the… kill the rat.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, no, I'm saying, like, the landlord is actually making an effort to solve the problem, they just haven't solved the problem yet.

John Rogers: Okay.

Gevorg Kulikyan: And the tenant leaves.

John Rogers: The law I'm providing you is allowing a reasonable amount of time for the landlord to cure the problem.

John Rogers: That's what I'm doing.

John Rogers: If the tenant does not allow that reasonable amount of time, then they can't succeed to their constructive eviction claim.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So the problem needs to be cured, not attempted to be cured.

John Rogers: I got rats and, in my Venice Beach Apartment.

John Rogers: Old time.

John Rogers: the landlord… tries…

John Rogers: I'll give him or her that. I mean, they tried.

John Rogers: But that's… there's still a rat problem.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So, you left right now.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Would that have been a reasonable amount of time?

John Rogers: Well, you tell me, I don't know.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So that's what would be argued.

John Rogers: Sure, yeah, absolutely.

John Rogers: Did the tenant give the landlord a reasonable amount of time to cure the problem? So, if there's a rat problem, if I was a landlord, I would just put a bunch of rattlesnakes in the apartment, and then just let them deal with it. And if the tenant gets bit, that's their problem.

dovenight: They tend to get bit.

John Rogers: I love rattlesnakes, don't you?

John Rogers: Any other questions?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: eviction, I believe what is next is…

John Rogers: habitability, right? Warrantied habitability, am I mistaken, or…

Sennett Devermont: Illegal.

Mireya Gonzalez: It was legal, yeah, there you go.

John Rogers: Okay, an illegal lease.

John Rogers: It's based on when the lease Is in violation of… the housing code?

John Rogers: at the initial beginning of the lease. So, if the lease is, for example, if… the city issues…

John Rogers: A…

John Rogers: An order to a landlord that says that this place is not habitable, you can't rent this out.

John Rogers: And the landlord rents out the building or apartments within the building anyways.

John Rogers: That is in violation.

John Rogers: So, the lease… is illegal.

John Rogers: And if it's premised on an illegal lease, it's unenforceable.

John Rogers: Does that make sense?

John Rogers: But if the… issue arose After the inception of the lease.

John Rogers: Then the initial lease is not based on anything illegal, so it would not apply.

John Rogers: Does that make sense?

dovenight: Arose after the initiation of the lease.

dovenight: So they start the lease, and then it's announcing the lease is illegal.

John Rogers: Well, if… What is transpiring is after the fact, then the lease Is, still enforceable.

John Rogers: Because the lease itself Was not illegal at its inception.

John Rogers: For example… I want to rent your apartment in Venice Beach.

John Rogers: I like to cook meth.

John Rogers: I do.

John Rogers: I think I have a black belt in it. Anyways… You rent me your apartment?

John Rogers: For the purposes of me cooking meth.

John Rogers: Oh, it ain't bad. That's a pretty good idea. No, that's gonna be illegal. Meth is illegal. Cooking meth is very, very illegal.

John Rogers: or, I want to rent your apartment because I want to have a prostitution ring going on.

John Rogers: Sure, so the lease is built on a prostitution ring, it's an illegal lease, it's unenforceable.

John Rogers: Makes sense.

John Rogers: Same can be true if there… there just has to be some type of housing code violation.

John Rogers: Okay? At its inception.

John Rogers: Not what happened after the fact.

John Rogers: Judge Verastigi has a question.

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes, so…

John Rogers: Oh, you're not wearing your glasses? I'm not. I have them, but I'm not today.

John Rogers: Okay.

Mireya Gonzalez: I had a question in regards to illegal lease, because…

Mireya Gonzalez: You said if the issue arose after, it would not apply. So, in the scenario that you gave us of…

Mireya Gonzalez: that… of the code not letting the tenant live in the apartment because it was inhabitable.

Mireya Gonzalez: how… like, where would you go then if the issue arose and it doesn't apply, but you're not allowed to live in the apartment because of the code that got issued after? What happens then?

John Rogers: Okay, then you would… we'll get to that, but it could be a habitability issue.

John Rogers: It's not deemed habitable, so the law will excuse me from having to pay you for the rent, because this is not habitable.

Mireya Gonzalez: Thank you, that makes sense.

Mireya Gonzalez: I'll wait.

dovenight: So, if you rent an apartment in Malibu, and everything is fine, then after you rent it,

dovenight: He started, you know, a prostitution ring.

dovenight: Then… Or… Then… then it's a legal lease?

John Rogers: As long as it's based on that.

John Rogers: The lease is based on illegal prostitution.

John Rogers: Yes, I'm selling you… I'm renting this to you for the sole purpose of running a prostitution ring, or a mess.

Sennett Devermont: But if just the tenant is gonna do the prostitution ring without telling the landlord, then it's not an illegal lease.

John Rogers: There's no meeting of the minds.

John Rogers: This gets very technical, and it does exist, especially in…

John Rogers: The county, when you have, like, marijuana smoke shops or marijuana medical dispensaries?

John Rogers: That, were leased out.

John Rogers: It's commercial, but doesn't matter.

John Rogers: Is that an illegal lease?

John Rogers: So, there was litigation on that, I haven't followed, don't really care, to be honest, but,

John Rogers: I'm sure that if you're interested, you could probably find some law on it.

John Rogers: Questions so far?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Retaliatory eviction or habitability?

John Rogers: I think it's re… .

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Habitability.

John Rogers: Habitability, okay. Warranty of habitability. Very, very, very commonly tested. Very commonly tested, just like constructive eviction.

John Rogers: Very commonly tested. Very commonly tested.

John Rogers: But… the discussion… is… Can be different from constructive eviction, because it's dealing with habitability issues.

John Rogers: So, some of you that wrote an essay to me about a broken elevator, Is a broken elevator habitability?

John Rogers: Versus, there's mold.

John Rogers: Versus there's rats.

John Rogers: Versus… The toilet doesn't flush, so just kind of use the kitchen sink a little bit.

John Rogers: There's no hot water or electricity, but, I mean, I have a 6-pack of Duracell batteries if you want some.

John Rogers: What is raising habitability?

John Rogers: Habitability.

John Rogers: Is this place habitable?

John Rogers: for ordinary residential use. Habitability does not apply, and you should bold underline, or do whatever it is, just, you know.

John Rogers: put highlighter on your screen. For…

John Rogers: It does not apply in commercial leases.

John Rogers: It only applies in residential leases.

John Rogers: So, if a business is complaining about a habitability issue in a commercial commercial lease.

John Rogers: They can complain all they want.

John Rogers: But they are not entitled to seek relief under the implied Warranty of habitability.

John Rogers: Now, it's implied

John Rogers: Okay? Which means that it doesn't have to be in writing. There's nothing in… that is required to be in writing.

John Rogers: For the landlord's obligation to provide a habitable lease.

John Rogers: Similarly, the landlord cannot waive… the landlord cannot waive… habitability issue.

John Rogers: underline that.

John Rogers: That's a problem.

John Rogers: So ask yourself, Is this premises suitable

John Rogers: For reasonable, ordinary, residential use.

John Rogers: Yes.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: So if this came up in a commercial property.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: situation, would you bring up the talk about word of heavily and just fail it and say it's not applicable here because it's a commercial lease? Or would you… what would you say in that scenario?

John Rogers: Well, for, like, a final exam, are you asking?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Correct.

John Rogers: I mean, here's the thing, I would… I'm all about saving energy.

John Rogers: And when I mean energy, I mean pixels on a screen.

John Rogers: So, if it's a commercial lease, for the purposes of my exam, you don't need to talk about it if it's commercial. You can just leave it blank. But, if you want to be…

John Rogers: you know, safe.

John Rogers: If I'm scared, I gotta write something, because I'm scared! That's okay, too, you can…

John Rogers: You can write it. You'll never lose points for things you don't need.

John Rogers: You know, if you want to write about, you know, eating… Oranges in,

John Rogers: South Africa, go ahead, I don't care.

John Rogers: Not gonna lose points.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Last question I have is also, what do you mean by it cannot be waived due to public policy? That's if it's in a residential situation, it can't be waived?

John Rogers: Can I be waived.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: It's what has to be…

John Rogers: It's implied in every residential lease.

John Rogers: Period. Not getting around. You cannot lease a premises to people.

John Rogers: With it being uninhabitable.

John Rogers: If the premises is uninhabitable, in a residential lease.

John Rogers: This excuses the tenant from paying the landlord.

John Rogers: And there's no requirement that the tenant vacate.

John Rogers: This premises could be uninhabitable, And I'm still here!

John Rogers: I'm still here!

John Rogers: Which means I don't have to vacate.

dovenight: So, the landlord cannot waive the habitable rights.

dovenight: And it excuses the tendon from pain if it's uninhabitable, and…

dovenight: The tenant have the right if they choose to leave, right?

John Rogers: The tenant could leave, the tenant could stay?

John Rogers: Whenever the tenant wants to.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: I like this, though.

John Rogers: When I read finals, a lot of students fall on their face for this.

John Rogers: Oh, it's warranty of habitability! Oh, totally got it! I'm so happy! I'm gonna get an A-plus on property, that was easy.

John Rogers: There's a substandard discussion, usually.

John Rogers: Oh, there's rats in the apartment! Gave notice to the landlord, bye. You didn't say how rats in the apartment is a habitability issue, and how it affects the entire premises to deem this entire premises uninhabitable.

John Rogers: So… I think, on a few… A few years ago?

John Rogers: There were wires hanging from a ceiling.

John Rogers: The issue, though, is it didn't actually say that they were live wires.

John Rogers: But… How,

John Rogers: it doesn't say that they were live wires, but if it's, for example, in a guest bedroom, how does that deem the entire premises uninhabitable? No one can live here.

John Rogers: If it's a 3-bedroom home and one of the toilets doesn't work, is this premises uninhabitable?

John Rogers: Or you could use the other two toilets.

John Rogers: Or the shower, the sink, whatever you want to do.

John Rogers: So how is the premises uninhabitable? So, if there is, like, a mold issue, for example.

John Rogers: And the tenant complains, and maybe it's toxic mold, and the tenant is complaining, and vacates, and the landlord never did anything.

John Rogers: Two issues could arise, constructive eviction, as well as implied warrantied habitability.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: But, for example, if the question says, a broken elevator, And… mold.

John Rogers: You don't say broken elevator for implied warranty of habitability.

John Rogers: You'd save that for constructive eviction.

John Rogers: For warrantied habitability, you'd want to address what raises the habitability of sanitary issues, which would be the mold.

John Rogers: Rats.

John Rogers: Judge Verastiki.

Mireya Gonzalez: So, in other words, you can have constructive eviction without having to discuss warranty of inhabitability.

John Rogers: Yes, 100%.

John Rogers: But sometimes it also coincides with it.

John Rogers: So a lot of the students, historically, write constructive ediction, and they write, like, a lot about it, and then they get to implied warranty of habitability and say.

John Rogers: Same as above, bye! So just be very careful, because it's a slight different discussion there.

John Rogers: There's 2 more hands up.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Okay, I have a question in… for example, let's say the mold example that you gave.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Let's say it's, two-bed, one bath, and one of the bathrooms is mold.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Okay, so… So first, the tenant would have to prove that it's mold.

John Rogers: themselves, right? They can't just say, hey, there's mold in my bathroom, and then…

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Have the landlord come and, like, confirm it, or do they have to prove that there is actual mold, and send that prove as notice to the landlord?

John Rogers: Great question.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Or is that, like, too… like, not a tested area?

John Rogers: I kind of tested it before.

John Rogers: I didn't like it because it required, kind of like, proof.

John Rogers: I didn't… Proving something up.

John Rogers: I don't like doing that.

John Rogers: I'd rather just… just say it's mold, and let you decide.

John Rogers: If it potentially is toxic, or is it, you know, typical mold that you have?

John Rogers: You know.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: But in a real-world, like, scenario, they would have to prove that, hey, it's toxic mold, and this is the notice that I have toxic mold.

John Rogers: I mean, you have mold on your pillow.

John Rogers: I have mold on my pillow. Yeah.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yeah, but it's not toxic.

John Rogers: Yes, so there you go, it's not toxic. You'd have to prove it was… Right. In the practicing world, you'd have to prove that it's damaging of some sort.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: Yes.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, just to understand the habitability situation, so like the elevator, Just an elevator alone doesn't…

Gevorg Kulikyan: kind of make the habitability less in a premises, but let's say the facts say that the person can't access their

Gevorg Kulikyan: house because… or their apartment because of the elevator. At that point, it would be a habitability issue, correct?

John Rogers: Potentially, yeah, but how could they not access it?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Let's say they're on a wheelchair.

Gevorg Kulikyan: They can only go up to the third floor.

Gevorg Kulikyan: With the wheel, with the elevator.

John Rogers: Use their arms and climb.

John Rogers: Yeah, in that case, yeah, it potentially is a habitability issue, sure. There is California law that says that broken locks

John Rogers: Constant a habitability issue.

John Rogers: I didn't research any further than that, but yeah, technically speaking, yes, I could. But I just… you want to look for more…

John Rogers: annoyance, substantial interference that are looked to be annoyances versus sanitary issues. But yes, technically, yes, you're right.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Thank you.

Fatima Razavi: A professor, in an essay, so if we have implied warranty of habitability, we see that the location… that area is not, you know.

Fatima Razavi: livable. Then what?

Fatima Razavi: What do we write in the essay? Do we say that the tenant chooses to live there, and the landlord wanted to kick them out? Like, the landlord doesn't want to do anything with it? I mean, what is the point of us, right? What do we write in.

John Rogers: How is it a habitability issue? How does it affect the entire premises to deem this uninhabitable, to excuse this person from paying rent?

Fatima Razavi: Okay, to excuse them from paying rent?

John Rogers: Yeah, how is this unlivable?

John Rogers: How is this that the tenant should then just start being protected?

John Rogers: And is it objective, too?

Fatima Razavi: This place is not habitable because I saw a moth.

John Rogers: I say moths because my older sister, when I was growing up, like, didn't like moths.

Fatima Razavi: And how long will they be able to live like that?

Fatima Razavi: So, the landlord owns this land, and it's not habitable, At what point…

Fatima Razavi: do they cross paths again? And he's like, okay, you gotta get out.

John Rogers: Well, it could be a she, but,

John Rogers: What do you mean, crawl past again? Like, hold on, what do you mean?

Fatima Razavi: Like, the landlord is like, okay, buddy, you gotta get out. You're just kind of freeloading on this land. You're saying it's not habitable, you don't want to pay rent.

John Rogers: And a landlord is going to sue for unpaid rent, and the tenant is going to fire back and say it's not habitable, so I don't have to pay any rent.

Fatima Razavi: And then someone's gonna say, well, if it's not habitable, then get out.

John Rogers: I have nowhere to go.

Fatima Razavi: So you're just gonna just live there? I mean, I just want to understand how do I go about this in my essay? So I'm gonna say this person is living there.

Fatima Razavi: It's not habitable, and so he's not gonna pay rent.

Fatima Razavi: To the landlord, so then that's it, and I just leave it?

John Rogers: No, I mean, I don't know what you're asking exactly.

Fatima Razavi: I'm not understanding how to write this in an essay, like, what exactly… do we just bring it up and say, and also this, like, place is not habitable?

Fatima Razavi: And based on these factors.

John Rogers: Okay, let me ask you this.

Fatima Razavi: Okay.

John Rogers: If I were to say the toilet is sometimes not working properly.

John Rogers: Is that a sanitary issue, deeming this entire premises uninhabitable, to excuse the tenant from paying rent?

Fatima Razavi: No, well, it depends. Are there more other bathrooms?

John Rogers: One bedroom place. One bedroom place. One toilet.

Fatima Razavi: So, no, it's not. I wouldn't say it's admable.

John Rogers: You're saying it's not a habitable premises.

Fatima Razavi: Yes.

John Rogers: Because the toilet sometimes does not work properly.

Fatima Razavi: Exactly.

John Rogers: What does work properly even mean?

John Rogers: And what is sometimes?

Fatima Razavi: The frequency, I guess, is something you would have to determine if it's, like, an hourly issue, or does it happen once a month?

John Rogers: But does it say it doesn't flush?

Fatima Razavi: No.

John Rogers: So, you should tell me… That that is a vague situation, and a vague statement.

John Rogers: So you have to tell me whether you think that rises to the level of being uninhabitable to excuse the tenant from paying rent, that no person should be able to be obligated to pay rent, because this premises is uninhabitable to a reasonable person.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, got it. Thank you.

John Rogers: Yeah.

dovenight: Okay, so, Leno can't wave habitable rides, and the place is uninhabitable.

dovenight: Excuse the tenant for playing the landlord, and the tenant can leave and excuse the tenant whether they have a choice to leave or not.

John Rogers: I think you're right.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

Mireya Gonzalez: I have a question. When you say the entire premises, you mean, like, that apartment itself, or the entire premises of the entire apartment complex?

John Rogers: how much did you paint it. So, if you're renting a place in… Santa Monica.

John Rogers: Are you paying for the entire complex, or are you paying for just one unit?

Mireya Gonzalez: Just unmute it.

Mireya Gonzalez: Got you. Thank you.

John Rogers: I had a student, like, 10 years ago. She calls me up.

John Rogers: She lived in Marina Del Rey, and she was telling me that every night the fire alarm keeps going off in her complex.

John Rogers: Causing everyone to have to get up and… Exit.

John Rogers: And it would go off for, like, 45 minutes at, like, 2.45 in the morning.

John Rogers: She says, you know, is this habitability or a constructive eviction claim? I was like, hmm, that's very interesting.

John Rogers: Never tested on something like that before, but, thought that'd be very interesting.

John Rogers: Is this premises habitable if someone can't get proper sleep at night?

John Rogers: Is a fire alarm going off for 45 minutes every night.

John Rogers: a substantial interference.

John Rogers: Yes.

Sennett Devermont: You have here, like, number 1, refuse to pay rent, and then number 2 says, remedy the defect and offset the cost against the rent.

Sennett Devermont: And then 3 is defend against eviction, but could… number… Kinda confused on number 2.

John Rogers: S- what did I say?

Sennett Devermont: So, one is refuse to pay rent, and number two, if that makes sense. Two is remedy the defect and offset the cost against the rent.

John Rogers: Okay, so if, if, for example, there's mold.

John Rogers: And I pay… how much… I live…

John Rogers: If I live in a one-bedroom in Santa Monica, nice place. How much am I paying? How much am I paying?

Sennett Devermont: 5,000.

John Rogers: You know, we said that before, 5… are you sure \$5,000 for one bedroom in Santa Monica?

Isabella Salahshoor: Thousand.

John Rogers: \$6,000?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: To the ocean, probably, if you're a little.

dovenight: Not even.

Isabella Salahshoor: a 3rd Street Promenade-like area.

Isabella Salahshoor: Insane.

John Rogers: \$6,000… I'm gonna look this up.

John Rogers: I'm gonna look it up.

John Rogers: But, okay, if it's 5,000 bucks.

John Rogers: And I got mold in my \$5,000 place, and I'm paying \$5,000 a month to have a \$5,000 apartment.

John Rogers: And there's mold in my \$5,000 apartment.

John Rogers: And it's gonna cost \$1,000 To get rid of this mold.

John Rogers: Then, if I do that, I pay the cost myself, I get it done, I could then, the following month, only pay the landlord \$4,000 a month.

Sennett Devermont: Well, why would you do that if your number one says refuse to pay rent, and you're not paying anything?

John Rogers: Sure, you don't have to if you don't want to.

Sennett Devermont: So you could offset, or you pay nothing, but it's just…

John Rogers: Whatever the tenant elects to do.

John Rogers: \$6,000? 6,000? 6,000 bucks?

John Rogers: For one bedroom.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Thanks for watching.

John Rogers: Is it a studio one-bedroom, or, like, a one-bedroom one-bedroom?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: One bedroom.

John Rogers: One bedroom? So you have a door you close.

John Rogers: In that separate room.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: That's why we're trying to become attorneys, we want to live by… by the beach.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Made the big bucks, hopefully.

John Rogers: Yeah, I live by the beach.

John Rogers: Wow, I'm gonna look that up.

John Rogers: Does that make sense? Does that answer your question?

Sennett Devermont: Yep.

John Rogers: How much would it be to… a nice place in Hollywood, then? How much is a nice one-bedroom in Hollywood?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: 3,500.

John Rogers: It's a nice place in Hollywood.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Yeah.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: 4,000 and 3,500?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Depends on the size, also.

dovenight: I'm not interested in the bad area of Hollywood.

Sennett Devermont: Orange and Hollywood, the Madison Apartments is \$2,500 for a one-bedroom.

Sennett Devermont: And that's, like, got a nice view, too, so that's kind of in Hollywood.

John Rogers: Oh, okay.

John Rogers: I don't… Curious.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: I used to live in Santa Monica.

John Rogers: I had a 3-bedroom place with, like, 30-foot ceilings and a deck on the roof.

John Rogers: 3 bedrooms, marble floors.

John Rogers: I lived there for years, I only paid.

John Rogers: \$14.90 a month for it.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Rent-controlled, though.

John Rogers: Rent control.

John Rogers: Honestly, I'd probably still be living there.

John Rogers: I'd probably… I'd probably still live there, to be honest. It was a rad place, too.

John Rogers: Very cool place.

John Rogers: Ugh.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I know someone that has an apartment like that, and they just handed it off to the next person, the next person.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Because the rent was so low, and the landlord doesn't say anything. They don't even know… doesn't even know someone else is living in there.

John Rogers: Yeah, and it was funny, because my neighbor…

John Rogers: was a soon-to-be student of mine. I didn't even know.

John Rogers: Any questions before we move on?

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Very commonly tested, warranty of habitability, implied warranty of habitability. It does not have to be in writing, it's implied in every single residential lease.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Where the landlord promises, implying, that they are providing a habitable premises

John Rogers: Now we get to retaliatory eviction.

John Rogers: This occurs when the landlord is responding, has some type of retaliatory response against the tenant for reporting an issue.

John Rogers: So, for example, If there's constant mold on the… on the premises.

John Rogers: And the tenant reports that to…

John Rogers: the city.

John Rogers: As being an issue, constant violations, and the city gets involved, and then the landlord discovers that, and the landlord then raises the rent as a result of that.

John Rogers: Then the landlord is retaliating against the tenant.

John Rogers: Because the landlord is punishing the tenant.

John Rogers: But the law wants tenants to report things.

John Rogers: report problems.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, look for the tenant reporting something.

John Rogers: And as a consequence to that reporting, the landlord punishes the tenant Because of that.

John Rogers: There are certain presumptions that apply.

John Rogers: Okay, presumptions. So, for example, if the tenant were to, report a violation.

John Rogers: to them.

John Rogers: To the city, or to whomever.

John Rogers: And the landlord, and I apologize, guys, it's in my notes, I'm not sure if it's 120 or 180, I seem to think it's 120 days.

John Rogers: But, could be 180, I can't remember. If the landlord moves to increase the rent within that

John Rogers: maybe it's 180. It's in my notes. Within that certain time period, it's a presumption that it's retaliatory then. So, the presumption applies.

John Rogers: So, if the tenant were to,

John Rogers: 90 to 180, thank you so much.

John Rogers: 90 to 180, okay, not 120.

John Rogers: So, there is a presumption that applies.

John Rogers: And, it doesn't mean that the presumption is valid, or it's standing. It can always be rebutted, but there's that presumption

John Rogers: That applies.

John Rogers: That the landlord acted retaliatory.

John Rogers: Makes sense.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: What if it's before 90 days? Does 90 to 180? It can't be from 0 to 180 days after?

John Rogers: Like, the minute you report it… I think what I meant was, like, 0 to 90, or 0 to 180, I think it was.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Okay.

John Rogers: Because some jurisdictions say 90 within 90 days, or some jurisdictions say up to 180.

John Rogers: I… I… I believe it's,

John Rogers: 180 is depending upon what jurisdiction it would apply to.

John Rogers: Any questions?

Amir Akbari: Could it… Could it be something like,

Amir Akbari: not 3DL for the new… is it…

Amir Akbari: For the new lease agreement? Is it, like, a punishment, or no?

Amir Akbari: Like, after reporting…

John Rogers: It's considered a punishment. It's a punishment. I'm punishing you for reporting this.

Amir Akbari: And I'm not renewing the lease for the next year, right?

Amir Akbari: It's a punishment.

John Rogers: It's a punishment.

John Rogers: Punishment.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

John Rogers: Yes.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, so for an essay, once we find that there is retaliatory eviction, Oh, it's an eviction.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I think I just answered my own question. I was gonna say, like, what happens then? It's just, we just find out there's…

Gevorg Kulikyan: Retaliations, then.

John Rogers: Cancels the lease, get out.

John Rogers: Done.

John Rogers: It's really against public policy to try to, Silence.

John Rogers: Someone who's, who's a whistleblower.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

John Rogers: Okay, no questions.

John Rogers: I forgot you guys are smart.

John Rogers: You guys are good.

John Rogers: I gotta tell the dean about you guys. You guys are smart.

John Rogers: Pictures?

John Rogers: Pictures?

Mireya Gonzalez: Liability.

John Rogers: Tort liability. Tort liability.

John Rogers: Well, I like tort liability because it's torts. It's not property, okay?

John Rogers: I… and I… may be incorrect with, tort liability, to be honest, but this,

John Rogers: This, I believe, is dealing with premise liability, and whether or not

John Rogers: A landlord or the tenant is going to be liable if someone were to be injured.

John Rogers: I don't test on this issue.

John Rogers: Neither does my counterpart.

John Rogers: Because it is torts.

John Rogers: Kind of like if someone comes onto the premise and they're injured, who do they sue, the actual tenant or the landlord? Something you'll learn in torts.

John Rogers: Because someone could be an invitee,

John Rogers: all kinds of stuff. Has anyone taken Torts 2?

John Rogers: None of y'all taking torts, too? Someone has taken torts, too!

Amir Akbari: I did.

John Rogers: You did! When did you learn about invitees and blah blah blah blah blah?

Amir Akbari: Yeah, the promised liability.

John Rogers: The promised land, believe it.

Amir Akbari: When? When? Last… last year.

Andre Hakobyan: less solicit.

John Rogers: industry.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, it's free.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: I will never test on something like this, because half the class has not taken that part.

John Rogers: So you will learn about this in Torts 2. And I like the fact that you will learn it in Torts 2, because I don't have to…

John Rogers: I have to teach it. So, you're gonna learn it all in torts too, alright?

John Rogers: Fixtures? I believe it's fixtures now, right?

John Rogers: Is it fixtures?

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes, it is.

John Rogers: Fixtures is tested. Fixtures is tested.

John Rogers: It's tested, I've tested it a few times.

John Rogers: I have tested it a few times. It does come up on the bar, too.

John Rogers: The question is this.

John Rogers: When?

John Rogers: If you are renting a place.

John Rogers: Could you make certain modifications, or do things on the property that ultimately

John Rogers: That you would potentially lose interest for… over.

John Rogers: To the point where if you… Install something, for example.

John Rogers: Does what you are installing ultimately become part of the realty?

John Rogers: So, if you're renting, a home.

John Rogers: And you, change the water heater. You buy a whole new one, you get it installed, blah blah blah.

John Rogers: Does that water heater become part of the realty, making it now the landlord's?

John Rogers: you… put in wallpaper. You take that wallpaper with you, or is that actually part of the realty?

Sarah Downs: Doesn't it depend on… How severe it is to take it off?

John Rogers: Excuse me?

Sarah Downs: Doesn't it depend on how severe it is to remove it?

John Rogers: Yeah, it kinda does.

John Rogers: It's actually gone to the lengths of, does a chandelier A really, really big chandelier.

John Rogers: Become part of the realty.

John Rogers: Did… so you want to ask yourself.

John Rogers: There is a chattel of some sort.

John Rogers: That is becoming affixed to the property.

John Rogers: And did the tenant intend for that chattel to become part of the realty?

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: carpet.

John Rogers: I move into a new house, I'm putting all new carpet in. But wait a second.

John Rogers: Is that part of the realty, and did you intend for that to attach to the realty? If so, that's the landlord's. You can't take the carpet with you. I'm really sorry.

John Rogers: Wallpaper.

John Rogers: carpet.

John Rogers: But what about, like, a couch.

John Rogers: A couch is not going to be affixed to the property, though, right?

John Rogers: I've gotten creative with this.

John Rogers: What my… My friend bought a house a few years ago.

John Rogers: And I went over, and I got this idea one time, and I went over, he gave me a tour.

John Rogers: And I walk into his bathroom.

John Rogers: And I said, what is that thing?

John Rogers: And it gave… just gave me the idea, because I thought it was cool.

John Rogers: He's like, that's my Japanese toilet.

John Rogers: And I said, what's a Japanese toilet? He says, I bought it for 8 grand.

John Rogers: I said, you bought an \$8,000 toilet?

John Rogers: And he showed me all the gadgets and lights and all kinds of stuff on that. I was like, what?

John Rogers: That's so cool! Anyways… I made that a final exam.

John Rogers: So, is installing a toilet… Does that become… a fixture.

John Rogers: Making it now the landlord's property, once the tenant vacates.

John Rogers: Well, is it affixed to the property?

John Rogers: Certainly the plumbing is, right?

John Rogers: Bolted down, right?

John Rogers: And that I intend that it attach to the property.

John Rogers: Well, I don't usually carry around a mobile toilet, but I should. I should probably maybe keep one in my briefcase, take it to court, you know?

John Rogers: Where's your bathroom? I usually keep it in the cupboard. You can take it out if you want.

John Rogers: Yeah, come on over to my house.

John Rogers: Anyways, the toilet is now affixed. So, the question becomes is…

John Rogers: is that toilet now a fixture, making it the landlord? So if the tenant rolls in, I rent this place, I love this apartment in Santa Monica, I pay \$6,000, it's so lovely. And once I move in, I get rid of this toilet, and I bring in a brand new, high-tech Japanese toilet. I wonder if anyone's looking it up right now.

John Rogers: And now I install it, and make it part of the realty.

John Rogers: If I move out later on, after my lease expires, and I found an even better place for \$7,000, because I need to pay more money, can I take the toilet with me?

John Rogers: Or, is that toilet?

John Rogers: the landlords.

John Rogers: Yes.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: What if we just replace it with a \$100 toilet and take my toilet with me?

John Rogers: Sure. Yeah, you can probably do that, but… For exam purposes.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Could we say that, though?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: If you brought it.

John Rogers: You know, I mean, I said that in the exam. I said the tenant replaced the toilet with a new high-tech toilet, and then upon moving out.

John Rogers: put the old toilet there. I don't know the answer. No clue what the answer was. Just want to see what everyone said.

John Rogers: I still think the Japanese toilet belongs to the landlord. I'm sorry. I still think the toilet belongs to the landlord.

John Rogers: But, you can go either direction.

John Rogers: What about…

John Rogers: Roses.

John Rogers: Like, if I rent a home.

John Rogers: And I grow roses and flowers.

John Rogers: Are those roses and flowers affixed to the realty, and I intend for them to be part of the realty? If so, I might not be able to take my roses with me when I vacate.

John Rogers: That's why I have to use POTS.

Amir Akbari: But it should be attached to the structure, right?

John Rogers: The structure of the land itself.

John Rogers: the structure?

John Rogers: the structure.

John Rogers: I don't think it requires the structure.

John Rogers: I don't… think it's actually… Required as to be in the structure.

John Rogers: I don't think so.

John Rogers: It typically is.

John Rogers: Because there's a roof over your head, but I'm getting creative insofar as…

John Rogers: Outside, but still on the realty.

John Rogers: I think last year or two years ago, What about a security system?

John Rogers: You want to think of the channel itself, too. Is a security system typically something that is transient? That what you install, you just take with you to the next place, to the next place? Or, last year, I also… year the year before, I think I tested on,

John Rogers: Solar panels.

John Rogers: Installing solar panels on the side of someone's house.

John Rogers: Is that a fixture now? Yes, hand raised, yes.

dovenight: So you can argue either way. You can say, yes, it's part of the realtor, because the Japanese toilet and the solar panels.

dovenight: became part of the realty, because it's fixed, it's attached. Or you could say.

dovenight: Oh, no, it's not a part of Realty, so the tenant leaves, they can uninstall that and take it with them and just replace it with…

John Rogers: Yeah, but is a toilet typically transient? Do you typically take toilets with you?

dovenight: No.

John Rogers: So it's like… It's a difficult counter-argument, but,

John Rogers: I'm sure you can get creative.

John Rogers: Like… I mean, there's, like, bidets too, right?

John Rogers: I mean, that's not… There's portable ones, I think you can buy.

John Rogers: A rose garden.

John Rogers: Solar panels.

John Rogers: Those typically transient things, or like even carpet, wallpaper.

John Rogers: Oh, yeah, I usually just take the carpet with me. Just pull it out.

John Rogers: I love doing that.

John Rogers: They're all… there's also… There's also, trade fixtures as well.

John Rogers: which I don't think is included in my notes, but trait fixtures are more, with… commercial leases.

John Rogers: So, if I have a warehouse.

John Rogers: And I need to, manufacture widgets. What's a widget? Yeah, no, it's fictional.

John Rogers: I have to manufacture something, I might have to install machinery in this warehouse that requires me to manufacture

John Rogers: A widget of some sort.

John Rogers: So the law makes a difference of…

John Rogers: Trade fixtures, because this type of operation may just be transient.

John Rogers: If we move, we're taking the machinery and everything that we incorporated into the realty with us, so that we can move this manufacturing operation somewhere else.

John Rogers: But there is a requirement that the fixture for, like, for example, trade fixtures, are removed upon termination of the lease.

John Rogers: And that, the trade… the fixtures do not damage the realty.

John Rogers: any significant damage to the realty. I don't know if it's actually in my notes, is it? Trade fixtures?

Isabella Salahshoor: You have an annexed… Chattel?

John Rogers: Okay.

Isabella Salahshoor: We don't have trade fixtures.

John Rogers: Trade pictures.

Sennett Devermont: Is it on the test?

John Rogers: No. I, well, I mean, no.

John Rogers: No, it's not on your test.

John Rogers: Trade fixtures can be transient, because it's, it's, it's focused on,

John Rogers: commercial only, though. It's not, like, residential.

John Rogers: 749.

John Rogers: Do you guys want to take a break now?

John Rogers: 15 minutes, sound good?

dovenight: Yeah.

John Rogers: Alright, let's take a 15-minute break.

Gevorg Kulikyan: He says…

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, can I ask a quick question?

John Rogers: Yeah.

Gevorg Kulikyan: When it says a f…

Gevorg Kulikyan: a fixture that is a shadow that has been affixed and intended to be attached to the property. Is it, like,

Gevorg Kulikyan: The intention comes from what the…

Gevorg Kulikyan: Chaddle actually is, or is it, like, the intention of the tenant when installing?

Gevorg Kulikyan: the channel.

John Rogers: I think it's a combination of both. I mean, if I'm intending to install something.

John Rogers: or if I'm installing something that is just becoming part of the realty, certainly my intentions are that it

John Rogers: Be part of the realty as well.

John Rogers: Good question, though.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, I'm thinking of, like, your friend that… installed the \$8,000 toilet.

John Rogers: 80,000, 8, just to be clear, \$8,000.

Gevorg Kulikyan: \$8,000, \$8,000 toilet. I don't think he intended to gift that to the…

John Rogers: Landlord.

John Rogers: Yes, but the intent is not to make it the landlords, it's the intent to become part of the realty.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Got it.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So, if the landlord Fired.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Your friend would be required to leave the toilet there?

John Rogers: The thing is, is that it's his own house, so, I mean… but, he just installed it, but…

John Rogers: I know you could get sneaky and say, well, he just can never tell, just never tell the landlord, he'll be fine. Sure, I totally get it, and I agree, but it's just not…

John Rogers: You take the facts as they are, and if someone installed a toilet, That's the… that's what happened.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Got it. Don't argue, like, well, the landlord will never know!

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, yeah, no, just… I wanna see what the requirement is. It's like…

Gevorg Kulikyan: I know in real life, this isn't, like, a big issue, because the landlord will most likely never know.

Gevorg Kulikyan: But on, like, testing purposes.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Where if, like, the price of the toilet is mentioned, and there's things like that, I feel like that changes…

Gevorg Kulikyan: kind of… the issue.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Where there's more facts.

Gevorg Kulikyan: No.

John Rogers: Where there are more facts.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, like, the price of the toilet, and… it's…

Gevorg Kulikyan: you can infer that the tenant didn't want to leave that. They're gonna take it with them, and…

Gevorg Kulikyan: Things like that.

Gevorg Kulikyan: But if it's affixed to the…

Gevorg Kulikyan: Property, then they have no choice but to leave it.

John Rogers: Okay.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Does that make sense?

John Rogers: I… Not sure.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I just want to see, like, on an essay, if there are facts like that, where it does mention that it's a high-tech toilet.

Gevorg Kulikyan: And… The tenant clearly does not want to leave the toilet.

Gevorg Kulikyan: But are they required to leave the toilet?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Is that toilet now the landlord's?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Or the properties.

John Rogers: It's now the landlords.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Got it.

Andre Hakobyan: This is a very funky rule.

John Rogers: Excuse me?

Andre Hakobyan: It's a very funky rule, Professor.

Andre Hakobyan: What if… what if you live in a windy area and everything you have?

Andre Hakobyan: for your comfort.

Andre Hakobyan: You have to kind of attach to the ground.

Andre Hakobyan: So the wind doesn't blow it away.

Andre Hakobyan: Does it automatically become the owners? The landlords?

John Rogers: I'm sure that there are exceptions to things like that, but, I mean, when you're talking about carpet, when you're talking about wallpaper, when you're talking about water heater.

John Rogers: Talking about.

John Rogers: Stuff like that, that's part of the realty.

John Rogers: Anything else, guys?

Mireya Gonzalez: I have a… just a quick one. In a case where, like.

Mireya Gonzalez: the landlord had no idea, and then the tenant left, took the toilet, and then started having problems after. Is there rem… like, are you… is there exceptions to that?

John Rogers: Exceptions to something being a fixture?

Mireya Gonzalez: No, like, if they were to take… if…

Mireya Gonzalez: if the fixture were to be removed, and then the tenant already leaves, I guess, can… can the landlord still…

Mireya Gonzalez: sue, I guess, for damages that arose after

Mireya Gonzalez: It was removed, but the other toilet was put back.

John Rogers: Haha, good question.

John Rogers: I think it's a damages issue, so I think that the landlord could sue to actually get the item back, or its replacement, or… and any damages that resulted.

John Rogers: Yes.

dovenight: Well, if it's on the essay, the tenant intent, where they installed a Japanese toilet.

dovenight: And new carpeting is the intent… it's in the facts that the intentions for temporary, to keep, you know, install this until they move, and then they take all that out and replace it.

dovenight: And, the landlord has a dispute with it.

John Rogers: Here's the thing, I think you have to ultimately look at what the album is, too. Like, carpet.

John Rogers: But do people install carpet?

John Rogers: For that carpet to be transient.

John Rogers: I'm not talking about a rug.

John Rogers: Talk about carpet.

John Rogers: Car. Pet.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Wallpaper! Wallpaper? No, I like to take the wallpaper with me!

dovenight: Thank you.

John Rogers: Anything else, guys? Anyone else have any… anyone else have any questions?

John Rogers: God, you know…

John Rogers: I know, like, 75% of this class has just these beautiful voices. Like, the voices are just, like, poems to me. It's like…

John Rogers: You'd die listening to them.

John Rogers: I really wish I heard them more often.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Daniel Sinanian: I have a question.

Daniel Sinanian: So,

Daniel Sinanian: It's related to the essays, so can an essay include both, like, fee simple absolute, the feasible fees, future interest, and adverse possession?

Daniel Sinanian: For one essay?

John Rogers: Hmm.

John Rogers: Absolutely. Happens all done.

maddykoshkaryan: Professor, you said our… Exam's gonna be harder than evidence?

maddykoshkaryan: I'm pretty sad about that.

John Rogers: I don't know, I think this class is harder than Evidence, I think.

John Rogers: What we're learning about right now, no, but I think that generally, I think property in general, I think, is harder than evidence. It's just a different style of thinking.

John Rogers: But… I don't know. Ask me next week.

John Rogers: I'll ponder it, I'll think about it. My Friday night, I'll just sit and dwell on final exams, and

John Rogers: I'll get back to you next Thursday, give you my official opinion.

maddykoshkaryan: Thank you.

John Rogers: I don't think I write hard exams, but I do think that my counterparts do.

John Rogers: Oh.

John Rogers: I just write vague things.

John Rogers: Anything else?

maddykoshkaryan: And your counterparts are the ones writing these, this, exam, or is it gonna be you?

John Rogers: No, I told you, my counterpart wrote your final exam. I did not write a single letter of your final exam.

maddykoshkaryan: Great.

maddykoshkaryan: Thanks.

Mireya Gonzalez: He literally… question.

Mireya Gonzalez: As far… as the fixtures?

Mireya Gonzalez: Actually, never mind. I just said that out loud, or I said it in my head and it does make sense. Sorry about that.

John Rogers: To talk about duty to repair, so the landlord's duty to repair, just, you want to look for if there's damages, the tenant has no obligation to actually

John Rogers: Make, significant, repairs.

John Rogers: At the same time, for… I'm sure you all heard of ordinary wear and tear.

John Rogers: The tenant is not responsible for having to fix any ordinary wear and tear, okay?

John Rogers: So when you see kind of a constructive eviction issue.

John Rogers: When you see maybe a habitability issue.

John Rogers: Sometimes you want to think of this issue, maybe mention it, duty to repair, and say, is this significant to the point where maybe the tenant has to, should repair it?

John Rogers: Anything caused by the tenant, sure.

John Rogers: Duty to repair it.

John Rogers: So, if you're, you know, Throwing knives in the…

John Rogers: If you're having a knife fight with your kids, and, you know, one of the knives goes through the wall, then hey, you're responsible for having to repair it.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So if something was caused by the tenant, that's different.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You said when you look at, Warren of Habitability, you should maybe take a look at…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Duty to repair? Is that what you said?

John Rogers: But it's.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Okay.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: I've got ants in my kitchen, I can't live like this!

John Rogers: And is just having ants… bored?

John Rogers: like, significant?

John Rogers: Or could you just kinda, like…

John Rogers: Spray them and wipe them away.

John Rogers: What about black widows? Black widow spiders?

John Rogers: Black Widow Spiders.

John Rogers: I was in my garage a few months ago, and I saw two of them in my garage, and I was like, what the hell are two black widow spiders? And I just, I lost them.

John Rogers: I lost them. I lost those spiders, I don't know where they are.

John Rogers: Yeah, why don't you come on over to my house?

John Rogers: I believe that's it, if I'm not mistaken.

John Rogers: Did I miss anything?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Waste.

Alice Orozco: Waste.

John Rogers: Oh, tenant cannot commit waste. Waste… the same rules of waste apply to landlord-tenant.

John Rogers: So the tenant cannot commit waste.

John Rogers: Potentially damage the property.

John Rogers: Change the character.

John Rogers: You can't be negligent, so you can't be a hoarder.

dovenight: So, same rules of what you supplied to tenant landlords.

John Rogers: Yeah.

dovenight: Let's, you know, spray up the walls and stuff with paint, and…

John Rogers: You got it?

dovenight: I'm good.

John Rogers: Okie dokie.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: Because I think that… completes the lecture of all of Property One.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, if the landlord does not want a fixture, does the… is the tenant required to remove it?

John Rogers: Doesn't want it.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Like, let's say they don't want the \$8,000 toilet. They're like, get rid of this toilet, give me back my old toilet. I want Lowe's \$150 toilet back! Exactly.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Are they required to.

John Rogers: It depends, and it gets a little bit more tricky, because it depends upon what the lease agreement says.

John Rogers: it, it, it depends. So, maybe.

John Rogers: Maybe.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So for test-taking purposes, just go for… look for a lease in that situation.

John Rogers: look for a lease? I mean…

Gevorg Kulikyan: To make your decision.

John Rogers: Oh, yeah, I mean, the lease agreement would…

John Rogers: Explain that, but if it's silent,

John Rogers: If it's silent, if a lease agreement is silent as to fixtures, then I would think that

John Rogers: The \$8,000 toilet becomes the landlord's.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: But if the landlord wants the old one, and I guess assume the landlord wants the old toilet.

John Rogers: I guess the landlord could replace the \$8,000 toilet with the \$200 toilet and sue for the cost or damages, sure.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Got it.

John Rogers: I'm sure a lot of people would want an \$8,000 toilet.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Sennett Devermont: Did you go over the other things under waste? Like, voluntary, permissive.

John Rogers: I did, about midpoint in the semester, I said the same rules apply.

Sennett Devermont: Okay, got it.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: Bass.

John Rogers: I'm gonna let the dean know that I think I got the smartest class in history.

Fatima Razavi: Shall we work on an essay, please?

John Rogers: No, we can't, we have to go over the casebook.

John Rogers: But before I be… before I do that, just want to know if there's any questions.

Andre Hakobyan: Patiently waiting for the hints.

John Rogers: Maybe I've dropped some.

John Rogers: But you're gonna have to pay attention.

John Rogers: Because… There will be a lot of hints.

John Rogers: Now, I will count reviews, too, because I'm giving you the recording, so you can hear me say it, at the very least.

John Rogers: I advise you to, but I'm gonna say more during class.

John Rogers: But…

Mireya Gonzalez: Professor, I do have a question in regard to the sublease and assignments.

John Rogers: Okay, go ahead.

Mireya Gonzalez: So…

Mireya Gonzalez: There was a… we had gotten a fact pattern in the mentor session in regards to, a 2-year lease, and the tenant vacating 3 months after.

Mireya Gonzalez: I was stuck on sublease, determining whether it was a sublease, an assignment, because of

Mireya Gonzalez: what I was thinking was less than the remaining term of the lease.

Mireya Gonzalez: So, in a sublease, because there was still a year and 9 months.

Mireya Gonzalez: I was… I don't know… like, I didn't… couldn't differentiate the two, the sublease between the assignment. Does that make sense?

John Rogers: I think you're asking you didn't know if it's an assignment or subplace.

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes.

John Rogers: And the reason you didn't know it was an assignment or a sublease is because what?

Mireya Gonzalez: Because I couldn't…

Mireya Gonzalez: The sublease definition is less than the remaining term of the lease, so because that new sublease wasn't the whole 2 years.

Mireya Gonzalez: excitement.

John Rogers: There's a 2-year lease.

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes.

John Rogers: And the tenant was there for how long?

Mireya Gonzalez: 3 months.

John Rogers: 3 months, and then the tenant transfers it to someone else.

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes.

John Rogers: How long was that transfer?

Mireya Gonzalez: A year and 9 months, what was left of it?

John Rogers: Yeah, that's the entire remainder of the lease.

Mireya Gonzalez: Entire remaining of the lease.

John Rogers: Okay, if I've been there, if I've been in the place for 3 months, I can't… rent…

John Rogers: Transferred 2 years to someone else.

Mireya Gonzalez: Right.

John Rogers: like, beyond… my… Period.

Mireya Gonzalez: And then less than the remaining term of the lease would be… it would be a sublease when it was less than a year, so, like, let's say 9 months of the lease, then, like, I'm… I'm not… that's where I'm getting stuck at. Maybe I could speak to you after class about it, so we don't take class time, but I just…

Mireya Gonzalez: I can't differentiate the definitions of those two when I'm given that fact pattern.

John Rogers: Is the entire duration… duration of the lease?

John Rogers: Being transferred to someone else, whatever's remaining.

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes.

John Rogers: Okay, that's an indication, strong indication, of an assignment. Is it less than everything? So it's only…

John Rogers: One year, 8 months.

John Rogers: If that's the case, it's more likely to be Sublease.

John Rogers: So if whatever's remaining, Completely gets transferred.

John Rogers: Then the successor is succeeding to the entire duration.

John Rogers: The entire durational interest of the lease.

John Rogers: Yes.

dovenight: If, so if someone transferred a lease, like, a few months, and then coming back, that you would say, you can't… that's a sublease, but if someone transferred the whole entire lease, left, it's assignment.

John Rogers: It certainly looks like it.

John Rogers: Yes.

Amir Akbari: I have another question from the St. Fight Padder.

Amir Akbari: There was a… there was a written agreement for that assignment, which was 1 year and 9 months. Here, we should discuss the statute of fraud, right?

John Rogers: Yep.

Amir Akbari: For the assignment, too, right?

John Rogers: I don't require it written twice.

Amir Akbari: Okay.

Amir Akbari: So, as long as we did it for the first one.

Amir Akbari: And we… and we could fail the first one, because it was on the phone.

Amir Akbari: It wasn't underwriting the domain between landlord and tenant, right?

John Rogers: Yeah, it would default to a periodic kind of thing.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, it's gonna be… then we should go follow the periodic tendency for the whole essay, or…

Amir Akbari: that's gonna be the main thing for us, because that's, we discussed the term of year, and we failed it because of a statue of fraud. Then after that, it's gonna be the periodic, then we discuss the periodic, then the team of the whole essay, it's gonna be periodic, right?

Amir Akbari: Since it's uploaded.

John Rogers: Devault's just done writing, it's done writing.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, it's gonna be months to months. That doesn't make sense to be, the term of years anymore.

Amir Akbari: That 2 years is just months to months.

John Rogers: Sure.

Amir Akbari: Then that's gonna change the remedies at the end.

John Rogers: Yes, there's… there's… I usually… Consider two directions.

Amir Akbari: Oop.

John Rogers: Some students default to a periodic, but then still move forward as if it's a term of yours. Some students will just…

John Rogers: answer the question as if it's only now a periodic one. So I… I don't…

Amir Akbari: So, if we discuss the other side, too, that's gonna be fine, right?

John Rogers: I'm very open about where you go.

Amir Akbari: Okay, that's all about the argument.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: Got it, or we just move on? Move into the book?

John Rogers: Alright, I guess we go right into the book, then.

John Rogers: 471.

John Rogers: Leaseholds, the law of landlord and tenant.

John Rogers: Everybody likes this area. It's not very complicated, right? It's easy. It's probably the easiest part of the semester, right? Would you agree?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: 472, notice the two different types of leaseholds, a term of years, THE term of yours, and two is periodic tenancy.

John Rogers: Your rule statements?

John Rogers: which are probably taken straight from here. A term of yours is an estate that lasts for some fixed period of time, or for a period

John Rogers: Computable by a formula that results in fixing calendar dates for beginning and ending.

John Rogers: Interesting.

John Rogers: Periodic tenancy is a lease for a period of some fixed duration that continues for succeeding periods until either the landlord or tenant gives notice of termination.

John Rogers: Tendency at will. A tendency at will is a tendency of no fixed period that endures so long as both the landlord and the tenant desire.

John Rogers: The last paragraph going into 474 discusses what I talked about before, about giving the tenant

John Rogers: The sole power of terminating a tenancy at will, which potentially could create a life estate.

John Rogers: Tenancy at tenants. 474, the so-called tenancy of sufferance, arises when a tenant remains in possession, holds over, after termination of the tenancy.

John Rogers: Statute of frauds and 477.

John Rogers: Every state has a statute of frauds intended to prevent just that.

John Rogers: To statute against frauds.

John Rogers: Pattern, in a way.

John Rogers: Or another after the English Statute of Frauds enacted in the 17th century. The 17th century, that was way before iPhones.

John Rogers: Commonly, the American statutes provide that leases for more than one year must be in writing.

John Rogers: There is unlawful discrimination on page 478.

John Rogers: I don't go into that,

John Rogers: And I don't usually go into the Glen Street Andrews Living Community, because it's going into… Discrimination.

John Rogers: I mean, a landlord cannot discriminate on race, religion, national origin, blah blah blah.

John Rogers: Sexual orientation.

John Rogers: I think that this is more of a constitutional law issue, and I think that… is anybody in constitutional law right now?

John Rogers: No one's in constitutional law right now. There's no one… there's no one in constitutional law. There is somebody in common law. I know you're in… I know, I know you're around.

John Rogers: They're just not saying it.

John Rogers: There is someone in constitutional law, there must be.

John Rogers: And I know you're not saying anything.

Armen Sarbashyan: Yeah, I'm in Conline.

John Rogers: There we go, it took a while, come on! Hello, someone is in Conlaw.

John Rogers: Now, you learn about discrimination in constitutional law, equal protection, right?

Armen Sarbashyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: Okay, yeah.

John Rogers: So this is more of an equal protection issue.

John Rogers: So I don't typically test on it, but just remember that discrimination can apply to landlord-tenant, okay?

John Rogers: 492, discrimination on grounds other than race, religion, and national origin. That's just a very high standard. So the next in line would be discrimination based on family status and on sex.

John Rogers: Males versus females.

John Rogers: Funny, when I was living in Santa Monica, I thought it was kind of funny, years ago.

John Rogers: They had a bunch of Christmas decorations on, like, Main Street.

John Rogers: And a lot of religious organizations complain because they say, it's only Christmas, we don't celebrate, so it should be equal.

John Rogers: There's a bunch of… Litigation going on within.

John Rogers: the city of Santa Monica. So they said, okay, we're gonna fix this.

John Rogers: We're going to promote every new religion, every year, a different one, just to make it fair for everyone.

John Rogers: What religion won?

John Rogers: It's just at random.

John Rogers: Like a lottery.

John Rogers: The Satanist one. So they just canceled the whole thing. We're not putting anything up. I thought that was great. Isn't that great? The Satanist religion one? God.

John Rogers: Putting an end to this.

John Rogers: I thought that was great, I thought that was funny.

John Rogers: Because Satanism is a religion, right?

John Rogers: It is.

John Rogers: My property book is my religion.

John Rogers: That's a religion.

John Rogers: Cannot discriminate on that.

John Rogers: can. And you will learn about that in Constitutional law.

John Rogers: Delivery of possession, Hannon versus Dush?

John Rogers: Dush?

John Rogers: Supreme Court, of Appeals of Virginia in 1930.

John Rogers: Any volunteers for this case?

John Rogers: No volunteers, huh?

Sennett Devermont: I could volunteer, Professor.

John Rogers: Right? I don't think anyone's gonna be objecting. Is there… is there any objections?

Sennett Devermont: I don't hear any. So, the facts were that Hannon rented a property from Dutch, January 1st, 1928, and then Hannon tried to move in, and then a previous tenant was still occupying the property. So, Hannon sued Dutch, arguing that the landlord was obligated to ensure the property was vacant at the start of the lease.

Sennett Devermont: Dush argued that the lease contained no such promise, and the trial court sided with Dush, and then Hannon appealed.

Sennett Devermont: The issue I put was, does the landlord have an implied duty to deliver actual possession of leased premises

Sennett Devermont: To the tenant at the beginning of the lease term. And then the rule, there's no implied covenant requiring the landlord to deliver actual possession of the property. The landlord is only required to provide the legal right to possession, not physical possession.

Sennett Devermont: And then there was the English rule, which requires landlord to deliver both legal and actual possession at the start of the lease. And then the American rule, however, requires that the tenant has the legal right to possess the property, leaving it to the tenant to remove any holdover occupants.

Sennett Devermont: So the court adopted the American rule, saying that it was unfair to hold the landlord responsible for the wrongful act by the third party.

Sennett Devermont: And the conclusion was, the judgment for Dutch was affirmed.

John Rogers: Yeah, you're right!

John Rogers: Do-do-do-do-do-do… As you'll notice, there's some courts that…

John Rogers: that I believe, and I believe when I lectured on this, I believe the majority view is still the English rule.

John Rogers: But this court followed the American rule.

John Rogers: which I believe to be the minority view.

John Rogers: But like I said, it could have changed since long ago when I started teaching this class.

Sennett Devermont: It feels kind of unsafe to, like, allow the tenant to handle that kind of issue.

John Rogers: It does.

Sennett Devermont: I'm good.

John Rogers: Almost unfair, too, but it's very specific to the prior tenant.

John Rogers: It seems better reasoned that the landlord have the obligation of removing the prior tenant. It's your property.

John Rogers: How do you lease something to me with someone already there?

John Rogers: I personally think that the English rule is a better view, but this court said, no, it's a little bit too burdensome on the landlord. The landlord is only, under this American view, is, is, required to provide legal possession.

John Rogers: But actual possession is on your own. You decide that. You have the burden. I'm only allowing you to be on the premises.

John Rogers: So you're not a trespasser anymore, you have a legal right to be there. But if there's someone that doesn't belong, then that's your obligation to get them out.

John Rogers: If you have a problem with that.

John Rogers: You should have included a provision in the lease

John Rogers: that requires the landlord to remove any holdover tenants. And you didn't. And there was no agreement to do that.

John Rogers: And part of the rationale is,

John Rogers: Not part of the rationale, but… Part of the reason,

John Rogers: that… they said that the landlord wasn't required under the American rules because the tenant has,

John Rogers: the ability to include that in the lease, but it's just not required by the law. Does that make sense?

John Rogers: But I think that the English rule is better.

John Rogers: For this sort of reason, this is very specific to holdover tenants.

John Rogers: But what about when you move in and there's maybe, like, a homeless person in there, kind of? Like…

John Rogers: They're trespassed, call the police, get them removed, but it could also be… Kind of an issue, because…

John Rogers: You're moving into a place where there are people situated that aren't supposed to be there.

John Rogers: It almost feels like the landlord should at least…

John Rogers: Well, that's… it's a bit of a crime, but… it's a bit of a crime to do that.

John Rogers: The…

John Rogers: The rationale for the American rule is it would be a little bit too burdensome on the landlord.

John Rogers: But you also want to keep in mind that this is Virginia, it's not LA.

John Rogers: And it's 1930.

John Rogers: I think it's a very good research assignment if someone wants to actually let me know and educate me on what the actual view is, the, if the English rule or American rule, what is the majority? Because about, long ago, it was,

John Rogers: the English role when I first started teaching, and that was a long time ago. I don't know if it's actually changed since then, though.

John Rogers: Perfectly good research assignment for you.

John Rogers: But notice, this case does cite to jurisdictions that one follows the English rule, another follows the American rule.

John Rogers: So, if this were to come up on an exam, and you see a holdover tenant, like a prior tenant that was refusing to leave, and the new tenant comes in, the issue is delivery of possession.

John Rogers: So, English rule, American rule.

John Rogers: English Rule requires the landlord to get them out, and to provide legal possession.

John Rogers: American. It's just, we don't have to provide actual possession, Just legal.

John Rogers: Make sense?

John Rogers: 499, notes 1 and 2 do go over… and 3 go over English rule versus American rule. There's… next case is Ernst versus Condit? Is that right? Is that how you pronounce it? Condit?

John Rogers: Conde?

John Rogers: It's in Tennessee.

John Rogers: I've never been to Tennessee. For some reason, people said that they want to move to, like, Nashville.

John Rogers: Other than that… Who cares about going to Tennessee?

John Rogers: It's just funny.

John Rogers: I just think it's funny. Oh, you're from California? That place is a dump. God.

John Rogers: Crazy people are there.

John Rogers: Yeah, it's a dump, it's very expensive, totally get it, best weather in the world, best food in the world, best views of the world, 40 million people live there, and

John Rogers: 50% of the taxes that we pay fund the other 49 states.

John Rogers: I wouldn't be bad-mouthing California.

John Rogers: Anyways, I think this is an important case because it does involve the transfer of a lease.

John Rogers: And what something is.

John Rogers: Are there any volunteers?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Professor, this is John. I found it. I can do it.

John Rogers: Go ahead, John.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Oh, by the way, does anyone else want to volunteer, or…

John Rogers: No? Okay, go ahead, John.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I apologize, it took me a while, I had to track it down. It was, it was hiding in here.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Ernst v. Condit… This is, tennessee, 1964.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I was in the Court of Appeals, Nashville in 64,

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Ernst, the landlord sued Conduit, the, unpaid rent tenant, in removal of… wait, he's suing him for unpaid rent and removal of improvements following, a lease of the commercial property.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Trial court found in favor of Ernst, holding Kant was liable, cond… was… condit… liable as an assignee, not as a mere subletsy.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Facts of the case, 1960, the Ernst and landlord leased a lot to Rogers for one year, with the option to renew.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Lease required written consent, for any transfer. Rogers built a go-kart track.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Called it, Go-Kart Raceway.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Rogers wanted to sell the business to Condit, asked Ernst to agree, Ernst approved the transfer, only after there was a guarantee of payment of rent if Condit defaulted.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): New agreement stated, Rogers sublet the premises to Condit for the remainder of the term.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): However, it also said that Rogers waives all right of reentry or control over the premises. Condit took possession, operated the track, paid the rent directly to Ernst for several months. As the term ended, Condit failed to pay rent and abandoned the property, leaving behind all the improvements. Ernst sued Condit for the rent, removal of the improvements.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Condit argued he was only a sublessee, so no privy existed between him and Ernst.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): At the rule, as privy of the state exists between landlord and assignee, making the assignee directly liable for the rent and covenants running with the land. The sublisie label versus an assignee label, party's intent and legal effect of such.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And of course, at issue here was Rogers, the, did Rogers transfer the entire remainder of his lease to Condon, creating assignment, or retain some revisionary interest, creating a sublease?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): The court looked at it, and they rejected Conant's argument that he was a sub-tenant. And although in their document it used the word sublease, Rogers retained a reversionary interest in the right of possession. Rogers promised to retain liability for rent was a surety agreement.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): But it's not evident that he retained any possessory right.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): The court emphasized that exclusive possessory for the remainder of the term was given to condent, which is the defining feature of an assignment. Intent is determined from the instrument as a whole.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And by the party's conduct. And the court quoted, we must give effect to the legal operation of the instrument rather than its name. And because Conduit had exclusive control, operated the business, paid the rent directly, Ernst was in privity of a state, personally liable for the rent.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): At their holding, the transaction constituted an assignment. Condit was liable for the rent and removal of the improvements, and at the Tennessee Court of Appeals, it was affirmed, and Condit held liable as a signee and privy with Ernst.

John Rogers: Correct! Correct, correct, correct! So what we're extracting from this case is that when examining whether the tenant assigned or subleased

John Rogers: A premises.

John Rogers: The court is going to look at the intent of the parties and the surrounding circumstances.

John Rogers: Now, the transfer between Condit and Rogers.

John Rogers: said… that… Rogers… Am I getting them mixed up?

John Rogers: Who was the assignee?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, I got it mixed up, too, over and over.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): The landlord was Ernst, and he sued Condit for unpaid rent.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Rogers… was the leasee.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Wait, court, yeah, court found in favor of Ernst held Cond liable… Conda was the assignee.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Not a sub lessee. So he was the assignee, and Ernst was the landlord.

John Rogers: Okay, yeah, so Rogers transferred to Condon. Okay, yep, that, there I got it, I… remember. So…

John Rogers: the transfer between Rogers to Condit, or Condeet, whatever.

John Rogers: specifically said that it's a sublease. Rogers hereby subleases this premises.

John Rogers: to condit.

John Rogers: This court… rejected.

John Rogers: the notion… That the words… Used in the lease.

John Rogers: are… Dispositive.

John Rogers: Instead, the court will look at

John Rogers: the surrounding circumstances. So, although the parties, their lease said, sublease.

John Rogers: doesn't mean it is a sublease. Many of you learned about the difference for the first time in this class.

John Rogers: So, this is just a cookie cutter.

John Rogers: And that was part of the argument.

John Rogers: That this court argued was an assignment.

John Rogers: First, they addressed that the agreement used the word sublease, but sublease is not controlling.

John Rogers: It's the intent circumstances.

John Rogers: I don't know…

John Rogers: That's fine, we'll do.

John Rogers: So… Rogers never actually said that he has any form of what we called a right of entry.

John Rogers: Which would be consistent with a sublease, kind of like what we learned in present interest. Reserve the right to re-enter.

John Rogers: If you just don't pay me, or there's a violation of the agreement.

John Rogers: What is very revealing, though, is that condit.

John Rogers: Remained in Possession.

John Rogers: Of this lease.

John Rogers: Even after it expired.

John Rogers: Which is consistent with an assignment.

John Rogers: Because a sublease would be… Less than everything.

John Rogers: and Condit… paid rent to who? Rogers or Ernst? And Ernst is the landlord.

John Rogers: Anybody know?

John Rogers: Well… Condon paid Ernst.

John Rogers: If it was a sublease, Condent would pay rent to Rogers, who then, in turn, would pay Condent.

John Rogers: That would be consistent with a sublease.

John Rogers: But this… the assignee condant paid the landlord directly.

John Rogers: And that's consistent with being An assignment.

John Rogers: Also, the… and the premises?

John Rogers: Rogers sold his business to Condit.

John Rogers: where Condent became the owner of all the improvements.

John Rogers: So, if someone is selling their business, to someone.

John Rogers: Does the person selling it, Rogers.

John Rogers: Probably not have intentions of coming back.

John Rogers: Probably not.

John Rogers: If there's a sale of one's business, Done.

John Rogers: So that shows in intentions of not returning to the lease.

John Rogers: So, with that in mind, collectively.

John Rogers: The court found that the intent and surrounding circumstances evidence is more of an assignment

John Rogers: Versus a quote-unquote sublease that the parties used.

John Rogers: Make sense?

John Rogers: I'll take that as a yes.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, I'm just trying to remember one thing, when it's an assignment, the landlord can sue Rogers and Condit, right?

John Rogers: Yes.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yes.

John Rogers: Because there's privy.

John Rogers: Landlords actually prefer assignments over subleases, because they have two people on the hook.

John Rogers: If we look at 506, Okay?

John Rogers: Let me read this, okay? The Ernst case indicates the two ways in which courts have gone about distinguishing between a sublease and assignment. First, and most commonly used, approach is formalistic. An assignment arises when the lessee…

John Rogers: transfers his or her entire interest on the lease, when that is, he or she transfers the right to possession for the duration of the term.

John Rogers: If the lessee transfers anything less than the entire interest.

John Rogers: If 2 years remain on the lease, and the lessee transfers.

John Rogers: For a term of 1 year, a sublease results.

John Rogers: In the latter case, the Wesley is said to have retained a reversion.

John Rogers: Their right to go… the right to possession goes back, reverts to him or her at the end of the period designated in the transfer.

John Rogers: Down below, next paragraph, the second and less common approach to the sublease assignment problem considers the intentions of the parties. The actual words sublease or assignment are not conclusive, as we just learned.

John Rogers: Though they may be persuasive, indeed.

John Rogers: One occasionally gets the impression that courts claiming to honor the intentions of the parties are, in fact doing nothing more than inferring that intention from the use of the word sublease or assignment without the slightest basis for assuming that the parties knew the consequences of what they were saying.

John Rogers: 507, note number 2, goes all into Rivety.

John Rogers: Kendall versus Ernst.

John Rogers: This is California! So it's kind of like home, right?

John Rogers: Can anyone do this case?

John Rogers: Ernest Pastana?

John Rogers: Astana.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Professor, this is John. If no one wants to do it, I can do this one too.

John Rogers: I don't know, John, I think maybe we should give a little bit more time. I think maybe someone might want to do it.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): You know, if not, I'll rock and roll.

John Rogers: Anybody want to do it, or…

John Rogers: Should we all let John do it again?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I'll keep going! I've got them all.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I guess.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Alright, Kendall V. Ernst, Hastana, Inc?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Plaintiff is Kendall et al. defendant is Ernst.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Pastana.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): This is California 1985, Supreme Court of California.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Litigation history, trial.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Held to the landlord, finding consent to assignment could be withheld arbitrarily under the lease consent clause. Court of Appeals affirmed. They went to the California Supreme Court.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Facts of the case, Bixler leased commercial property, was a hangar space up in San Jose, in 1969. It was leased for 25 years. The lease was later assigned to Ernst Pastana Incorporated, making Pistana the landlord.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Bixler subblessed the property to Kendall & Partners, who are the plaintiffs, who operate an aviation service. The sub-lesse included a clause that said, sublesse shall not assign or sublet without written consent of the lesser.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Plaintiffs sought to sell their business, which included the sublease to Kendall. Pastana refused consent to the assignment unless rent was increased, and there were other concessions that he had.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): There was no evidence that there was… that the proposed assignee, which is Kendall, was unfit or would breach this lease. The plaintiff sued. They argued under motion contract and property principles that consent could not be unreasonably withheld.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Trial and appellate court sided with Pistana, applying the traditional common law ruling allowing arbitrary refusal absent a contrary provision.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): The issue at hand is whether a commercial lesser may arbitrarily withhold consent to an assignment of a lease when the lease requires landlord consent but does not specify that consent may be withheld for any or no reason.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And, under modern California law, landlord and commercial lease may not unreasonably withhold or consent and assignment, even where the lease requires prior written consent and contains no express standard of reasonableness.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): So, the court took up the opinion that, there was the abandoning the common law… they abandoned the common law rule, and they said the leases were viewed as conveyances, and landlords can arbitrarily refuse consent. The court recognized that the modern commercial leases are… modern commercial leases are contracts, not purely conveyances, and should be governed

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): In good faith, by good faith principles. A policy against restraints on alienation, free transferability.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): In the modern trend in the restatement, court adopted restatement second, restraint on alienation. There was… the economic motivation was insufficient, and the application to the facts. Bastana's refusal was purely economic, he had no legitimate concern about the assignee's capabilities or use, and therefore the refusal was unreasonable and unenforceable.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): So, the California Supreme Court was reversed and remanded to the lower courts. In their statement, the landlord may not arbitrarily withhold consent, consent must be reasonably exercised in good faith.

John Rogers: John, I'll just ask you to see if you can answer it, but if you can't, no problem. Sure. Does this piece follow the minority or majority view?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Oh… Oh, that's a valid question. I think they took the…

John Rogers: If you know.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I didn't put it in my notes, but I think they took the majority view?

John Rogers: They took the minority view.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Did they? California took a minority view, that's intriguing.

John Rogers: California is always the minority, but… So, what we're extracting from this case is that there's an implied promise between the parties that consent to an assignment

John Rogers: Or a sublease, as we note on footnote 18 on 508.

John Rogers: Would not be unreasonably withheld.

John Rogers: This case occurred within the context of commercial leases.

John Rogers: But it says that it could potentially equally apply to residential.

John Rogers: Now, a landlord can.

John Rogers: Deny a lease transfer, whether an assignment or a sublease, arbitrarily.

John Rogers: Whenever they want. So, landlord, can I sublease to my friend Sarah? No.

John Rogers: I don't like Sarah. Okay. Can I assign to my friend Alex? No. I don't like Alex.

John Rogers: You're being unreasonable. Good. The law allows me to be arbitrary and even unreasonable. I don't have to grant it.

John Rogers: I don't have to allow you to do anything. You signed a lease with me.

John Rogers: I'm holding you to that lease.

John Rogers: The minority takes a different approach, and California follows the minority. This is, taking place in the context of commercial leases.

John Rogers: And you have to think that businesses exchange. They get sold, they get bought out, they get transferred.

John Rogers: So, you have to think that sometimes it's almost inevitable in business

John Rogers: That people are going to be asking to assign a lease to another business that could be, absorbing it.

John Rogers: So that is something that was contemplated within the minority. And there's several reasons why they said that the minority is better situated.

John Rogers: they did discuss that it wouldn't violate, any restraint on alienation. It would actually promote, businesses and commercial lease, holders to transfer it to

John Rogers: other potential tenants. The…

John Rogers: Minority View also examined contracts, okay? And most of you are in contracts now, or have taken contracts.

John Rogers: And there always is this requirement that a contract be based on good faith.

John Rogers: And the minority felt that if a landlord could just arbitrarily and capriciously deny, for no apparent reason, withhold transferring it.

John Rogers: They thought that the landlord Could potentially be a bit unreasonable.

John Rogers: And, not acting in good faith.

John Rogers: I don't know if I want to go into that.

John Rogers: I'm not sure if this case discussed breaches of contract, I can't remember.

John Rogers: I don't know, and I don't want to misquote the case, I do apologize.

John Rogers: But I believe… I don't want to misquote. I believe that this case

John Rogers: Also, as far as the minority view, Thought that it was… Fine for a transfer.

John Rogers: That the landlord must be acting in good faith, though, because it allows the landlord, to have multiple people on the hook in the context of assignments as well. I can't say that for certain. I believe that this case said that. I believe so, okay?

John Rogers: So what we're extracting is the majority view, is the landlord can arbitrarily and unreasonable withhold transferring the lease to a third party, absent their consent.

John Rogers: The minority holds that there must be a good faith belief. The landlord must be,

John Rogers: Acting in good faith, and there should be a legitimate reason why the landlord is not allowing a transfer of the lease.

John Rogers: Now, as I said before, this did take place in commercial. I seem to think it also spills over into residential.

John Rogers: But just to be very clear, this is a commercial lease. It's happening in commercial context, and part of its rationale is based on businesses absorbing one another, selling, transferring. So they said that that was…

John Rogers: Kind of a legitimate… Common instance within business.

John Rogers: That's why they were extending this. I don't know if it really would… I think that it would take place in a residential lease, but I'm not entirely positive.

John Rogers: I think there might be a footnote on it, but let me double check.

John Rogers: We are presented only… oh, this is… this is note number 17 on 5… page 508. We are presented only with a commercial lease, and therefore do not address the question whether residential leases are controlled by the principles articulated in this opinion. So, I guess, as it stands now, it's unclear whether or not this even applies to

John Rogers: Residential leaf is.

John Rogers: I stand corrected.

John Rogers: Majority view, landlord can arbitrarily Denyage of lease transfer.

John Rogers: The minority view for commercial leases, landlord must have a legitimate reason.

dovenight: Commercial lease.

dovenight: California minority.

John Rogers: Why don't we… How do we end right here?

John Rogers: So what I'll do is, I'll see you guys next week, I'll finish up these cases, I'll be really quick, and then we'll have a review,

John Rogers: And,

John Rogers: Someone sent me a \$6,000… I wanna see it, I gotta see a \$6,000 apartment in Santa Monica, I'm gonna take a look at this. But, did you guys want a review on Saturday, or no?

Andre Hakobyan: Yes.

Leanna Badar: Yes, please.

Ravinder Ghuman: Yes.

John Rogers: It's optional, you don't have to go.

John Rogers: You don't have to go.

maddykoshkaryan: What time?

John Rogers: I'll figure it out, I'll send you guys an email.

John Rogers: That's it, you guys are all paroled, now I'm gonna check out this \$6,000 one-bedroom in Santa Monica.

John Rogers: And you see this thing.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Thanks a bunch, Professor. Enjoy your weekend.

John Rogers: Thank you.

Karen Hernandez: Thank you, Professor.

Andre Hakobyan: Professor.

John Rogers: My internet's slow.

John Rogers: Is there something wrong with my internet? It's not popping up. What's going on?

John Rogers: Not coming up.

John Rogers: Yeah, it's like a blank page? Is it a blank page?

John Rogers: It's kind of blank.

John Rogers: Here we go… the park, Santa Monica. Let me see this thing. \$6,000. Limited time, up to 8 weeks for free, so that means 10 months at \$6,000, so that would be…

John Rogers: \$60,000.

John Rogers: a year.

John Rogers: \$60,000 a year, then.

John Rogers: And it's got valet.

John Rogers: Looks like.

John Rogers: Residences, let me see… residences…

John Rogers: You know what? This view is really cool.

John Rogers: You got a really killer view.

Isabella Salahshoor: The view is nice, but there's, like, no natural light.

Isabella Salahshoor: In any of the apartments, weirdly.

John Rogers: I mean, if you get, like, a corner.

Isabella Salahshoor: I found how to corner.

John Rogers: If you have a corner, I wonder how much that one is, though.

John Rogers: Oh…

Isabella Salahshoor: Yeah, I wonder how much the view ones are, probably, like, 8,000 or… Something like that.

Isabella Salahshoor: The amenities are nice. The amenities and the view, but, like, there's a lot of, like, transience around.

Isabella Salahshoor: The property, like, it's as if they live Right in front of the…

John Rogers: You never leave.

Isabella Salahshoor: Yeah, they never leave.

Isabella Salahshoor: You always hear screaming.

Isabella Salahshoor: Yeah, it's such a rip-off.

John Rogers: Okay, I'm gonna do under 5,000 bucks. Under 5,000. That's what I'm looking at. Under 5,000, because…

John Rogers: I'll go fight 5,000 to \$10,000.

John Rogers: What is that? I don't know how to work.

Sennett Devermont: The people screaming, screaming covenant of quiet enjoyment?

John Rogers: Who?

John Rogers: This is a nice place!

Sennett Devermont: People were screaming outside, like… Right?

Isabella Salahshoor: the homeless people.

John Rogers: I… if you got a really good view, sure, absolutely, but it's just, like, wild that it's like, wow, \$7,000?

Isabella Salahshoor: Yeah, it's insane.

John Rogers: That's okay. I mean, look, if someone has the money and they don't care, whatever. I just didn't know it was that expensive.

John Rogers: You know, something's THAT expensive.

John Rogers: I mean, it's \$60,000 a year, so how much did you make to probably get the… what is it like a…

John Rogers: The most is, like, a third, so you'd have to make, what, \$180,000 a year?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, can I ask you a random hypothetical?

John Rogers: Yo, go ahead.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I just want to know what the remedy would be for a situation like this.

John Rogers: So, like… Property?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yes.

John Rogers: Okay.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Like, is this a contracts issue, or is this, property…

Gevorg Kulikyan: issue with breach or something. So, like, let's say somebody purchases a house, But… the sewer system…

Gevorg Kulikyan: So, the sale happens.

Gevorg Kulikyan: And instead of the sewer being connected to the main line, like it says in the contract when buying.

Gevorg Kulikyan: It's a septic tank, but the buyer doesn't know.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So, and then… The issue arises.

Gevorg Kulikyan: What remedies can the buyer take towards the seller?

John Rogers: Good semester property.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Really?

John Rogers: Yeah, this is second semester property.

John Rogers: We'll learn this the first, the first, the first class, second semester.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Failure to disclose. Is this a potential defect, misrepresentation?

John Rogers: To be honest.

John Rogers: The buyer purchased a home thinking it was connected to…

John Rogers: The sewer, but it's actually a septic tank.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: I'm sorry, but what is the problem with a septic tank?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay, so the septic tank… is destroyed.

Gevorg Kulikyan: The middle barrier

Gevorg Kulikyan: that divides the solids and the liquids is destroyed, and it's gonna be, like, a \$20,000 repair. Oh, okay.

John Rogers: Failing to disclose defects, yeah, that's gonna be a problem, so… it…

John Rogers: It potentially could cause the buyer to go back and rescind the sale.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Hmm.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Wow. Well, this happened to me, but the seller… ended up…

Gevorg Kulikyan: the seller got scared, so he was like, I'll take care of it, and then he sent his plumber and paid for all the repairs and connected it to the main sewer line. But I just wanted to know if there was, like.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Any punitive issues in that situation?

John Rogers: All I know is… the textbook.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Hmm.

Amir Akbari: happened to me. I should pay \$9,000. But after the, like, a year. Before that, you can…

Amir Akbari: Go after them, but… After a year, you cannot.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Hmm.

Gevorg Kulikyan: The… I think the year thing is the warranty, no, for the house.

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

Amir Akbari: Because the…

Gevorg Kulikyan: There was also an issue of the seller saying he didn't know that there was a septic tank.

Gevorg Kulikyan: He didn't have the house.

John Rogers: Or didn't know.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, according to him.

Amir Akbari: But I noticed that they, they got, permission, but they never used it, and they never,

Amir Akbari: They never, did the repair.

Amir Akbari: And, it shows that they knew that

Amir Akbari: There was an issue, and they should disclose that on the… Third point.

John Rogers: Yes. Duty to disclose. We'll learn about that.

John Rogers: We're gonna have a case next semester. First week, duty to disclose defects, which include a haunted house.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Or is that like if somebody died in the house?

John Rogers: No, it's actually an interesting one. It was a home that was advertised for years as a place to go, because it was haunted, so you could actually pay, and they would take you around the house and do this haunted house. And it was sold.

John Rogers: And the new buyer Wanted to rescind the… Sale, because the…

John Rogers: Sellers did not disclose the existence of a ghost.

Gevorg Kulikyan: That's funny.

John Rogers: And the sellers couldn't say there is no ghost, otherwise they'd potentially be engaging in fraud for years, so they had to say that there was a ghost. So the whole case is, okay, was it a bad ghost? Is it a good ghost?

John Rogers: That's the whole case, because no one… no one could say there's no ghost.

Gevorg Kulikyan: That's funny.

John Rogers: So, it's like, there's a ghost!

John Rogers: So… it was funny.

John Rogers: But yeah, we'll learn all about that next semester, believe me.

John Rogers: I think you'll like this semester better than next semester, to be honest.

John Rogers: It's just double the amount of information.

Gevorg Kulikyan: As a more.

Amir Akbari: Same level?

Amir Akbari: At the same level of difficulty, or…

Amir Akbari: Bless.

John Rogers: I think… What you don't like this semester is the fees and stuff.

John Rogers: You're not gonna have that next semester, but you're gonna have a lot of information being thrown at you.

John Rogers: And that's what's going to be very overwhelming. And this semester, actually, I think is a little bit more…

John Rogers: easier to organize in your head next semester. It's not so organized. It's,

John Rogers: It's not so…

Gevorg Kulikyan: aren't the… Is the subject for next semester more practical than this semester? See, like, landlord…

John Rogers: Definitely, because you're dealing with land sale contracts. Is someone recording? Who's the recorded, holder? There's two people fighting over who owns the land, who complied with the recording laws,

John Rogers: There's a neighborhood.

John Rogers: And maybe someone wants to build something commercial, and the neighborhood says no, is there a covenant? Zoning issues?

John Rogers: Stuff like that.

John Rogers: Much better.

John Rogers: practical.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I think that makes it easier to understand.

Gevorg Kulikyan: At least for me.

John Rogers: I mean… Some people like it, some people don't.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: When you say difficult about the, the final…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: what is making it more difficult than what… the way you write it? I know you like to write vague, I get that.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: what makes her difficulty level? It's just more stuff compacted into a backed pattern? Is that…

John Rogers: Yeah, I just think that it's,

John Rogers: I'll double-check, I just thought… I thought it was hard.

John Rogers: I'm an island, this is hard.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: If you thought it's hard, then we're screwed.

John Rogers: But, here's the thing.

John Rogers: I will be grading it knowing it's hard.

John Rogers: So, the standard is much lower.

John Rogers: It's those exams that you walk out thinking, oh man, that was easy, I just crushed this. Those are the bad ones.

John Rogers: Those are the bad ones.

John Rogers: You want the hard ones. The standard is much lower, much lower.

John Rogers: Excellent.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: get… I started getting used to your, like, Making me think, like, Situation.

John Rogers: Yeah, but look, you'd be fine.

John Rogers: It's just, you'll be fine.

Amir Akbari: Is it the same language as yours, or… because there was… there was some essays, for, I think.

John Rogers: Nice, Safari.

Amir Akbari: It was a different language, you know?

John Rogers: I will,

John Rogers: I will make sure that you are prepared for your final without you realizing how prepared you are.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Sounds good.

Sennett Devermont: Thank you for the promise.

John Rogers: Excuse me.

Sennett Devermont: Appreciate it.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You dropped some good hints tonight.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You caught those.

John Rogers: I don't know if I actually did drop a lot of hints tonight.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I'm thinking it'll drop maybe one or two, maybe.

John Rogers: I know that there was one I dropped, for sure.

John Rogers: There was one I dropped for sure tonight.

Gevorg Kulikyan: and there was One more thing.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Gevorg Kulikyan: For fixtures?

Gevorg Kulikyan: on… in your notes at the end, I can't find it, but it said something about, like, an adverse possessor.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Taking a toilet, like, are they required to take the toilet with them?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Or… If they take it with them, what is that, larceny or something at that point?

Gevorg Kulikyan: I can't, let me find the note.

John Rogers: In my notes, I said adverse possessor takes the…

Amir Akbari: No, it says, if, if she takes it, but she is not successful on the adverse position, what's gonna happen?

John Rogers: Excuse me, what does it say?

Amir Akbari: It says, what if an adverse possessor installed a toilet? Does she get… take it with her if she does not succeed on her adverse possession claim?

John Rogers: If they don't succeed on an adverse possession claim?

John Rogers: My position on that is… They were a trespasser.

John Rogers: So, I don't ever really think the law protects trespassers in any way, and that's just my position.

John Rogers: They're a trespasser. It's like someone going into your home and installing something, and then saying, I want it.

John Rogers: get lost. You're on my property. Trespass.

John Rogers: I don't know, maybe I just thought of that question, and maybe I don't know how to answer it.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, there's no answer for it, it's just, you wrote the question.

John Rogers: Just to think about it.

Gevorg Kulikyan: And then, for a fixture, So if it ever comes up on a essay, like, let's say,

Gevorg Kulikyan: We see, like, okay, there's… but there's no really any questions towards it, doesn't come up, it just says the…

Gevorg Kulikyan: She installed a toilet.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Like, there's a fact that says she installed a toilet, or she did this, and there's a mention of a fixture, but there's nothing else

Gevorg Kulikyan: about the fixture. Should we still bring up the fixture.

John Rogers: Sure.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Like, oh, there is a fi- she has a fixture.

John Rogers: Sure.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: I would just still follow the call to question, though.

John Rogers: Make sure it's within the scope of the question.

John Rogers: Oh yeah, your final will have questions, too.

John Rogers: It will have questions. It's not a typical ques- it'll be fine.

John Rogers: You know what? Just… I'll tell this to the class, make sure when you read the interrogatories for the final, make sure it's relevant to that discussion, though. Like, because you might actually see things that aren't relevant to the interrogatory.

Amir Akbari: Don't…

John Rogers: Go ahead, Amir.

Amir Akbari: Then they don't need to discuss those, right? Even if some kind of issue, but if it's not related to the question, we don't need to answer those, right?

Amir Akbari: discuss those.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: It's dangerous, though, in my opinion, but yeah, you don't technically have to.

Amir Akbari: woke up.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, I've never done an essay with, like, calls of questions. It just said, discuss.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So I… Don't know how to go about it.

John Rogers: Fine.

John Rogers: Should be fine.

Amir Akbari: It's dangerous in the way it shows that you're confused, you don't know what you're talking about.

John Rogers: Look, I'll never mark you down for things you don't need.

John Rogers: Just remember that. I'll never mark you down for something you don't need. Like I said, you can talk about making or baking donuts in Egypt.

John Rogers: Doesn't matter.

John Rogers: You're not gonna get marked down.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: you shouldn't get the points, but you're just not gonna get marked down. I just won't read it.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: We say it's dangerous because if you don't put it and you might need it, then.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: That's what it is.

John Rogers: Kind of dangerous.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You'll get screwed, yeah.

John Rogers: So, just be careful.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I guess it's more important when you have less time, because then it's a decision that either you have to put it or not, and are you gonna take the time to write that or not?

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: You all are crazy not to want,

John Rogers: You all are crazy not to want,

John Rogers: Timed final exams, a real final exam.

John Rogers: Crazy.

Amir Akbari: Honestly, I did try that for myself to do it at 1 hour.

Amir Akbari: But it doesn't work. I wanted to do it in one hour, then put it at the side and start the 24 hours one, then to see what's the result, but…

Amir Akbari: When you are under the stress, it doesn't work.

John Rogers: It doesn't work, meaning, like, you can't…

Amir Akbari: Yeah, I couldn't finish, yeah.

John Rogers: finish in an hour?

Amir Akbari: Yeah, because you learn in these 24 hours to put so many details in your essays, then you are thinking about those.

Amir Akbari: then you just read the fact pattern. You just want to go over all those details, and it's not possible in one hour. You should just discuss the main issues.

Amir Akbari: This is my experience, for me.

Amir Akbari: And it's not good for us, honestly, because…

John Rogers: Every final exam that I've given you is to be completed in one hour.

Amir Akbari: Bye.

John Rogers: It's written to be done in one hour. Every single one of them. Every single question I've gone over or given you is to be done in one hour.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: And you see COVID?

John Rogers: That's all they only had, one hour! Pre-COVID, that's all they had, they had one hour. One hour.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: We think it takes us longer because we're overthinking our analysis, and we just keep adding and adding, and it becomes… like, when you're on a time crunch, you just put the main things and just move on.

John Rogers: I also think that going into finals, the time students, pre-COVID students, were more prepared for their finals.

John Rogers: The students here are not worried about it because they've got their notes, they've got all types of resources to use, so they're not stressing, they're not memorizing.

John Rogers: but the students pre-COVID Needed to memorize every single rule.

John Rogers: So, they were in your position.

John Rogers: Just trying to learn this, just trying to write essays, but then go into their final exam knowing that they have to memorize every single rule.

John Rogers: And minority, and majority, and this, and they got note cards, and they're trying to…

John Rogers: Get a crack at it.

Amir Akbari: That's the worst part. We don't do that.

John Rogers: But it's like, it all comes, boom, you see it, and you just become a robot, and you go, go, go, go, go. It's just like the bar.

John Rogers: Just like the bar.

John Rogers: But this take-home finals, it's just like…

John Rogers: I just, I don't have as many friends for take-home finals as I did pre-COVID.

John Rogers: And it's because… Students aren't stressed enough.

John Rogers: I could scare you all you want about your final, but you're still gonna be like, well, still take home final.

John Rogers: But if you had 3 hours to do it, and you had to be on campus, and you're in a room full of people, and they say, you may begin, and you have 3 hours, and you're just…

John Rogers: It's gonna be different.

John Rogers: You're gonna be really in the zone.

John Rogers: And, you know, the students really try to really learn

John Rogers: But I feel that students now, not so many. It just seems like they just…

John Rogers: you know, I'll be fine on the final, I got all my notes and, you know, whatever.

John Rogers: but… and… and less people volunteer. I've noticed,

John Rogers: A lot of students don't put in as much work.

John Rogers: A lot of the answers that I give you are in the notes I gave you, or it's in the casebook.

John Rogers: And that's what kind of makes me snap sometimes, when it's just like… It's right there.

John Rogers: All you gotta do is read it, like, put in some effort to find the answer, instead of just, like, calling me every other day with questions that…

John Rogers: All you have to do is just read left to right.

John Rogers: So, I just feel that,

John Rogers: The drive to really, really, really want to learn it is… is… Going downhill.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: But don't you feel like they still have to be… okay, they can have all the notes they want, but if they don't know how to apply it.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: It's gonna be very difficult to even use those notes, though.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: Agree?

John Rogers: I see. I don't know.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I'm trying, like, for all my classes, I try to learn the subject, but I don't really take time to memorize any rules or anything. How much harder do you think it's going to be when it's, like, time for bar prep?

John Rogers: I think that you will be okay.

John Rogers: When you do bar prep,

John Rogers: The thing for the bar was this.

John Rogers: You will thank yourself in the future if you put in the work now.

John Rogers: Your future self will thank you.

John Rogers: 100%.

John Rogers: Absolutely killing yourself, trying to learn it, and putting in all this work now.

John Rogers: Will pay off when you start studying for the bar.

John Rogers: Because a lot of stuff will come back to you.

John Rogers: But if you didn't, you're gonna look at other stuff and say, like, I don't remember that, I gotta relearn that.

John Rogers: And that's what makes things really hard on people.

John Rogers: So… I think, to answer your question, is this.

John Rogers: If you can spot the issue, if you know what it is, and you know how to explain it, and you have an idea of how it operates, you'll be able to know how to… how to…

John Rogers: How to write a rule.

John Rogers: You'll, you'll know, to make up a rule.

John Rogers: I made up lots of rules on the bar.

John Rogers: But I just know how it operates. So I was able to kind of, like, wing a rule.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, see, like,

Gevorg Kulikyan: I'm gonna bring up criminal again, because that's the only other substantive course I've taken. But, like, I can't…

Gevorg Kulikyan: I don't remember every single rule for every single crime, but I can explain it, and I'll remember, like.

Gevorg Kulikyan: certain things, like for assault, like present ability. I'll remember that. And I'll know how to explain assault rather than battery, but I can't give you the exact rule, like, willful and unlawful, and then give you a definition on willful and unlawful.

John Rogers: You can make it up, okay? Assault requires 1 intent, 2 present ability, and…

John Rogers: 3, it's unconsensual. There you go.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Just like that, for the barred, that's enough? Oh, okay.

Amir Akbari: I think for the writing portion, in our school, it's not gonna be a problem for… because they focus on the writing, and for most, if they…

Amir Akbari: like, practice, they're gonna get that, I feel, but I'm worried about the MB part, because that's more about just being fast and having a knowledge of all those details.

Amir Akbari: It's, like, clicking, it should click on the MBs, right?

John Rogers: That's hard.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, that's the hard part.

John Rogers: The MBEs are the true test of your ability of knowing the law.

John Rogers: That's the true test of the law, is the MBEs.

Amir Akbari: And you should be so fast, and quick.

Amir Akbari: 2.

Amir Akbari: Move on.

Amir Akbari: But for getting a 70 for the writing, I don't think that…

Amir Akbari: Would be a big issue for…

John Rogers: But for the MVs, for the bar, it's a marathon. Remember, that's 206 hours.

John Rogers: So 3 hours for 100. That's 1.8 minutes. That's less than 2 minutes per question.

John Rogers: It's a marathon.

John Rogers: And you're not getting, like, little tiny questions, you're getting very long ones. Ones that are equivalent, like, to essays.

John Rogers: Like, they're very long, and you're gonna have long answers.

John Rogers: And it is a marathon. You'll read a question and say, is this a contracts or property question?

John Rogers: Alright, crossovers, don't it? I don't know if they test crossover for that, but you will… it's not gonna tell you this is a contracts question. It'll be, like, a land sale contract, and you're gonna be like, is that property, or is that…

John Rogers: Is that…

Amir Akbari: contracts. Yeah, it's gonna take him, like, 10 seconds to realize that.

John Rogers: I would always skim the answers real quick to know what I'm going into.

John Rogers: So, okay, this is this.

John Rogers: So I would do that.

John Rogers: That's a marathon.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Do you have any, past MBEs that you would… Give students.

Gevorg Kulikyan: That you could share with us?

John Rogers: Yeah, I've got some sources, I'll share them, I'm just not giving you guys MBEs, this,

John Rogers: Yeah. Until we go back to in-person… until we go back to in-person timed final exams, there's gonna be no MBEs.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah. Just… just for us to have, I think, just to, like, study.

John Rogers: Yeah, I don't know, would professors still give MBEs?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: There's also a bill.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Mancini? Mancini still does MBEs.

John Rogers: Stealth is MPEs.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I think… Zand might be… no, no, no, no.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Zan doesn't. Frickberg does. He gives two essays and one for about content.

John Rogers: He does not, does he? He gives you MBEs. MBEs.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Yeah, it's like 50% of your grade, apparently.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Whoa.

John Rogers: How's this?

John Rogers: I'll give them the ease.

John Rogers: But I'll give you 100 of them.

John Rogers: And it will be…

John Rogers: 40% of your grade.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You should poll it in our next class, see what people say.

John Rogers: from 100.

John Rogers: And plus 2 essays.

John Rogers: But here's the thing. The exam should be designed to be completed in 3 hours.

John Rogers: We just can't.

Amir Akbari: demos.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Do you know what the…

Amir Akbari: Niva, e colo.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Sorry, go ahead. Go ahead, Amir, go ahead.

Amir Akbari: the Mancini ones are really difficult. You… you're struggling, like, oh my god, you cannot find an answer for that. Not you, me.

John Rogers: What makes them hard is what the best answer is. Yes. And sometimes they're all right, but what is the better of them?

John Rogers: And even for bar study, It says, what is the best answer?

John Rogers: Sometimes the best answer is the minority view.

John Rogers: Because there is no answer choice for the majority.

John Rogers: And the other choices are wrong, and this is the best one that I could see.

John Rogers: This is the best one.

John Rogers: It doesn't say it's the only answer, it's just the best answer being provided.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Do you have any idea… I heard they're changing the bar for 2028. Do you know what they're doing?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: But any idea, any… And he's…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: inklings that are out there. Apparently, they're doing something, and they're announcing it in July or something.

John Rogers: I think there… there's no more community property, it's gonna be family law.

John Rogers: Employment law is going to be tested.

John Rogers: Employment law. Employment law, yeah.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: We're gonna have a class on that?

John Rogers: Yeah.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: It's gonna turn into a new class, or it's a class that's

Nathan Rabiezadeh: converting into another class? Or do you learn that in.

John Rogers: All I can tell you is that there's gonna be a bar-tested subject about employment law.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: So they're gonna have to make it possible.

John Rogers: they're getting rid of remedies as far as a question on the bar, so it'll probably just be with contracts then, I don't know.

John Rogers: That's all I know so far.

Amir Akbari: That's cool.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You're not gonna, like, let us have the rules or something.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Probably not, huh?

Amir Akbari: Do you think it's a good idea to start to do some MBEs from this point for the bar, or…

John Rogers: Not true.

Amir Akbari: It is?

John Rogers: You won't… I don't think so.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, you don't.

John Rogers: I don't think so. Unless you're taking the class. So, look, here's the thing. If you're… if you want to do contracts.

Amir Akbari: No, no, no, not contract. The one that I'm taking.

John Rogers: what I'm trying to say is this, if right now, where you're sitting, because you're a second year, you're taking evidence and property, if you wanted to do torts, MBEs right now, I would just say no. Don't do it.

John Rogers: Wasting your time.

Amir Akbari: No, just the ones that are MTK.

John Rogers: Yeah, if you want, you can. Yeah, because it's a really good idea to see the…

John Rogers: different permutations of issues. How are things tested?

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: And it's like you're reading it for evidence. You're reading small fact patterns, and we'll say, is this relevant? The, you know, prejudicial? And you'll read the answers and say, oh, that's how it's done.

Amir Akbari: Hmm.

John Rogers: Yeah, that's, I can help you.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, I'm, I'm getting comfortable with evidence.

John Rogers: Are you? Okay, good.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, I wanna come with more questions next week.

John Rogers: for you. Okay.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, because I'm getting a little bit just…

John Rogers: Alright, I love that, my heart is melting.

Amir Akbari: I go over the whole slides and the outline last week.

John Rogers: Oh, really?

Amir Akbari: I finished that, yeah.

John Rogers: Okay, well, that's good.

Amir Akbari: That's just so…

Gevorg Kulikyan: Are, like, privileges, like, spousal privileges, is that an evidence issue?

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: Learn that in second semester evidence. Privileges.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So yesterday in Torts, we learned how one spouse has a duty to… Like, inform…

Gevorg Kulikyan: The parents of a child that has been sexually

Gevorg Kulikyan: Assaulted or battered by their spouse.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Is that not going against spousal privilege?

John Rogers: Say that again?

Gevorg Kulikyan: So, like, let's say, there's a spouse… so this is a real-life case, and they found the person.

Gevorg Kulikyan: liable, where they had a duty. So, one spouse sexually assaulted the neighbor's children.

Gevorg Kulikyan: And the spouse… Either did know or should have known that their spouse did that.

Gevorg Kulikyan: And they didn't tell the police or the parents.

Gevorg Kulikyan: They said that that spouse had a duty to do that.

Gevorg Kulikyan: But isn't that going against spousal privilege?

John Rogers: there's no communication. Spousal privilege,

John Rogers: And marital communication, it protects communications, not observations.

John Rogers: So, did you see your husband come home that night with blood on him? Yes.

John Rogers: Did he say he killed someone? Objection privilege.

John Rogers: Observations are not covered by the privilege.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, in this case, it was, the…

Gevorg Kulikyan: husband spent a lot of time in… Oh, here's one thing.

John Rogers: If you're married.

John Rogers: the spouse that's called upon to testify can not testify. They have a right not to testify. That's spousal immunity.

John Rogers: And then there's another privilege section that applies to marital communications.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, in this situation, they just found the wife liable as well, so she was also a port feeder. Or…

John Rogers: Yeah.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: Don't know anything about it.

Gevorg Kulikyan: That was weird.

Amir Akbari: Thank you so much, have a good night.

John Rogers: Yes, you guys are welcome.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Professor, appreciate the extra time, thank you so much.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Sir.

John Rogers: Yeah, guys.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Clear.
