## I. Breach of Duty: Res Ipsa Loquitur (Review)

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
[cite_start]**Res Ipsa Loquitur** ("The thing speaks for itself") is one of the three methods to prove **Breach of Duty** (alongside "conduct falling below the standard of care" and "negligence per se")[cite: 242, 243, 246].

* **Elements:** To utilize *Res Ipsa Loquitur*, the Plaintiff must prove:
    1.  [cite_start]The accident causing the injury is of a type that does not ordinarily happen in the absence of negligent conduct[cite: 261, 290].
    2.  [cite_start]The instrumentality causing the harm was in the **sole and exclusive control** of the defendant[cite: 261].
* **Legal Effect:** Successfully invoking *Res Ipsa Loquitur* creates an **evidentiary presumption of breach**. [cite_start]This shifts the burden of proof to the Defendant to rebut the presumption[cite: 450, 457, 480, 535].

### 2. Key Cases
* **Larson v. St. Francis Hotel**
    * [cite_start]**Facts:** A heavy armchair was thrown out of a hotel window, injuring the plaintiff on the street below[cite: 341, 342].
    * **Holding:** *Res Ipsa Loquitur* did not apply. The hotel did not have **exclusive control** over the furniture in the rooms because guests (occupants) had control. [cite_start]To prevent this would require a guard in every room[cite: 382, 385, 388].
* **Akiona v. United States**
    * [cite_start]**Facts:** A grenade from the Vietnam era exploded and injured plaintiffs 20 years after the government possessed it[cite: 406].
    * **Holding:** *Res Ipsa Loquitur* failed. [cite_start]The government did not have exclusive control over the instrumentality because 20 years had passed, and it could have been transferred to third parties[cite: 406, 408].
* **James v. Wormley**
    * **Facts:** A guide wire was left in a patient's chest after a biopsy. [cite_start]Plaintiff did not provide expert testimony[cite: 420, 421].
    * **Holding:** While leaving a foreign object (like a sponge) is often common knowledge negligence, specific medical decisions involving guide wires require expert testimony to establish the standard of care. [cite_start]Without it, the plaintiff could not eliminate other causes or prove exclusive control[cite: 437, 441].

## II. Causation: Overview

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
[cite_start]Tort law is a fault-based system; injury alone does not equal recovery[cite: 527, 530]. The Plaintiff must prove a causal link between the Breach and the Damages. Causation is divided into two distinct requirements:
1.  [cite_start]**Causation in Fact** (Actual Cause)[cite: 552].
2.  [cite_start]**Proximate Cause** (Legal Cause)[cite: 552].

**Note:** One must establish **Causation in Fact** *before* analyzing **Proximate Cause**. [cite_start]There is a "firewall" between them[cite: 601, 607].

---

## III. Causation in Fact (Actual Cause)

### A. The "But-For" Test (Single Defendant)

#### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Concept:** *Sine Qua Non* ("Without which it cannot be")[cite: 586, 588].
* [cite_start]**The Test:** "But for the defendant's negligent conduct (act), the plaintiff would not have been injured"[cite: 617, 625].
    * If the injury would have occurred regardless of the defendant's negligence, the defendant is *not* the cause in fact.
    * [cite_start]With a single defendant, this is the only test needed[cite: 627].

#### 2. Key Cases
* **Perkins v. Texas and New Orleans Railroad Co.**
    * **Facts:** A train was speeding (Negligence Per Se). A car drove onto the tracks, and the passengers were killed. [cite_start]Evidence showed the train could not have stopped in time even if it had been traveling at the legal speed limit[cite: 630, 643, 663].
    * **Holding:** The speeding was **not** the cause in fact. **But for** the speeding, the accident still would have happened. [cite_start]Therefore, the breach did not cause the injury[cite: 709, 760].
* **Kramer Service, Inc. v. Wilkins**
    * **Facts:** Plaintiff was cut by falling glass in a hotel (negligence). The cut later developed into skin cancer. [cite_start]Experts disputed whether the cut caused the cancer[cite: 749, 750, 816].
    * **Holding:** Causation failed regarding the cancer. [cite_start]It is not enough that the negligence *possibly* caused the harm; the plaintiff must prove it was **more likely than not** (greater than 50% probability) the cause[cite: 821, 826].

---

### B. Concurrent Causes (Multiple Defendants)

#### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Definition:** Where several acts combine to cause the injury, but **none of the acts standing alone would have been sufficient**[cite: 852, 854].
* **The Test:** The **But-For Test** applies and works here.
    * [cite_start]"But for *any* of the acts, the injury would not have occurred"[cite: 856].

#### 2. Key Cases
* **Hill v. Edmonds**
    * **Facts:** A truck driver negligently parked without lights in the middle of the road. A car driver negligently failed to see the truck and hit it. [cite_start]Neither act alone would have caused the accident[cite: 860, 890].
    * **Holding:** Both defendants are causes in fact. But for the truck parked there, no accident. [cite_start]But for the car driver's failure to look, no accident[cite: 898].

---

### C. Joint Causes (Multiple Defendants)

#### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Definition:** Where several causes **concur** (come together) to bring about an injury, and **any one alone would have been sufficient** to cause the injury[cite: 964, 973].
* [cite_start]**The Issue:** The But-For Test **fails** here (because the injury would have happened anyway via the other cause)[cite: 1119, 1136].
* **The Test: Substantial Factor Test.**
    * [cite_start]If the defendant's conduct was a **substantial factor** in causing the injury, they are liable[cite: 976, 1004].

#### 2. Key Cases
* **Anderson v. Minneapolis, St. P. & S. S. M. Ry. Co.**
    * **Facts:** Two separate fires (one set by Defendant 1, one by Defendant 2) merged and burned down the plaintiff's barn. [cite_start]Each fire alone was sufficient to destroy the barn[cite: 983, 995].
    * **Holding:** Both defendants are liable. Since the But-For test fails, the court asks if each fire was a **substantial factor**. [cite_start]Since both were substantial factors, both are causes in fact[cite: 1049, 1143].

---

### D. Alternative Causes (Multiple Defendants)

#### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Definition:** Where two or more persons have been negligent, but there is **uncertainty** as to which *one* caused the plaintiff's injury[cite: 1255, 1257].
* [cite_start]**The Issue:** The plaintiff cannot prove causation against either specific defendant using the But-For or Substantial Factor tests[cite: 1402, 1405].
* **The Rule:** The **burden of proof shifts to the defendants**. Each defendant must show that their negligence was **not** the actual cause to exculpate themselves. [cite_start]If they cannot, they are liable[cite: 1261, 1264, 1291, 1294].

#### 2. Key Cases
* **Summers v. Tice**
    * **Facts:** Two hunters negligently shot shotguns in the direction of the plaintiff. One pellet hit the plaintiff's eye, blinding him. [cite_start]It was impossible to know which gun fired the specific pellet[cite: 1232, 1240].
    * **Holding:** The burden shifts to the hunters. [cite_start]Since neither could prove the pellet didn't come from their gun, both were liable[cite: 1299, 1300].
* **Sindell v. Abbott Laboratories (Market Share Liability)**
    * **Facts:** Plaintiff developed cancer due to her mother taking DES (a drug) while pregnant. The drug was a generic manufactured by hundreds of companies; [cite_start]Plaintiff could not identify which specific manufacturer made the pills her mother took[cite: 1321, 1330].
    * **Holding:** Burden shifts to defendants. [cite_start]If they cannot prove they did not manufacture the specific pills, they are liable proportional to their **market share** of the drug at the time[cite: 1333, 1335].

#### 3. Nuance: Lost Chance of Recovery
* **Smith v. Providence Health & Services:** Where medical negligence delays diagnosis (e.g., stroke), reducing a patient's chance of recovery (even if the chance was < 50%), plaintiff may recover for the **loss of a chance**[cite: 1340, 1343].

## IV. Expert Testimony (Daubert Test)

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
[cite_start]When introducing novel scientific evidence (often required to prove causation), the trial court judge acts as a gatekeeper for admissibility[cite: 1367].

### 2. The Daubert Factors
To determine relevance and reliability, courts look at:
1.  [cite_start]Whether the theory/technique creates scientific knowledge that can be/has been **tested**[cite: 1368].
2.  [cite_start]Whether it has been subject to **peer review and publication**[cite: 1369].
3.  [cite_start]Whether it is **generally accepted** within the relevant scientific community[cite: 1370].

## V. Proximate Cause (Legal Cause)

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Definition:** Proximate cause is a **legal doctrine** (and liability-limiting tool) that **cuts off liability** for harm, even though the harm was, in fact, caused by the defendant's negligent conduct[cite: 1386, 1389, 1461].
* [cite_start]**Rationale:** It would be **unfair or unjust** to hold the defendant liable for infinite consequences of their act[cite: 1392, 1458].
* [cite_start]**General Scope:** A defendant is liable for all harmful results that are the **normal incidents of** and within the **increased risk** caused by their acts[cite: 1493, 1496].

### 2. Direct Causes
* [cite_start]**Definition:** A case where the facts present an **uninterrupted chain of events** from the defendant's negligent act to the plaintiff's injury (no intervening acts)[cite: 1502, 1508].
* **Foreseeability Rule:** If a particular harmful result was **at all foreseeable** from the negligent conduct:
    1.  [cite_start]The **unusual manner** in which the injury occurred is **irrelevant**[cite: 1518].
    2.  [cite_start]The **extent of the damage** is **immaterial** (Eggshell Skull Doctrine)[cite: 1516, 1519].
* [cite_start]**Unforeseeable Type:** If an **entirely different** or **unforeseeable type** of harmful result occurs, the defendant is **not liable**[cite: 1525, 1530].

### 3. Nuance: The Eggshell Skull Doctrine
* [cite_start]"You take your plaintiff as you find them"[cite: 1531].
* [cite_start]Even if the plaintiff is uniquely fragile (e.g., has an eggshell skull), the defendant is liable for the full extent of the injury, even if a normal person would have suffered less harm[cite: 1533, 1564].
