## Adverse Possession - Disability Rule

### Basic Disability Rule
- **Disability** pauses the statute of limitations for adverse possession
- The disability **must exist at the time the adverse possessor enters** the property
- If the disability arises **after** the adverse possessor has entered, it does NOT pause the clock

### Types of Disabilities
Three recognized disabilities (only need **one**):
1. **Minor** (under 18 years old)
2. **Incarceration** (imprisonment)
3. **Insanity/Unsound Mind**

### Critical Timing Rule
**EXAM TIP**: The disability must exist at the time of entry. This is a frequently tested bar exam issue.

**Example Hypo**:
- AP occupies Blackacre in 2010
- Owner goes to prison in 2011 (after entry)
- Owner released in 2016
- 10-year statute of limitations
- Owner files lawsuit in 2024
- **Result**: AP wins because the disability (imprisonment) did not exist at the time of entry in 2010

**Correct Example**:
- Owner is a minor in 2013 (age 16)
- AP enters in 2013
- Owner turns 18 in 2015
- 10-year statute begins running in 2015 when disability ends
- AP could acquire title in 2025 (10 years from 2015)

### Requirements for Insanity Disability
- **Adjudication required**: There must be some form of judicial or quasi-judicial finding
- Depression and suicidal ideation alone do not qualify without formal adjudication
- Must involve due process (court judgment, board decision, conservatorship, mental hospitalization)
- A physician's diagnosis alone is insufficient

### No Tacking of Disabilities
**Important Rule**: Disabilities cannot be "tacked" (combined sequentially)

**Example**:
- If a minor transfers property to someone who is in prison
- The clock starts ticking upon the transfer
- Cannot pause the clock for both disabilities in succession

### Transfer of Property During Disability
- The statute of limitations begins running when there is a transfer of ownership, even if the new owner has a different disability
- Clock will not begin until the disability is gone OR there is a transfer in ownership

### Proper Terminology for Exams
**Avoid**: "The clock starts ticking" or "the clock stops"

**Better Phrasing**:
- "The statute of limitations will begin to run"
- "The statute of limitations will not run against the true owner"
- "The time period will not run"
- "The statute of limitations period begins"

## Adverse Possession - Tacking

### Definition
**Tacking** allows successive adverse possessors to combine their periods of possession to meet the statutory period.

### Requirements for Tacking
**Privity** must exist between successive adverse possessors:
- Some formal connection or transaction between the parties
- Recognized legal instrument (deed, contract, will)
- Sale, gift, mortgage, or other transfer
- Cannot be mere abandonment followed by new occupancy

### What Constitutes Privity
**Sufficient**:
- Sale with deed
- Gift (typically requires writing per Statute of Frauds)
- Will/inheritance
- Contract
- Any recognized legal instrument showing transfer

**Insufficient**:
- Abandonment followed by new possessor finding the property
- Saying "good luck" to someone taking over the property
- No formal transaction or instrument

### Classic Tacking Example
**Scenario**:
- A builds swimming pool encroaching 3 feet on neighbor's property
- A occupies for 5 years
- A sells property to B (with deed)
- B occupies for 5 years
- 10-year statute of limitations
- **Result**: A's 5 years + B's 5 years = 10 years (tacking allowed due to deed creating privity)

### The "Good Luck" Hypo
**Scenario**:
- First adverse possessor growing apples, decides to leave
- Second person asks: "Can I have a go at this?"
- First person responds: "Good luck!" and leaves
- **Issue**: Is "good luck" sufficient to establish privity?
- **Answer**: Likely no - it's a figure of speech, not a formal transfer, gift, or instrument

## Elements of Adverse Possession (Review)

### Historical Context
- Common law statute of limitations: **20 years**
- Modern trend: **3 to 30 years** (typically 6-10 years)
- California: 3 or 5 years

### Purpose of Adverse Possession
- **NOT to reward trespassers**
- **To punish true owners for "sleeping on their rights"**
- Encourages productive use of land
- Promotes certainty in land titles

### Basic Elements
1. **Actual** entry/possession
2. **Open and Notorious**
3. **Hostile** (without permission)
4. **Continuous** for statutory period
5. **Exclusive**

## Case Law: Actual Entry

### Van Valkenburgh v. Lutz (New York - Minority View)

**Facts**:
- Lutz family used triangular lot for 30+ years
- Built shed, grew vegetables, used as pathway
- No formal deed
- Van Valkenburgh purchased record title, sued for trespass

**Issue**: Did the Lutzes satisfy the "actual" entry requirement?

**Holding**: No - adverse possession claim failed

**Minority Rule (New York)**:
- Land must be **"sufficiently enclosed"** or **"usually cultivated or improved"**
- Requires use comparable to how a reasonable owner would use the property under the circumstances

**Court's Analysis**:
- Shed with miscellaneous items
- Vegetable garden (not robust)
- No fence or enclosure
- Just "miscellaneous activity"
- Not using land as a reasonable owner would

**Comparison to Reasonable Ownership**:
- Reasonable owner would likely: build structure, fence the property, maintain it consistently
- Lutz's use: sporadic, no clear boundary markers, junk on property
- Hard to determine if someone actually residing there

**EXAM TIP**: This is a **minority view**. Most jurisdictions do not require enclosure.

---

## Case Law: Open and Notorious

### Mannillo v. Gorski (New Jersey)

**Facts**:
- Steps installed that encroached **15 inches** onto adjacent property
- Encroachment discovered only upon survey

**Issue**: Was 15-inch encroachment "open and notorious"?

**Holding**: No - too de minimis

**Rule**: Open and notorious requires that a reasonable true owner, upon reasonable inspection, would be able to recognize the adverse occupancy

**Analysis - Size of Property Matters**:
- **Small urban lot**: 15-inch encroachment likely noticeable
- **Large rural property** (60 acres): 15-inch encroachment unlikely to be visible
- Size of property is a **relevant factor**

**Test**: Would a typical person, upon reasonable inspection, recognize adverse occupancy?
- 15-inch encroachment didn't "capture the eye"
- Average person wouldn't recognize property line violation
- Too de minimis to raise notice

### Garage Encroachment Example
Per page 84: "Garage encroachment extending a few inches over the boundary line fails to supply proof of occupation by improvement"

---

## Case Law: Hostile/State of Mind

### Three Views on State of Mind

**1. Majority View - State of Mind is Irrelevant**
- Does NOT matter if possessor:
  - Thought they owned it (good faith mistake)
  - Knew it wasn't theirs and intended to take it (bad faith)
- **Only question**: Did they have permission?
- If no permission → trespasser → hostile

**2. Good Faith View (Connecticut Rule)**
- Requires possessor honestly believed the land was theirs
- "I thought I owned it"

**3. Aggressive Trespass View (Maine Doctrine)**
- Requires possessor knew they didn't own it but intended to make it theirs
- "I didn't own it but intended to take it from you"

**EXAM APPROACH**:
- Use **majority view** as default
- State of mind is **irrelevant**
- Focus on whether possession was **non-permissive**

### Mannillo v. Gorski (Continued - Good Faith Issue)

**Facts**: Gorskis claimed "we thought it was our property, we're sorry"

**New Jersey Requirement**: Good faith belief

**Most jurisdictions**: Have abandoned this requirement (per page 97)

---

## Case Law: Continuous Possession

### Howard v. Kunto (Washington)

**Complex Facts** (Think "Peace Sign"):
- Properties A, B, and C
- Everyone living on their adjacent neighbor's property
- Everyone adversely possessing each other
- Deeds describe one parcel but occupying different parcel

**Issues**:
1. Continuous possession
2. Tacking

### Continuous Possession - Seasonal Use Rule

**Facts**:
- Property used as vacation/ski home
- Occupied only 3 months per year (January - April)
- Owner in different location rest of year (Santa Monica)
- Year-round upkeep maintained (gardeners, etc.)

**Issue**: Can seasonal use satisfy "continuous" requirement?

**Holding**: Yes, if consistent with the character of the property

**Rule**: Continuity depends on the **characteristic use** of the property type
- Is it typically used as seasonal/vacation property?
- Is it commonly used for skiing, beach access, etc.?
- Does possessor use it consistently during the relevant season?

**Analysis**:
- Not abandonment if possessor returns each season
- Evidence of constant upkeep
- Use as reasonable owner would use seasonal property
- Mammoth ski cabin: seasonal use reasonable
- Lake Tahoe summer home: summer-only use reasonable

**Distinguishing Abandonment**:
- Constant upkeep = no abandonment
- Intent to return = continuous
- Seasonal pattern consistent with property type

### Tacking in Howard v. Kunto

**Facts**: Multiple successive owners, each adversely possessing wrong parcel

**Issue**: Can successive adverse possessors combine their time periods?

**Rule**: Yes, if **privity** exists between them

**Application**:
- Deed ran between successive adverse possessors
- Deed = legally recognized instrument
- Establishes buyer-seller privity
- Allows tacking: A's time + D's time = statutory period

**Formula**: A (5 years) → sells to D → D (5 years) = 10 years total

---

## Adverse Possession of Chattels

### Definition
**Chattel**: Personal property (not real property)
- Horses, jewelry, art, cars, phones, casebooks, cats, china, etc.
- Can be adversely possessed like land

### Different from Land Theft
- Not designed for intentional thieves ("I'm taking your water" = theft)
- Designed for **good faith recipients**
- "I bought this legitimately, how was I supposed to know it was stolen?"

### Special Timing Rule - Discovery Rule

**Traditional Rule**: Statute runs from time of dispossession

**Problem**: How is true owner supposed to find stolen/lost chattel?

**Modern Approach**: Clock depends on **true owner's efforts**

---

## Case Law: O'Keeffe v. Snyder (Chattels)

**Facts**:
- Painting went missing
- Discovered years later in gallery/home
- True ownership disputed
- Unclear if stolen or lost

**Issue**: When does statute of limitations run on stolen chattels?

**Rule**: Statute of limitations **pauses** if true owner makes **reasonable good faith efforts** to locate the chattel

### The Reasonable Efforts Test

**Statute PAUSES if true owner**:
- Reports to police
- Hires private investigator
- Contacts galleries/dealers
- Places advertisements
- Makes constant, ongoing efforts
- Acts diligently and reasonably

**Statute RUNS if true owner**:
- Sits back and does nothing
- Makes only minimal effort
- "Hopes it comes back one day"

**Key Principle**: Not a single effort, but a **collection of efforts** over time

**Examples of Sufficient Efforts**:
- Working with police + hiring private investigator + contacting galleries + advertisements = sufficient
- Just reporting to police alone = likely insufficient
- "I looked under a couple rocks at the beach" = clearly insufficient

### Agency and Efforts
**Question**: Does delegating to police/private investigator count?

**Answer**:
- Private investigator = agent of owner → their efforts = your efforts
- Police alone = may not be enough
- Must consider what owner could do independently
- Contact other galleries, hire investigator, advertise, go door-to-door

## Gifts (Introduction)

### Three Elements of a Valid Gift
1. **Intent** (present intent to transfer)
2. **Delivery**
3. **Acceptance**

### Intent - Present vs. Future

**Invalid** (Future Intent):
- "One of these days, I want you to have this ring"
- Speaking of future, not present
- No present intent to divorce oneself from title

**Valid** (Present Intent):
- "I give you this ring now"
- "This is yours"
- Present transfer of ownership

### Delivery - Three Types

#### 1. Actual Delivery
- Physically handing over the item
- "Here's the cell phone" (hands over phone)
- Easiest and most straightforward

#### 2. Constructive Delivery
- Used when actual delivery is **impractical or impossible**
- Giving key to represent car
- Giving deed to represent land

**Example**:
- Can't pick up car and put in suitcase
- Put key in box as 16th birthday gift
- Key represents the car

#### 3. Symbolic Delivery
- Symbol represents the gift
- Similar to constructive delivery

**When to Use Constructive/Symbolic**:
- Actual delivery impractical
- Item too large (car, land)
- Item cannot be physically moved

---

## Engagement Ring Hypo

### The Scenario
- Propose marriage: "Will you marry me?"
- Give ring
- Acceptance of ring
- Post on Instagram
- Subsequently break up

### The Legal Question
**Who keeps the ring?**

**Traditional Gift Analysis**:
- Was it a gift? (Intent + Delivery + Acceptance)
- "It was a gift! You gave it to me!"

**Conditional Gift Theory**:
- Ring given **contingent** on marriage
- Statement attached: "Will you marry me?"
- Acceptance with understanding of walking down the aisle

**Factors to Consider**:
1. **Who broke it off?** (fault)
2. **Who cheated?** (fault)
3. **Was ring a birthday gift?** (could be unconditional gift)
4. **Value of ring** (possibly relevant)
5. **Did parties marry?** (condition fulfilled?)

**Modern View** (per casebook notes):
- Conditioned on party's promise to legally marry
- If no marriage → ring returns to giver
- Unless giver explicitly said recipient could keep it
- Not a contract (special relationship exception)

**Instagram Evidence**: Extensive evidence of proposal on social media

## Study Tips & Exam Guidance

### Adverse Possession Exam Tips

**Recognition Trigger**:
- Question asks: "Who owns Blackacre and why?"
- Typically second or third call of the question
- Historically appears on second call

**Common Student Errors**:
- Professor gets "very substandard responses"
- Students must be "very careful"
- It's on the final - "Like, it's there! It's on your final!"

**Key Issues to Spot**:
- Disability timing (existed at entry?)
- Tacking (privity between successive possessors?)
- Seasonal use vs. continuous
- Open and notorious (size of property matters)
- Good faith vs. majority view on hostility

### General Exam Warnings

**Easy Exams = Danger**:
- If exam feels easy, "you're getting screwed"
- Never think "I just got an A in property"
- Easy exams are easy for everyone = higher standard
- One sentence can make difference of full letter grade

**Hard Exams = Better**:
- If exam crushes you, crushes everyone
- Standard is much lower
- These exams yield better grades

**Practice Essays**:
- Available in packet
- Can submit for review weeks 9-10
- Conditions:
  - Take your time
  - No spelling errors (use spell check)
  - Word document only (or handwritten PDF)
  - Cannot do now (too early)

### Coming Attractions

**Next Week**:
- Continue with Gifts (one case)
- Acquisition by Creation (quick lecture)
- Begin **Estates in Land** (professor's favorite)

**Warning about Estates**:
- "The awful part, the part that they hate the most"
- Students historically have difficult time
- "Another dimension for next 5-6 weeks"
- Will take "baby steps"
- Must keep up with material

## Key Takeaways

1. **Disability must exist at time of entry** - most important timing rule
2. **No tacking of disabilities** - cannot combine successive disabilities
3. **Tacking requires privity** - formal instrument/transaction between adverse possessors
4. **State of mind irrelevant** (majority view) - only matters if had permission
5. **Seasonal use can be continuous** - if consistent with property character
6. **Open and notorious** - property size matters for visibility
7. **Chattels - reasonable efforts test** - true owner must actively search
8. **Gifts require intent, delivery, acceptance** - delivery is usually the crux
9. **Constructive delivery** - when actual delivery impractical/impossible
10. **Adverse possession punishes owners** - for sleeping on their rights, not rewards trespassers

## Important Distinctions

### Tacking vs. Disability
- **Tacking**: Combines time periods of successive adverse possessors
- **Disability**: Pauses the statute for incapable true owners
- Cannot tack disabilities together

### Good Faith vs. Majority Rule
- **Good Faith** (minority): Must believe property is yours
- **Majority**: Intent irrelevant, just need non-permissive possession

### Actual vs. Constructive Delivery
- **Actual**: When you can physically hand over the item
- **Constructive**: When actual delivery impractical (car, land, large items)
- Default to constructive only when actual is impossible/impractical

### Continuous vs. Abandonment
- **Continuous**: Seasonal use if consistent with property type, constant upkeep, intent to return
- **Abandonment**: Leaving with no intent to return, no upkeep, breaking possession
