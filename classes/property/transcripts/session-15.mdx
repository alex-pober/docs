# Property - Session 15

## Transcript

John Rogers: You don't have an idea of what you want to do tonight?

Mireya Gonzalez: A review and essay would be great.

John Rogers: You can do that.

John Rogers: Just a heads up, I don't think very many of the essays that I have, that I've given you.

John Rogers: would… match your final, but I think it's still good anyways.

John Rogers: We can go over a few of them if you want.

John Rogers: I don't think we've gone over a landlord-tenant, have we?

John Rogers: Only we have.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Just in a constructive eviction.

John Rogers: Okay.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, do you want to make up an essay, by any chance? That's… Similar to the final?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Similar to the final? Yeah. Yeah, Fatima, good call.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): What do you think.

Fatima Razavi: But not the final, but similar. Instead of A for, like, you know, Alice, it could be Alex.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Right?

maddykoshkaryan: She's so smart.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Good job!

Fatima Razavi: Not really, I just want to help you, Professor. Help us.

John Rogers: See, the thing is, requiring effort.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Dellin' hard.

John Rogers: I'm not really good with that effort thing.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Professor Domogen didn't give, like, her own students some of, like, practice essays that you may have.

John Rogers: She gave some to her students.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Did she? I don't know, she probably did.

John Rogers: I have no idea if she did or not, I have not a clue. No clue.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Hmm.

John Rogers: I keep asking you, what do you… what did… what's going on with her class, and none of you guys have any friends, so, I mean, you can't ever tell me.

John Rogers: It's a joke. It's a joke.

Amir Akbari: And dated question 5, 25, 3, and 20.

John Rogers: Pardon?

Amir Akbari: And they did four questions, four essay questions in their class question 5, 25, 3, and 20.

John Rogers: 5, 25, 3, and 20, so 3, 5, 20, and 25?

Amir Akbari: Yes.

John Rogers: The… the ones I've given out?

Amir Akbari: Yes, from the same package.

John Rogers: Let's take a look.

John Rogers: So, question 3, I don't know if we went over or not, but it's… I'm not gonna say it's similar to it, but it's written in that kind of way, sort of.

John Rogers: So, 3… Okay, and is it 5?

John Rogers: That's Alice in Wonderland.

John Rogers: These are 20.

John Rogers: We can do 20. This is…

dovenight: Give us some hints.

John Rogers: Yeah, don't worry.

John Rogers: If you do 20, let me see 25.

John Rogers: I thought we did 25, didn't we?

Jude Seleck: We did…

John Rogers: We did do 25.

John Rogers: 25 is sort of good.

John Rogers: What would you guys like to do?

Leanna Badar: Can we start with 20?

dovenight: What page is this on? What essay is this?

John Rogers: 20?

Jude Seleck: I guess we did 20 also.

John Rogers: Oh, we did.

Jude Seleck: Yeah, we did.

John Rogers: Are you sure we did? I don't remember doing this.

Jude Seleck: I guess, in the review class?

Jude Seleck: Because I have notes on it, so…

John Rogers: In, like, a mentoring class, or… I don't remember.

Jude Seleck: No, I'm not in mentoring class. Either in class, or… because I have notes on it already.

Jude Seleck: So…

John Rogers: Yeah, I didn't… I didn't… I don't remember covering it.

John Rogers: I can cover it if you want.

John Rogers: I can do whatever you guys want.

dovenight: You're not gonna have public nuisance on it. I know that they were teaching that, in mentoring, so you're not having public nuisance the next semester, if we make it.

John Rogers: nuisance. Who's giving you public nuisance?

dovenight: The mentoring for Severian, we were just looking at it, and I was like, wow.

John Rogers: Public nuisance? No, because it's an entire…

John Rogers: Yeah, that's a chapter next semester.

John Rogers: It's an entire chapter next semester, public and private nuisance. So we're definitely not learning in here.

Yessenia Soria: Professor, you said that we are using the same book, right?

John Rogers: I would assume so, Duke Vineyard.

John Rogers: I think so.

Yessenia Soria: The same book as who?

Yessenia Soria: The one we're using right now for properties for next semester.

John Rogers: Oh, yeah, it'll be the same book. Same book.

John Rogers: And that'll be my officially last semester teaching property, which is in the spring. And then I am gone.

Yessenia Soria: Thank you so much for keeping us.

Yessenia Soria: Thank you so much for keeping us, not leaving us abandoned. I appreciate it.

John Rogers: Oh, don't thank me, I tried to ditch you guys so fast, but they wouldn't let me, so…

dovenight: Oh, no…

Yessenia Soria: Did you say you wanted friends?

John Rogers: Right.

Yessenia Soria: Jazz.

John Rogers: I can do 20 if you guys want, doesn't matter, we can go over a bunch of them. We can just start with 20, and if you have one that you like, we can do that one too. I mean, whatever.

Amir Akbari: It's due to any police.

Yessenia Soria: Let's do 20.

John Rogers: Yes, I'll still be teaching evidence.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, I'm ready.

Yessenia Soria: All right, let's do number 20.

John Rogers: You guys all see this okay? Fall 2019!

John Rogers: that was the class that transitioned to remote because of COVID.

John Rogers: I remember this class.

John Rogers: I remember.

John Rogers: Let's see, what did I do? So this was a one-hour final, so students only had one hour due, so this was a real final exam.

John Rogers: What rights, if any, does Larry have against Tina and Al? It's just short.

John Rogers: And what defenses, if any, may they assert?

John Rogers: discuss. Thank you.

John Rogers: Larry owns an apartment building, so I usually like to say L for Larry for landlord. Owns an apartment building. I still like to do FSA. What is Larry?

John Rogers: What does that? It's not red.

John Rogers: On December 1st, 2018, So there's a specific date.

John Rogers: When there's a specific date on a landlord-tenant hypo, I always, at the very beginning, I always think to myself a term of years lease, because there might be a fixed end date involved.

John Rogers: The landlord leased an apartment, so it's one apartment to Tina, the tenant…

John Rogers: for one year, at \$100 per month. Woo-hoo.

John Rogers: Not like that \$6,000 place in Santa Monica.

John Rogers: Okay, so the first issue is what type of lease was created?

John Rogers: Looks like a term of yours lease.

John Rogers: Commencing on… December 1st, 2018.

John Rogers: So you see term… Years. Oops. Ugh.

John Rogers: Ugh.

John Rogers: Notice does not need to be given because it's been predetermined.

John Rogers: Notice of termination, and statute of frauds. It does not have to be in writing because the terms of the agreement do not exceed one year, so it does not have to be in writing.

John Rogers: Doesn't have to be in writing.

John Rogers: Oh, but the lease agreement? Okay.

John Rogers: contained a provision, so that tells me it actually is in writing, then, that Tina cannot sublease the apartment without Larry's written consent. So this is a constraint, restraint clause.

John Rogers: And it's strictly Construed.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: It's strictly construed in favor of tenant, so although the tenant cannot sublease, the tenant is free to assign.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Do you know it was accepted… accepted to… it should say INTO medical school, okay? It should say INTO medical school. What an idiot. And decided to move out of state. Hmm.

John Rogers: Doesn't say when, though.

John Rogers: Okay, so I would assume it's within 6 months afterwards.

John Rogers: So this shows intent language, intent to return.

John Rogers: I would just be looking at this language right here. Does this show her intentions of coming back to the lease?

Amir Akbari: Probably not.

John Rogers: So, believing the no-lease sublease provision was unreasonable, on May 1st.

John Rogers: 2018, Tina agreed to sublease the remainder of her lease to Al. So there's a transfer. So on that.

John Rogers: What type of transfer occurred?

John Rogers: Anybody know?

Amir Akbari: Assignment? Assignment?

Amir Akbari: It's everything.

John Rogers: A lot of students who took this wrote, It's a sublease! It said sublease!

John Rogers: Go back to what I said in class. It's an assignment.

John Rogers: So, you could say that it's,

John Rogers: Majority view.

John Rogers: Minority.

John Rogers: equals sublease.

John Rogers: Now, You'd want to say…

John Rogers: I wrote this, so it's a big discussion.

John Rogers: That if you see something like this, you want to pull as many facts as you possibly can for this transfer.

John Rogers: So it says sublease the remainder of release to owl. It's measured on intent in the surrounding circumstances, so the intentions and part of the surrounding circumstances is right here. Move out of state. So there's no intentions of returning.

John Rogers: And Tina transferred the entire, remaining duration of her lease 2 owl.

John Rogers: So that is an indication that it's an assignment, but…

John Rogers: I want to just kind of also look for facts later on, that evidence and assignment as well. So this is… this was a way I could,

John Rogers: distinguish the higher scoring students, especially on a real final exam like this, is how many facts did they explain to prove up that this is an assignment? Because if you just say this.

John Rogers: you're not gonna, you know, everyone's gonna say this. So it's like, how do you distinguish yourself? So you'd want to look for additional facts as we will read on.

John Rogers: Upon moving in, Al… noticed the apartment had no running hot water. Well, so what?

John Rogers: You could just take a shower in cold water. What's the problem? Take a bath in cold water.

John Rogers: An ice bath every morning.

John Rogers: No running hot water. So there's no running hot water.

Amir Akbari: And terrified, okay?

John Rogers: No running hot water.

John Rogers: And there were several electrical wires hanging from the ceiling.

John Rogers: Now… I can't hold it… Against the students?

John Rogers: But I was very open.

John Rogers: To the students who said, well, there are electrical wires, but are they live wires?

John Rogers: And would that.

Sabrina Malekan: Thank you, Tiffany.

John Rogers: If it's live wires, then, yeah, I mean, I would assume you get electrocuted.

John Rogers: So this is potentially bringing up a habitability issue, maybe even constructive eviction, I would assume so.

John Rogers: Now, how is… does no running hot water deem the entire apartment uninhabitable?

John Rogers: Well, I would say… I would think that what was contemplated under the lease is to have hot water.

John Rogers: Wait.

John Rogers: So it kind of… Affects the entire lease, the entire premises.

John Rogers: And no running hot water, and several electrical wires. So yeah, there definitely could be a habitability issue. There's electrical wires hanging.

John Rogers: Live or not, it certainly Is not aesthetically pleasing.

John Rogers: I can't remember, but I, you know, usually I always get one student doing a real final exam that says, well, it's only 100 bucks a month, what do you expect? So, it's like, yeah, I guess you're right, huh? But I wouldn't think like that.

John Rogers: I don't think that you should, factor in this figure.

dovenight: Can I ask a question about restraint clause? So we put restraint clause, for writing a… register.

John Rogers: Yeah, you put it. It's strictly construed.

John Rogers: In favor of the tenant.

John Rogers: Just say restraint clause. You could say no transfer clause. I think my notes have no transfer clause, can't remember.

John Rogers: When Al informed Larry of the lack of hot water and hanging electrical wires, Larry stated that he will fix the problem once he obtains enough money to pay for the repairs. So then this goes to notice of some sort, right?

John Rogers: So that's notice, potentially for implied warranty of habitability, as well as notice for a potential, I would assume, constructive eviction claim as well.

John Rogers: Hmm… Oh, I remember this one.

John Rogers: Interesting. Oh ho ho ho, this one was deep.

John Rogers: This was deep.

John Rogers: Al reported his apartment to the local building inspector. Oh, you snitch!

John Rogers: Terrible!

John Rogers: When Larry received notice of the building inspector's investigation.

John Rogers: Larry contacted Al and said he was raising the rent an extra \$100 per month. What is that?

Sennett Devermont: Retaliatory eviction?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Is it?

Sennett Devermont: Yeah, because after you submit a code or a violation within, I think you said, like, 90 days, and then it was 120 days, there's two different time periods, and then if they raise the rent.

Sennett Devermont: or give less services, yeah, that's what it is. I mean, you're fine.

John Rogers: Here's the thing. I know what it says.

John Rogers: But… And that's exactly what I was testing on here, but it's deep.

John Rogers: And this was a real final exam, where students had to actually memorize, and they didn't get 36 hours.

John Rogers: But… I was really… and some students got it, and I was very impressed. VERY impressed with them.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Because you don't know how long?

Amir Akbari: It's just…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: He raised their rent?

John Rogers: Well, it says…

Gevorg Kulikyan: Here's the.

John Rogers: On May 1st and June 1st, so this all happened within a month.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Is it the enough money, Professor?

John Rogers: What?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Is it the enough money to pay for the repairs?

John Rogers: Where you getting at?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Well, he said he will fix the problem when he has enough money to pay for the repairs.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So he's… Raising the rent to make more money to pay for the repairs.

John Rogers: And it's not a reasonable time.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I would argue.

Gevorg Kulikyan: the one month.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Something like that.

John Rogers: You are REALLY close.

John Rogers: you're just… Dangerously close.

John Rogers: The rule contains that… was it 180, or 120, or 90 days? I forget.

John Rogers: That if the landlord Raises the rent within that period.

John Rogers: It's PRESUMED to be retaliatory.

John Rogers: But is there an alternative explanation than being retaliatory? So is there a good faith reason why the landlord wants to increase the rent versus, trying to punish someone?

John Rogers: So, what is it? Punishment, or raise money for the repairs?

John Rogers: You can't accurately conclude That it's either.

John Rogers: You don't know.

John Rogers: Someone will have to actually text Larry and let me know. Dying to know.

John Rogers: But, unfortunately, if you don't have Larry's number, we have not a clue.

John Rogers: We don't know.

John Rogers: So unless you could text Larry, we kind of have to just figure it out ourselves.

John Rogers: So, that… therein lies the issue.

John Rogers: Was Larry's intentions to punish Al, or was Larry's intentions in good faith, just trying to raise money to make the repairs?

John Rogers: I don't care what you say.

John Rogers: I don't care.

John Rogers: Make sense?

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: There's also another thing.

John Rogers: Al informed Larry of the lack of hot water and hanging electrical wires. That's also consistent with… an assignment.

John Rogers: Because if it were a sublease.

John Rogers: then Al would bring his issues to Tina, and Tina would then go to Larry.

John Rogers: But is this a retaliatory eviction? That's deep. It's kind of deep.

John Rogers: And hey, some students saw it.

John Rogers: Some eyes are hand raised.

Mireya Gonzalez: As far as…

Mireya Gonzalez: for… because I'm having trouble with, like, adding additional, like, facts that you get on later on in the fact pattern to, like, a certain…

Mireya Gonzalez: like, in this case, the assignment. So we are able to, like, go to the last paragraph of the fact pattern if it were to apply, like, within that one assignment. Like, you could pull.

John Rogers: Yeah?

John Rogers: Another hand raise.

Amir Akbari: And so here, a landlord doesn't have a duty to do that repair, because that's the warranty of availability.

Amir Akbari: Because it's…

Amir Akbari: I mean, we can do both side argument and do that argument on the essay, but I just want to know, is there a, like, duty or no? Because as I see, it's the duty of landlord to do that repair.

John Rogers: Yeah, duty to make repairs? You can absolutely write that if you want. I don't usually test on it a lot, but yeah, write it in there. I love it. I love it.

John Rogers: The bigger issues imply warranty of habitability, though.

Amir Akbari: And it would negate the claim of the landlord to say, I'm raising the money to do this repay, right?

Amir Akbari: Because he had… he already had… have obligation to do the repair.

John Rogers: Yeah, you could say that. But, I don't know how you get around the fact that there was a lease agreement at \$100 per month, but now you're just, like, raising it an extra \$100?

dovenight: So we put constructive eviction and a flight warranty on highway and retaliatory eviction.

John Rogers: In this one, I would discuss both, but the problem is, implied warranty of habitability, you can potentially,

John Rogers: Find it here.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: I think that there's a strong probability that you will find it here, but you can't, from what we have read so far, you can't find constructive eviction because…

John Rogers: Al never vacated. Yet.

John Rogers: But I think he does it the next sentence.

John Rogers: Another question.

Amir Akbari: Can we also raise the issue of safety here for the live wires, or…

John Rogers: Safety? Where is that?

Amir Akbari: For the live wires.

John Rogers: Yeah, I know. What about safety?

Amir Akbari: It's dangerous? Is someone touched?

John Rogers: Yes! So, could you discuss that under implied warranty of habitability, or even, like, a constructive eviction claim?

Amir Akbari: Hmm.

John Rogers: No reasonable person could live here.

dovenight: So we put constructive conviction later, but… because he does leave apartment.

John Rogers: you can… here's the thing. You MUST discuss constructive eviction on this. You have to. There's no way you're getting around it. You gotta discuss it. I just haven't,

John Rogers: said it yet, but I did say it partly here when I talked about notice, because I said here that this provides notice for implied warranty of habitability of the issue, as well as constructive eviction.

John Rogers: Fine, I'll just say.

John Rogers: There we go. There we go.

John Rogers: Now… For implied warranty habitability, there's no requirement to vacate.

John Rogers: But the tenant does not have to vacate. They could still be living there, and…

John Rogers: And assert the implied warranty of habitability.

John Rogers: It's implied because it does not have to be in writing. It's implied in every lease. In fact, you can't write yourself out of it.

John Rogers: Note that.

John Rogers: On June 1st, 2019,

John Rogers: Al tendered the apartment key and a note to Larry indicating that Al was vacating the apartment.

John Rogers: Is that a surrender?

Daniel Sinanian: I have a question regarding that, for the retaliatory addiction. So, when that gets played.

Daniel Sinanian: It doesn't have to be between 90 to 180 days, because it says May 1st, 2029 to June 1st, and that's less than 90 days.

John Rogers: So, it's… if it's within 90… that… Okay.

John Rogers: I should probably rewrite that, but I don't think I ever have to ever again, because I may not ever teach this class again. But what I meant was…

John Rogers: If it's from 0 to 90, or 0 to 120.

Daniel Sinanian: Oh, okay.

John Rogers: So that was poorly written on my part. So it's from 0 days to 90, or 0 days to 120.

John Rogers: It doesn't actually have to happen between 90 to 120. I said 90 to, like, 120 because jurisdictions are different. Some say 90, some say 120 within that period.

John Rogers: So this is an offer to surrender, it looks like, okay? Now, it's contingent upon

John Rogers: Larry accepting it, though, and I can…

John Rogers: So, it's a potential offer to surrender. Now, Larry repeatedly contacted Al for lost rent, so that is an indication that it was denied.

John Rogers: Is that, abandonment?

John Rogers: It may look like it, so treated as an abandonment, right?

John Rogers: You abandoned the lease, you got out, now you owe me money.

John Rogers: Each time, so Al repeatedly contacted

John Rogers: No, Larry repeatedly contacted Elle for lost rent.

John Rogers: each time.

John Rogers: Al?

John Rogers: Refused to pay any rent.

John Rogers: After he moved out.

John Rogers: Going on there?

Fatima Razavi: Doesn't Larry have a duty to try to find a replacement?

John Rogers: So it's going to duty.

Amir Akbari: YouTube is me.

John Rogers: So, he's trying to get his rent. I just… you owe me! You owe me the money! And Al's refusing. So I just keep calling, or writing him, or…

John Rogers: Sending him smoke signals? Who knows what?

John Rogers: I'm trying to get it from Al.

John Rogers: But the standard is… the rule to apply is locate a new tenant.

John Rogers: And you have been provided nothing here. It indicates that Al attempted to… Locate a new tenant.

John Rogers: For 6 months.

John Rogers: So since Al did not, fulfill his… due diligence requirement.

John Rogers: His duty to mitigate.

John Rogers: or Larry, sorry, Larry did not fulfill his, duty to mitigate requirement.

John Rogers: Larry's gonna have a problem collecting.

John Rogers: rent from June 1st to December 1st.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Would you say anything about minority or majority in this section? Because in minority, you don't have to mitigate, or you would just presume that it's majority?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Or you would make the presumption that it's majority?

John Rogers: Oh, you always, you always go with majority. It's always, always, always majority view.

John Rogers: Okay.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Do you want to even bring up the minority, like, if this were to be in a minority?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Oh, you don't need to.

John Rogers: just, you can include a sentence that says, under the minority view, there's no duty to mitigate, period. That's it. So the focus should always be majority.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, for the duty to mitigate

Gevorg Kulikyan: In this scenario, are we just assuming that he didn't do anything to mitigate based off of him constantly requesting for the back pay, or the rent?

John Rogers: Well, first off, I don't know Larry's pronouns, so we can't necessarily call Larry a he, but for me, then sure. Okay, sure. We can call Larry a he. Okay. Anyways, you lost me when you said that, so would you say? Repeat it?

Gevorg Kulikyan: So… In this scenario, are we just assuming that the landlord did not

Gevorg Kulikyan: Take any steps to mitigate based off of that he just constantly asked for.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Al to pay the rent.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Is that the fact that we're using?

John Rogers: all you have been provided is that Larry…

John Rogers: tried to get rent from Al.

John Rogers: That's all you're given.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So the assumption is that if he's asking for the rent for every single month.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Then he didn't find a tenant.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Is that…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Or he wasn't… or he wasn't advertising it or anything, either.

John Rogers: The question is this. Did Larry use reasonable diligence to locate the new tenant?

Fatima Razavi: No.

dovenight: The effects are silent.

John Rogers: Yeah, you don't… you have not been provided. The only thing that he may arguably have had diligence over is collecting rent from a tenant who potentially abandoned.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay. Yeah, see, that's… that's what I was getting at. There's, like, no facts to highlight that he didn't do anything reasonable, besides that he just kept asking for the money.

John Rogers: So he vacated, so this potentially completes a constructive eviction claim, since Al is no longer…

John Rogers: In the, apartment anymore.

Amir Akbari: And also, there is a note over there for the notice.

John Rogers: a note?

Amir Akbari: the same line.

John Rogers: This was a real-world final, to be done in one hour. This isn't that bad, is it?

dovenight: Actually, it's not that bad,

dovenight: It's just the, you know, the restraint clause, I have to remember and stuff, but they can't, you know, everything…

John Rogers: Okay.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Where's that restraint clause?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Where would that… where does that fall under? Does that ask?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Is that its own thing, or is that within another…

John Rogers: It's its own… Issue, independent, and it could be very short.

Amir Akbari: And it would be, assignment versus sublease is correct.

Amir Akbari: Because of that… I would probably write it before that discussion.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, then, do we need to have privity of contract, privity of state, or no?

John Rogers: When you talk about assignment, and you conclude that it's an assignment, then yeah, you talk about privity 100%.

dovenight: Okay. I wanted to note, the restraint clause, is that in the, where's that located? Is that in the.

John Rogers: I don't know, maybe you can, do a word search?

dovenight: Yeah, I'll… I'll look in the notes.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, you might have answered this with, Amir's question, but you said to get a higher score, we had to justify why it was an assignment, so… and you said as we would read along, we'd figure that part out, so what are some other points.

John Rogers: Note to Larry?

John Rogers: note to Larry, and informing Larry of the issues.

John Rogers: This is all consistent with an assignment.

John Rogers: Because… Had this been a sublease.

John Rogers: Al would have brought his or her, because it could be Alexandra, and maybe she goes short by Al.

John Rogers: No, but it says his. Okay, never mind.

John Rogers: So Al could have,

John Rogers: If it was consistent with a sublease, Al would have brought his complaints and issues to Tina.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, because of that note, we say there is an offer to surround the rye.

John Rogers: Yeah, looks like it, but it's always contingent upon the landlord accepting it, and the landlord doesn't have to accept it.

John Rogers: And we can tell the landlord didn't.

John Rogers: Because he's repeatedly contacted Al for lost rent. Give me money!

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So the call to question, it's saying, what rights does Larry have against Tina and Al? So, he can sue… Larry can sue Tina as well, but what would her defense be?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Would it also be… The constructive eviction as well.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Or the…

John Rogers: habitable.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, so Tina can also use that same defense, even though Tina wasn't living there.

John Rogers: Sure. Okay.

John Rogers: I think I should say AND, OR Al.

dovenight: So Al can definitely sue both of them, because they were all, you know, definitely Tina and Al.

John Rogers: Everybody can sue each other.

John Rogers: It's an assignment, so once there's an assignment, everybody can sue each other, because everyone is in privy with one another.

John Rogers: So, look, dis… was something that I wasn't expecting students to see.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: It was here at… okay, I just…

John Rogers: At the time when I wrote things, when I wrote this, It's a one-hour final.

John Rogers: So, their mind is racing, and how fast can they think and spot things and write? So, it was much easier. So when I saw students that could pick up on that, it was very impressive, and that was much easier as far as grading.

John Rogers: But that's what I was getting at. But I didn't… Heavily rely on that.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So I wasn't expecting everyone to see it.

dovenight: Can we get a copy of the…

John Rogers: Sure.

John Rogers: I'll get you a copy.

dovenight: Thank you, Mr. Professor, thank you.

Sennett Devermont: I was wondering, why is, you said the restraint or the no transfer clause, why was it in favor of the tenant?

Sennett Devermont: Or why do you mention in favor of tenant?

John Rogers: Well, they're always in favor of the tenant. So, if there's a provision that says that you cannot sublease, it's always construed.

John Rogers: So, strictly construed, so there's nothing saying that you can't assign, or if it says you can't assign, you're free to sublease. If you can't sublease.

John Rogers: You're free to assign.

Sennett Devermont: And if it says neither, then you can do both?

John Rogers: No.

Sennett Devermont: Oh.

John Rogers: But neither?

Sennett Devermont: Yeah, it doesn't mention you can't do either.

John Rogers: If it doesn't mention anything, you're free to do whatever you want.

Sennett Devermont: Okay.

John Rogers: But if the provision says you CANNOT assign or sublease, then you're stuck.

John Rogers: Then it's construed to what?

John Rogers: I dropped it in the chat.

dovenight: We profess there.

John Rogers: Any other ones you guys want to go over?

Fatima Razavi: You mentioned 25 was very similar?

John Rogers: I don't remember saying that, did I? I thought you did.

Alice Orozco: Question 3. Question 3.

John Rogers: Question 3. Didn't we go over Question 3? I feel like we did.

John Rogers: I feel like we did.

John Rogers: Long ago.

Jude Seleck: Yeah, we did question 3 and 25 also.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: I don't know where you guys have been, you guys have been out to lunch.

Fatima Razavi: I just thought you said that, I apologize, I didn't check the question.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Professor, which one do you think we should go over that's closest?

John Rogers: I don't know, I don't know! I have no idea. You can go over all of them if you want, doesn't matter.

John Rogers: Dude.

Amir Akbari: Do the number 3.

John Rogers: Didn't I just say that? Didn't I just say we went over number 3 previously?

John Rogers: Did we not… can someone please answer me this?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I don't.

John Rogers: Did we go over Question 3 previously?

John Rogers: Maybe we didn't.

Yessenia Soria: I print everything out, and I don't have it.

Amir Akbari: No, we didn't.

John Rogers: I'm sorry.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: begin.

John Rogers: You print everything out, and you do not have question 3?

Yessenia Soria: I have a question number 3, I just don't have the notes to it.

John Rogers: We'll be getting.

Yessenia Soria: And I've only… Huh?

John Rogers: Maybe they didn't give it to you.

Yessenia Soria: Hmm.

John Rogers: I don't know if he did it or not.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: If we go over it, I document it, and I personally don't have it documented, so…

John Rogers: We'll go over it.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Or maybe I may be wrong, I don't know.

Alice Orozco: I think we're continuing with question 4, that was the Rose Garden.

Alice Orozco: So…

John Rogers: I remember the Rose Garden, yeah.

Alice Orozco: Yeah, we've done that.

John Rogers: The Rose Garden one is a good one.

John Rogers: That's a good one.

John Rogers: because it's… Like it, sort of?

John Rogers: Can I create a hypothetical? Ain't happening. That requires effort. That's effort.

John Rogers: I don't want to do effort. I don't like effort.

John Rogers: Look, you guys are gonna be fine, because here's the thing about your final, okay?

John Rogers: It's less gray. Less vague.

John Rogers: so, when I…

John Rogers: I like to think, when I teach, I like to make things very vague and,

John Rogers: gray, like, we don't know, text Larry.

John Rogers: This exam, I don't think, is like that.

John Rogers: It's fairly straightforward about what

John Rogers: Okay, I got your message, a private message. You just sent me a private message, I have not forgotten about you.

John Rogers: It's… It's more straightforward black and white.

John Rogers: Then it is gray.

John Rogers: In my opinion.

dovenight: Oh, so you'll… is it like, oh, we'll see it directly, or we can go, we'll know it.

John Rogers: Yeah, it's, yeah.

John Rogers: like, I think question 2 would be fairly straightforward.

John Rogers: I think you'd be fine with it, but I think… and I think questions 1 and 3 are…

John Rogers: Kind of similar.

John Rogers: To be honest.

John Rogers: So, but I will have a review So,

John Rogers: I will have a review in this class.

John Rogers: So let's take a pause for a second.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: I will have a… I could not have a review this weekend, or this last weekend, because something… something came up.

John Rogers: But…

John Rogers: So… I told my evidence class last night, because rotten people,

John Rogers: that I would have a review this Saturday.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: And I think this is our last, technically our last class, right?

Clarissa Terrazas: Yes.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, correct.

John Rogers: Okay. So, I'm not gonna ditch you guys.

John Rogers: I'd love to. But, so I will have a review. It's optional, if… look, the sky is not falling, if you can't make it, it will be recorded.

John Rogers: on Saturday, I'll go over an essay.

John Rogers: I cannot have a optional review or any class on the 20th. I just can't. I can't do it.

John Rogers: So,

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: So, I just can't do it.

John Rogers: So I told my evidence class 21, 22nd, and 23rd.

John Rogers: So I said that I would help them, those 3 days.

John Rogers: Yes, question.

maddykoshkaryan: We don't have any makeup classes for you, right?

John Rogers: No, I think we're done. I don't think we ever missed a class. That's what I'm saying, this is the last technical class, so you don't have to come. I will email everyone the recording.

John Rogers: Everyone can get it, so if you don't… wanna… B…

John Rogers: Seeing me in real time, that's fine.

dovenight: No, I gotta see, because spending another 2 hours watching… I might pass out.

dovenight: I'm just joking.

Yessenia Soria: It's not that I don't want to see you, it's just that we have a makeup for…

Yessenia Soria: contracts this Saturday, and the review on the 22nd with the dean.

Yessenia Soria: So don't depend…

John Rogers: Really?

Yessenia Soria: We would do it, yeah.

John Rogers: that Dean, really, maybe you can ask him property questions.

maddykoshkaryan: We have 2 more makeup classes for contracts.

Yessenia Soria: No, it's just one and then Monday, right?

Yessenia Soria: Yeah, we already did one last Saturday.

maddykoshkaryan: Oh, that was the second one.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor, are you doing a class on the 15th? A review session on the 15th?

John Rogers: So this Saturday, yeah. So I'll do an hour for evidence, hour for property.

Agnes Gholoonian: And look…

John Rogers: we do.

Agnes Gholoonian: And you'll let us know for your evidence review as well, please.

John Rogers: Yeah, I did a full-fledged review and evidence last night.

John Rogers: Do you have the recording? Can you send it to me? I don't. You have to contact… you have to bother the school to get it. I don't… I have no idea how to do that.

Agnes Gholoonian: I don't mind bothering them as well.

John Rogers: But I have to have a review with you guys.

John Rogers: So, it's going to be either 21, 22,

John Rogers: and 23, and I will make myself available those 3 days for you guys, okay? So I'll do it both for evidence and property.

dovenight: Okay…

John Rogers: Okay, so.

maddykoshkaryan: Oh, you're the best.

John Rogers: And then you guys have, quote-unquote, dead week. Thanksgiving week, is that right?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: But just to clarify, you said this Saturday, and then the next thing will be 21, 22, or 23, you just don't know which one yet?

John Rogers: Yes, I have to… I want to have a review with you guys, okay?

John Rogers: So maybe it'll be, like, just 2 hours.

John Rogers: So if you can't make it, I will email it to you, and everyone should watch it.

Yessenia Soria: Okay.

John Rogers: Oh.

John Rogers: Let's go over another essay.

Yessenia Soria: Another question, Professor.

Yessenia Soria: Are you gonna, be kind enough to give us an outline for properties, too.

Yessenia Soria: Like you did for this one?

Yessenia Soria: Like, cater to us? Baby us?

Yessenia Soria: Chuji.

John Rogers: Should I?

Yessenia Soria: Let me know.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Please. Yeah, please, that'd be amazing.

John Rogers: Is long under one condition.

John Rogers: do I…

John Rogers: have full-fledged authority and consent to absolutely destroy you in front of the class if you ask me a question that's found right inside it.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yep. Yes. Absolutely.

John Rogers: I will absolutely go bananas.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): As you should.

John Rogers: Because that happened a lot this semester. And I have to, you know, hold myself in.

Yessenia Soria: We're newbies, though.

John Rogers: The second part, we're not… Are you finished?

John Rogers: I will provide it for you, but please be aware.

John Rogers: I am totally justified If you make the mistake of taking me for property 2,

John Rogers: Of going nuclear, if you ask me a question.

John Rogers: That could be found inside.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Granted.

Yessenia Soria: talk, I promise.

John Rogers: Okay, let's do question 3. And property 2, I think, is a lot harder. I don't care what you've heard.

John Rogers: Property 2, I think, is harder.

John Rogers: Or, you know what?

John Rogers: You can just ask me for the material, and take someone else.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Oh, that'd be no fun at all.

John Rogers: That would be a pretty good angle.

John Rogers: And I'm usually mean the first class. I don't know if I was mean to you guys the first class or not. Last year.

John Rogers: I was so mean the first class, half the class scattered. Ha! They're gone! They left! They said, we're not taking this guy! And the class

John Rogers: died down, and there was still, like, 70-something people in there, but… Gone.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Sounds like a great tactic, though. Remember that one.

John Rogers: Less papers to grade.

John Rogers: This is… assume a common law jurisdiction.

John Rogers: Common law applies. Common law.

dovenight: I'm sure you're so popular. Remember, popularity counts.

John Rogers: Pardon? Sorry?

dovenight: Popular when you have a lot of students?

dovenight: It was so popular.

John Rogers: That's…

John Rogers: Because I think I'm perfect. In fact, I know I am, but I just don't want to say it, because I don't want to, like, come across as being too ego and pompous, but I am.

John Rogers: God forbid.

John Rogers: The mirror tells me every morning.

John Rogers: So, assume a common law jurisdiction.

John Rogers: Okay, so when you see something like that.

John Rogers: You should never say majority, minority.

John Rogers: Never say anything like that. It's only common law that applies, okay?

John Rogers: It's only, only common law that applies, alright?

John Rogers: What interests were created by Aura's will? So that's O, Aura's will.

John Rogers: Okay… Discuss the validity of those interests. I usually, when I write a final, I usually just create those.

John Rogers: What interests, if any, does Bill have in Charmacre? This is a Michelle Tabanken question. You can find Michelle Tabanken on every social media platform. She's a wonderful woman. And just connect with her. She's really sweet.

John Rogers: She'd probably help you in property.

John Rogers: So this is a to banking question.

John Rogers: Aura is a wealthy woman who owns Charmaker. Okay, what's the first issue? FSA. P, simple, absolute, just like everything else, the foundational tells you what Aura has, and…

John Rogers: And can convey.

John Rogers: A 10-acre parcel in the countryside.

John Rogers: It's 10 acres.

John Rogers: Why not 20?

John Rogers: But 10 acres, which tells me it's gonna be 5 by 5. It's gonna be 5 and 5. 5 acres and 5 acres.

John Rogers: In the countryside.

John Rogers: In the countryside. Hmm.

John Rogers: The older I get, the more I hate people. Countryside isn't that bad.

John Rogers: The northern 5 acres, I knew it, the northern 5 acres of charm acre.

John Rogers: the northern.

John Rogers: Which means there's gonna be a Southern.

John Rogers: Which means, I assume that someone is gonna try to claim adverse possession on all of it?

John Rogers: So when I think, and I'm just thinking out loud, when I think of property that is divided, like this, north and south, east or west, I think to myself, maybe, like, a constructive possession claim, but I can't say for certain.

John Rogers: The northern 5 acres of Charmaker is improved with a 3-bedroom cottage.

John Rogers: I live there.

John Rogers: Lawns and flower gardens. I definitely didn't write this. So it's improved, okay?

John Rogers: Now, a thick stand of trees separates the northern and southern halves of Charmacre, okay?

John Rogers: This is going to what, can you tell? Can you foresee? This goes into.

Amir Akbari: Open and…

Fatima Razavi: notorious…

John Rogers: That's right, hostile. Nope, kidding. Open Notorious.

John Rogers: is this open and notorious? Okay, because you can't see something, but does that matter? Can you walk around? The southern half is undeveloped, so it's unimproved.

John Rogers: And not visible from the cottage. That still goes to Open Notorious.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: Many years ago, we don't know when, it's just many.

John Rogers: Aura… Who's very wealthy.

John Rogers: invited two sisters.

John Rogers: I… they came to… They came… I invited them, okay. Fran and Ellen.

John Rogers: I like them already.

John Rogers: To live with her as companions.

John Rogers: That's cool.

John Rogers: Fran and Ellen are not related to Aura.

John Rogers: They're just not… sisters by blood, I would assume, invited two sisters. No? Okay, maybe they're…

John Rogers: Maybe they're related to each other.

John Rogers: They're not related to Aura. That is there. I know Michelle Tobankin would write that because she doesn't want issues coming about as far as Aura dying and her successors and interest, okay?

John Rogers: Aura has one son, Sam.

John Rogers: and one grandson, Glenn.

John Rogers: Okay, Sam and Glenn.

John Rogers: Aura wants to provide both Ellen and Fran a place to live when Aura dies, so I want to support them.

John Rogers: care.

John Rogers: That's gonna be relevant.

John Rogers: However, Aura is aware that Ellen is a compulsive shopper.

John Rogers: It's like my sister.

John Rogers: And that Fran falls in love with men, that aura perceives to be unsuitable.

John Rogers: For Fran. What does that mean?

John Rogers: It's what she perceives. But okay.

John Rogers: I know what that's all about, and I think this is actually… I remember this… this is actually going to be relevant to restraint on marriage.

John Rogers: Now, we don't know that because we haven't, discussed that later in this fact pattern, as will be discussed

John Rogers: in a few paragraphs from now, but I just remember it from memory. It goes to restraint on marriage, okay?

John Rogers: Now, it's common law, so you want to remember We'll get to it.

John Rogers: But many students, historically, don't see this.

John Rogers: And this is a one-hour final, guys. This was given to students in one hour.

John Rogers: That's 35 hours less than you.

John Rogers: In January 1998, 1988.

John Rogers: You know, last night, I asked my class about the white pages and yellow pages.

John Rogers: And there was one student that didn't know what that was. Oh my god.

John Rogers: In 1988,

John Rogers: Aura, O, tells Fran and Ellen, I'm telling you that she is going to devise… so I'm gonna… I'm gonna give it to you both. Charmaker, to Fran.

John Rogers: So, I've decided I'm only gonna give it to one of you.

John Rogers: Ellen is furious because she expected to be treated the same as Fran.

John Rogers: I don't see the relevance of any of that right now. She's furious. I think that really just goes to her motivation to want to…

John Rogers: convey it as she will, but I don't think that that's a significant fact.

John Rogers: Ellen… calls Adam, On the phone?

John Rogers: who lives near Charmaker.

John Rogers: So she calls him, I'm calling you, and…

John Rogers: He lives near Charmaker. He lives near Charmaker. He lives near it.

John Rogers: I would say that would go to maybe…

John Rogers: good or bad faith on Adam's part, but that's a majority-minority view, and that's not relevant for common law.

John Rogers: So… It's kind of like, does he know she doesn't own it, or does he know she owns it?

John Rogers: Professor, would you write that… many years ago.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, would you write something about, the whole Fran, or it tells Fran and all that she's gonna devise Charmaker to Fran and say that she's getting in a present possessor interest in a life estate? No. You wouldn't write that?

John Rogers: I…

Fatima Razavi: Why?

John Rogers: going to, but I didn't.

John Rogers: That's just a mere desire to, but it's not of formal conveyance.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, so you wouldn't write anything about that in the essay?

John Rogers: I'm going one day to give you my Ferrari, and 10 million bucks, and…

John Rogers: my, mansion that I have in Bucharest.

John Rogers: Versus, I am giving to you now.

John Rogers: Bird, where was I?

John Rogers: Calls Adam, who lives near Charmaker.

John Rogers: And offers to sell him 5… the southern 5 acres of Charm Acres, southern 5 acres. Okay, the southern 5 acres.

John Rogers: Adam has been looking for some land in the neighborhood to grow organic vegetables for sale.

John Rogers: Okay… Why is that important? I don't see that being important. Adam pays \$15,000. Wow.

John Rogers: This must be in a boonies.

John Rogers: \$15,000 to Ellen.

John Rogers: who uses the money to pay off some of her credit card debt. Don't see the relevance in that. And Ellen gives Adam a deed to the southern 5 acres. Okay, so it's not constructive possession.

John Rogers: Okay? It's not constructive possession. It potentially could be raising that discussion if the deed was for all.

John Rogers: of Charmacre, but it's only for the southern 5 acres.

John Rogers: Maybe.

dovenight: Constructive? Constructive, you say constructive?

John Rogers: possession.

John Rogers: And it potentially is a fraudulent sale.

dovenight: It's definitely adverse, right, with the adverse?

John Rogers: I would assume so.

John Rogers: I mean… She doesn't own them. Can I… can I sell someone your home?

John Rogers: And they can just kind of live on.

dovenight: Probably people try, so…

John Rogers: So, in March… in March of 1988, so this happened in January 1988, this happened in March of 1988, so maybe 2 months have passed, I don't know. Maybe more.

John Rogers: Adam cultivates and fences one half… of…

John Rogers: the 5-acre and plants vegetables. What kind of vegetables are we talking about here?

John Rogers: Curious.

John Rogers: So… He begins using the land.

John Rogers: Which it becomes adverse on this date.

John Rogers: Okay, so it's common law, so there's no… not gonna be a statutory period, so it's gonna be 20 years. So we're gonna see if the statutory period has been fulfilled.

John Rogers: Because he is an adverse possessor, Adam the adverse possessor, okay?

John Rogers: In May, So that's 2 months later? Aura died. That's so sad. I'm wondering how she died.

John Rogers: I wonder if… I wonder if anyone… Got flowers? I don't know.

John Rogers: her will… So, her instrument… leaves all of her personal and real property to her son, Sam.

John Rogers: So everything is going to Sam, except…

John Rogers: So everything is going to Sam.

John Rogers: Except… The following.

John Rogers: Charmacre to Fran and her heirs. Oh.

John Rogers: as long as she remains unmarried and lives on Charmaker. Otherwise, to Glenn for life, then to Glenn's issue…

John Rogers: Who reached the age of 25.

John Rogers: Here's the problem.

John Rogers: Sam Ora has one son, Sam, and one grandson, Glenn, but it doesn't necessarily say that Glenn is the…

John Rogers: Son of Sam.

John Rogers: I didn't think of that till right now.

John Rogers: Anyways… What does Fran have here?

John Rogers: From what it looks like.

Jude Seleck: API in FSSEL.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: What does… Glenn have.

Jude Seleck: Shifting executive interests in life estate.

John Rogers: Yes…

John Rogers: And then issue.

John Rogers: What would they have?

Jude Seleck: contingents remainder.

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: Yes! Wonderful.

John Rogers: And then you could say O, maybe even S.

John Rogers: Potentially, as a reversion.

John Rogers: Now, here's the problem that I see.

John Rogers: At the time, This is common law.

John Rogers: Okay? So we don't apply U.S. wrap whatsoever.

John Rogers: But applying the common law.

John Rogers: It says then to Glenn's issue, who reached the age of 25. When you see you reach a certain age, what do we know about that?

Amir Akbari: Boy, bro.

John Rogers: Yes, it's void.

John Rogers: Now… Since Glenn has an executory interest for life, we'd have to apply RAP to that as well.

John Rogers: Done.

John Rogers: Oh, I'm sorry, I got this…

John Rogers: Wrong. Glenn's issue. Glenn's… okay, sorry, my bad.

John Rogers: What would that be? Valid or Void?

Jude Seleck: It is valid.

Jude Seleck: It's for life, so…

John Rogers: It's valid, because Glenn… Glenn's interest is not going to float around in perpetuity forever.

John Rogers: Glenn will either get it, or Glenn will not get it.

John Rogers: within Glenn's life.

John Rogers: So it's not going to be rolling around in perpetuity forever.

John Rogers: So it's valid. Now, we do see something here.

John Rogers: And it's just so…

Amir Akbari: Do we have restraint on marriage here?

John Rogers: That's what I was going to discuss.

John Rogers: What do you guys think? Should this restraint on this marriage be upheld, or do you think it should be…

John Rogers: Unlawful in any way.

John Rogers: What do you guys think?

Amir Akbari: Is it providing some kind of support?

John Rogers: Isn't, or is… And why?

Amir Akbari: I think it is.

John Rogers: Why? What's the explanation for it?

Gevorg Kulikyan: She's not restraining the marriage, she's, providing for… I forgot her name.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Until she finds someone to provide for her.

John Rogers: So, what would the, like, analysis be here?

dovenight: She said early.

Amir Akbari: She's supporting until she's unmarried. She's supporting her until she's unmarried, right?

John Rogers: Yes.

Sennett Devermont: Rather than penalizing her.

John Rogers: Yes, and what?

John Rogers: Would you guys argue is significant for this part of the discussion?

John Rogers: What would you use?

Gevorg Kulikyan: the friend and the suitable, I forgot exactly what it said, I can't… see it, but… something about…

Gevorg Kulikyan: Finding someone suitable.

Gevorg Kulikyan: that Fran falls in love with men that Aura perceives to be unsuitable for Fran.

John Rogers: Okay, so you would use that. Is there anything else you would use to support this being upheld?

Gevorg Kulikyan: The Aura wants to provide both Ellen and Fran a place to live when Aura dies, so…

John Rogers: Shows that Aura wants to provide for… Anything else?

Sennett Devermont: Is it conditioned subsequent?

Sennett Devermont: Okay, well…

John Rogers: What do you mean?

Sennett Devermont: I don't know, in your note, it says, condition subsequent as language thought to have the purpose of

Sennett Devermont: Penalizing the marriage.

John Rogers: Is that…

Sennett Devermont: isn't doing.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: But is there something before that?

dovenight: How about the unsuitable?

dovenight: She's concerned about the unsyllable minutes you might get.

John Rogers: Yeah, we talked about that.

John Rogers: I included this in my notes, guys.

Sennett Devermont: I just…

John Rogers: What's that? Go ahead.

Sennett Devermont: Well, it says durational limitations has the evidentiary value as indicative of a motive to provide support for the certain period.

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: The fact that it says as long as is words of duration.

John Rogers: So this, coupled with this, is what I would be looking for.

John Rogers: Now, you didn't teach us that! Well, one, it's in my notes, and two, I actually read it to you. I just opened up the casebook. I went to page 318.

John Rogers: 318.

John Rogers: The last paragraph on 318. A number of courts have taken the position that the purpose of the grantor can be discerned from the form of limitation. A devise…

John Rogers: 2A for life, so long as A remains unmarried, then to B, is thought to have the dominant motive of providing support until marriage, when presumably A's spouse will provide support, and not for the purpose of discouraging marriage.

Sennett Devermont: What image is that?

John Rogers: 318. I read that to you guys.

Jude Seleck: And we also used this,

Jude Seleck: phrase charmaker to Fran, and her heirs.

Jude Seleck: So… Her intent is to… not to take care of

Jude Seleck: Fran for her life, because it doesn't say charmaker to Fran for, for life, it is… and her heir, so…

Jude Seleck: That is, as long as she doesn't get married, which means that there's a restraint on marriage, actually, not to take care of her.

Jude Seleck: Otherwise, she'll just say… for life.

John Rogers: Yeah, that's an interesting point. I didn't think of that. That's interesting.

Jude Seleck: Kind of intent, showing intent.

John Rogers: Interesting.

John Rogers: That's a creative argument, to be honest, but I would say

John Rogers: I'd be impressed if you made that argument. I wasn't even thinking that, but… I think that…

John Rogers: There's other facts that support it being upheld, but I would be impressed if you… if you argue that.

John Rogers: I would say… Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, what is…

Jude Seleck: Yeah, sorry. Does Sam have a possibility of reverter here?

Jude Seleck: Should we talk about it?

John Rogers: Why would there be a possibility of reverter when there's a future interest holder, which is Glenn's executory interest?

Jude Seleck: Because, glens is for life.

Jude Seleck: So often… After him, it should go back to… there's a possibility that it can go back to…

Jude Seleck: Sam.

John Rogers: As far as what I am seeing right now.

John Rogers: Glenn hasn't died yet, or will die, I don't know yet.

Jude Seleck: So, if Glenn dies…

John Rogers: Then… before Fran, then Aura, Aura's errors, will have a possibility of reverter.

John Rogers: I don't know if he does, but the call of the question is asking what interests were created by the will.

John Rogers: So I'm measuring it at the time of creation.

Jude Seleck: Okay.

John Rogers: Nope.

John Rogers: I don't know if…

John Rogers: If this is too deep, but would this be a restraint on alienation?

John Rogers: Because if it… if it requires that… and we had a case on this.

John Rogers: It requires that she lives on Charmaker.

John Rogers: But if it requires that she lives on Charmaker, that means she can't sell it to someone.

John Rogers: Because she's required to live on it.

John Rogers: I think that's gonna be upheld.

John Rogers: You could find the case if you want.

John Rogers: I think it was the Odd Fellows case.

John Rogers: In 1992, Before many people were born in this class, Adam gives up, On his organic garden.

John Rogers: Hardy hear that.

John Rogers: He was never able to make a profit from the 2.5 acres that he had under cultivation.

John Rogers: Oh, this is really deep. Here's the thing.

John Rogers: Adam got a deed for the entire southern half.

John Rogers: But… He only used two and a half acres.

John Rogers: So that's interesting.

John Rogers: This is very complicated.

John Rogers: And I don't know how, under one hour, a one-hour final exam, how really deep you'd really get into.

John Rogers: But notice the entire deed said 7.5, but he only used two and a half.

John Rogers: There could be a color of title claim.

John Rogers: constructive possession claim here.

John Rogers: Because the defective deed that Fran gave Adam

John Rogers: She didn't own the property, so the deed was defective, and he used some of the property.

John Rogers: some of that.

John Rogers: southern half, which means that he can claim adverse possession to All of the southern half.

John Rogers: Just FYI.

John Rogers: Bill, another neighbor, hey Bill, noticed that Adam was moving his

John Rogers: gardening supplies off the land. Bill then asked Adam if he could try to make a go at it, whatever that means.

John Rogers: Adam said, good luck and drove off. We've discussed this in class. What is this?

dovenight: Efforts?

John Rogers: it's something within adverse possession. What is this?

Jude Seleck: No gravity?

John Rogers: It goes to hacking.

John Rogers: Is this tacking, where you have two adverse possess possessors that have successive periods, can you combine them to fulfill the possible 20-year period?

John Rogers: Here.

John Rogers: And here.

John Rogers: The question is, is can, and I'm jumping ahead a little bit, can…

John Rogers: Bill use Adam's time to fulfill the adverse possession period.

John Rogers: When you say open and notorious.

John Rogers: here, it's not gonna be valid, but it's worth discussing.

John Rogers: Because, obviously, the southern half is not visible from the northern half, so one could potentially claim it's not open and notorious, how am I supposed to know? But what's a reasonable inspection? Can you just peek your head through the strand? Can you walk around it? I mean, this is 5 acres on half your land.

John Rogers: But is this tacking?

John Rogers: So, in order for there to be tacking, there must be Privy.

John Rogers: Between.

John Rogers: Bill and Adam, and there's their privity.

dovenight: There's no D, there's no… But he just told them, you can have it.

John Rogers: You're right. A strong indication of…

John Rogers: Privy is some type of instrument running between the individuals, and there is none here. There's no contract, there's no deed, there's no nothing.

John Rogers: So, what is the analysis here, exactly?

John Rogers: Because… I don't… like… to read. Here, there's no privy, because there's no deed. Goodbye! I'm having a wonderful…

John Rogers: Holiday break. I think I aged property. There are no facts!

John Rogers: That they didn't have a meeting of the mind here, and there is no privy or agluent here to show that…

John Rogers: contracts term.

John Rogers: But, fine.

Mireya Gonzalez: Oh, I was gonna do the analysis, never mind.

John Rogers: Oh.

John Rogers: Go right ahead, I'm all ears.

Mireya Gonzalez: We were a possessor.

John Rogers: Yeah, she digitalized?

Mireya Gonzalez: It goes into possession.

John Rogers: Think you're digitalized.

Mireya Gonzalez: Agreed.

John Rogers: She's digitalized.

Sennett Devermont: Is it the new adverse possessor, and the clock starts ticking again, it, like, restarts?

John Rogers: Well, the question becomes is this.

John Rogers: Can't they tack their periods together?

John Rogers: So, here's the analysis.

John Rogers: Bill… Adam.

John Rogers: is leaving.

John Rogers: Packing up his stuff and leaving.

John Rogers: and would have left and had abandoned this effort, regardless of Bill Intervening or not.

John Rogers: And I think this is further supported by the fact that it says, can I try to make a Go edit? What does that even mean?

John Rogers: Good luck. So the question is, does good luck establish privy between the parties?

John Rogers: Does that constitute some type of formal transaction? Is that some type of figure of speech?

dovenight: Would you argue that it could be Kaki because he told them good luck, and…

John Rogers: You have to say it again?

dovenight: Did you argue that, yeah, it could be Takiku, so you confer that, and you told him good luck.

dovenight: Conferred that he can have the… The acre.

John Rogers: I think it would be a stretch to say that it is tacking, in my opinion.

John Rogers: When you look at the circumstances around it, they didn't shake hands or anything. There was not even discussions of what Bill would be doing.

Amir Akbari: I think we could say there is no level link or connection between two possessors for the same land, right?

John Rogers: I don't think so.

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

dovenight: Could you argue both sides?

John Rogers: Right. Fine.

dovenight: Whoa.

dovenight: You could say, one side, well, there's… it's… you know, the facts are silent, that there is no instrument, but on the other side, you could say.

dovenight: Well, he told me good luck, so give me a further day.

John Rogers: And here's the thing, when you say something like, the facts are silent as to there being an instrument.

John Rogers: If you were to write that, and I read that, I'd be, the facts are silent because there's no instrument. Well, would there be an instrument?

John Rogers: I'm gonna pack it up my stuff in a truck, I'm about to drive away, there's gonna be no instrument.

dovenight: Wow. So just…

John Rogers: Be very careful when you say no facts, or it's silent, because it's just… When I read that, red flags go into my eyes.

John Rogers: So… Just be careful, okay?

Fatima Razavi: Sorry, Professor, sir, you're saying there is no tacking?

John Rogers: I don't… I think it's a stretch, but fine, if you want to…

Fatima Razavi: What about through their conduct? Because he's now continuing the gardening.

John Rogers: It's a continuation of the garden.

John Rogers: Yeah, but, I mean, did Adam really understand that that's what was gonna happen? Can I make a go at it? I mean, making a go edit, I guess, could mean, can I take over your gardening?

Fatima Razavi: And why would they write about the gardening supplies? I mean, there's so obviously an emphasis that he had the gardening supplies, he had something to do with it, and later on.

Fatima Razavi: that seem… Fine. Job… Here's the thing.

John Rogers: In an ordinary, reasonable universe… Would you expect someone saying good luck to you

John Rogers: Is that tantamount to some type of… Real estate transaction.

Fatima Razavi: No, but he's now there, and no one's stopping him.

John Rogers: So it could be a potential, like, gift, then?

Fatima Razavi: But that's still tacking, no?

John Rogers: Sure!

Fatima Razavi: So you…

John Rogers: Is it that?

Fatima Razavi: regardless.

Fatima Razavi: Gift or no gift, the question was, is there tacky? Yeah.

John Rogers: What is hacking?

Fatima Razavi: Talking is when you have one person living somewhere, and then the amount of the adverse possessor's years, then you add the other one's years, so then you can extend so it can hit the limits of the statute.

John Rogers: And it requires privy between the parties, between adverse.

Fatima Razavi: Yes, yes.

John Rogers: is there privity? What is privy? There's no clear rule of…

Fatima Razavi: instrument, but this may be, like, implied?

Fatima Razavi: Throughout conduct.

John Rogers: I mean, I'd be careful with that.

Fatima Razavi: Okay.

John Rogers: The moment that we say conduct implies a real estate transfer is gonna be very arguable. Well, John conveyed his house to me by gift, based on his conduct. I thought it was mine!

Fatima Razavi: But nobody stopped him, either.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Look, fine, you wanna say there is tacking? I don't care. Discuss it.

John Rogers: Bill soon had the guarded making a profit within a year, blah blah blah blah blah, great for him.

John Rogers: Behind the tree line. Great.

John Rogers: So there's a… there's a huge operation going on in the southern… southern half of someone's property, and they just didn't know.

John Rogers: Now it is December 2008.

John Rogers: And Fran had just married Mike.

John Rogers: Oh, that's a problem.

John Rogers: Fran… That's not a problem, because it's upheld.

John Rogers: Good for Mike. Very happy for him.

John Rogers: Fran and Mike live on Charmaker, fine, no problem.

John Rogers: Bill is cultivating the southern 5 acres of Charmacre. Well, good for Bill.

John Rogers: Sam and Glenn are both alive. Glenn does not have any children yet, so what?

John Rogers: Doesn't mean anything to me.

John Rogers: I don't actually think that… This was actually too hard. Was this hard?

Fatima Razavi: It was really tedious.

John Rogers: Explain that to me. What do you mean, it's tedious?

Fatima Razavi: There was, like, a lot of different nuances in it that you had to catch. Like, the other ones, I feel like, are easier to understand. For this one, I found, like, you were, like, had to go back. I don't know, it was just long.

John Rogers: Issues, or just facts for issues?

Fatima Razavi: Issues.

Fatima Razavi: It was just harder. I… for me, this is probably the hardest essay we've had, in my opinion.

John Rogers: Okay.

dovenight: Can we get a copy of that essay?

John Rogers: You can get a copy.

John Rogers: Someone had an explanation, hold on.

John Rogers: The last paragraph clears up that Glenn, Sam and Glenn are both alive. Glenn does not have any children yet.

John Rogers: How does it… Clear that up.

John Rogers: But I said, is Glenn Sam's kid?

John Rogers: That's what I asked.

John Rogers: Okay…

John Rogers: So I'll drop this.

John Rogers: in the… Chat now.

John Rogers: You guys wanna take a break?

John Rogers: You guys all need to rest your eyes, you guys have been looking at your phone too much. So, rest your eyes.

John Rogers: Take a break.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, can I ask you a question, please?

John Rogers: You may.

Fatima Razavi: It was in the chat as well, just to make sure I understand. So, when you say there's an improved parcel of land.

Fatima Razavi: how does that affect adverse possession? So, it's either they maintain the land, and… or they improve it. That's the only time they can, like, adversely possess the land?

John Rogers: Say it again?

Fatima Razavi: Why it is important… I guess here's the… I'll just ask a better question.

Fatima Razavi: Why is it important that you highlight, oh, look, this land has been improved? What's the significance of that?

John Rogers: Because… You have to actually occupy land.

John Rogers: How does someone really know that someone's a trespasser unless they're really occupying it?

John Rogers: Improving it in some way.

Fatima Razavi: So if it was just land you didn't own… I mean, you owned, but it was just barren and stuff, and someone decided to just live there.

Fatima Razavi: You would still know, because it's your land.

Fatima Razavi: Maybe you have cameras on it.

John Rogers: Maybe you don't.

Fatima Razavi: I just don't know how improvement is such a big factor.

John Rogers: It's not necessarily improved, but also maintain. Are you using the land like a reasonable owner would?

Fatima Razavi: And what if you're not, you just have cameras?

John Rogers: You just really want to save, like, the… I'm just… Hold on, so you're the true owner, what is on the land? So, wait a sec, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

John Rogers: There's an unimproved piece of land, and you say cameras.

John Rogers: Who put cameras on the land?

Fatima Razavi: Because I just don't want people to…

John Rogers: Who… no, no, no, no, no, no. Who put cameras.

Fatima Razavi: The owners, the owners, the owners of the land.

John Rogers: True owner did.

Fatima Razavi: Tree owner, yes.

John Rogers: So, it's a… Blank piece of land that the owner put cameras on.

John Rogers: Then what about it?

Fatima Razavi: So… People can still… try to…

Fatima Razavi: You know, take over versus possess that land.

Fatima Razavi: It doesn't need to be improved, so why do we…

John Rogers: So it does not need to be improved.

Fatima Razavi: Maybe everyone's just a hippie.

Fatima Razavi: And they all just want to be in, like, nature.

John Rogers: We did have a case on this about… Sufficiently improved land.

John Rogers: Because all the elements kind of coincide with each other.

John Rogers: So are you truly an adverse possessor here if you're not using the land like a reasonable owner would?

John Rogers: You just want a sleeping bag on a 5-acre parcel?

Fatima Razavi: So then you're just trespassing.

John Rogers: It would be a trespass, I just don't think that that occupancy would suffice and be sufficient for.

John Rogers: Actual.

John Rogers: Occupancy for an adverse possession claim.

Fatima Razavi: So if it's unimproved land, And the person comes in and improves it.

Fatima Razavi: That would be adverse possession.

John Rogers: We'll certainly would satisfy the first… Requirement of actual occupancy.

Fatima Razavi: And if it's improved land, Then it's because it's habitable.

John Rogers: Sure. But… sure.

John Rogers: I mean, I don't necessarily think that habitability is required, because you can… have… like a business.

John Rogers: That may… a business may not be, like, a habitable place, but it's certainly an improvement. It's a structure.

John Rogers: And it's being occupied.

Fatima Razavi: Okay.

Fatima Razavi: Thank you.

Amir Akbari: I think the unimproved land is more triggering something, right? On our assays, and most of the time, when we see the unimproved one, it's gonna help us to see if the

Amir Akbari: Possessor, improve the land later, then that's gonna go to the, adverse position, actual, right?

Amir Akbari: It's gonna help us to… yeah. But improved, I didn't see…

Amir Akbari: Thank you, yeah, that was my question, because…

dovenight: Rogers, can I answer one question?

dovenight: For adverse possession, common law is 20 years.

dovenight: My ex was moderately.

dovenight: It's my…

John Rogers: Ron, in the last 20 years.

John Rogers: Modernly, is determined by jurisdiction. Statute.

dovenight: Okay, thank you.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, so in this, essay. The interest that Bill has, he's still an adverse possessor.

Gevorg Kulikyan: But he's still in the process of being an adverse possessor, it's not complete yet.

John Rogers: Yeah, I mean, I would… I mean, if I was a student, I was writing, I would say it was insufficient. I'd say that… that he didn't fulfill the…

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Period of adverse possession, because, of the… privy tacking issue with Adam.

Gevorg Kulikyan: But it's still… he's still cultivating the land, so it's still in the process. He could eventually become an adverse possessor.

Gevorg Kulikyan: But nothing says that. Something came in between him.

Gevorg Kulikyan: At the end.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Like, he didn't get kicked off or anything.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Right. So, for his interest, when it says, what interest does Bill have, do we just write that he's still an adverse possessor?

Gevorg Kulikyan: in the process.

John Rogers: Fine.

John Rogers: I mean, look, here's the thing.

John Rogers: In the term of year's discussion, you're gonna say whether or not

John Rogers: Bill satisfy the stat… the… the term… the term of years period?

John Rogers: And if he's not satisfied, then, hey, there's… cannot claim adverse possession.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Cool.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Then…

Gevorg Kulikyan: And Bill would be adversely possessing against the true owners, not, what's his face?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Adam.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Right.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Because Adam was never…

John Rogers: an owner.

John Rogers: Bill.

John Rogers: Would be adversely possessing against Baran.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Friend.

John Rogers: But I'll mention to the class.

John Rogers: You cannot adversely possess a future interest holder.

John Rogers: That's in my notes.

John Rogers: Look in the… in the purple highlighted part.

John Rogers: So, if any reason, if Glenn got it…

John Rogers: The clock would start all over again.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: I'll mention that device.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Cool.

John Rogers: That's in my notes.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Thank you, Professor.

John Rogers: Can anyone tell me when we went on break? I had to give you 15 minutes. Is it 5… has it been 10 minutes so far?

John Rogers: It's been at least 7.

Yessenia Soria: I think it was 8.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I think, yeah.

Yessenia Soria: Thank you, Lena's at 8.05.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah.

Tamara Baghdasaryan: That's right.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, I have a quick question.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Where did it go?

Gevorg Kulikyan: So sorry. When it says,

Gevorg Kulikyan: Otherwise, to Glenn for life than to Glenn's issue who reached the age of 25.

Gevorg Kulikyan: since it's… Issue reaches the age of 25, we don't bring up Shelly's rule.

John Rogers: It doesn't say airs.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: Doesn't say errors.

Gevorg Kulikyan: But if it said heirs, we would still bring it up, even though it says who reached 25?

John Rogers: Good question.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Because that's not, like, the same interest.

John Rogers: I don't think that that would be the same, because it's too… it's contingent remainder, but…

John Rogers: There's a condition that must be fulfilled, so it wouldn't merge the two estates together.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

Amir Akbari: I also have a question where it's… when Frank gets married, does it?

Amir Akbari: Boom.

Amir Akbari: Getting a… anything com…

Amir Akbari: after that, because there is a condition on the front, right? And if she doesn't… it's not ambiguous. If she doesn't get married, how's she gonna have heirs?

John Rogers: I'm not following.

Amir Akbari: It's, there's a condition, it says, Fran and her heirs, as long as she remain unmarried and lives on…

Amir Akbari: But when she gets, if she,

Amir Akbari: doesn't get married, how she can have a…

John Rogers: Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

John Rogers: Whoa, you're right.

John Rogers: You're correct.

John Rogers: I miss that.

John Rogers: Hold on a second.

John Rogers: You're right.

John Rogers: You are right. Hold on a second.

Leanna Badar: But can't her heirs be, like, her sib… her siblings or other people? It doesn't have to be her children as heirs?

John Rogers: Heirs are not necessarily children.

John Rogers: It's a complicated issue, and you'll learn all about that in wills, trusts, and estates.

John Rogers: Let me see something right here, because, yeah, I think I… Boom.

John Rogers: Maybe the second time in my life, screwed up.

John Rogers: Okay, because for some reason, I was thinking it was not upheld.

John Rogers: Or it was Void or something, I'm not sure, but yeah, you sit here, now it is December, Fran has just married Mike.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So there's a breach.

John Rogers: Pay very close attention, okay?

John Rogers: I want you to pay very close attention to this.

John Rogers: Maybe one day you'll thank me.

John Rogers: In fact, I almost guarantee you'll thank me.

John Rogers: I guarantee you'll thank me.

John Rogers: If…

John Rogers: Bill.

John Rogers: succeeded to adversely possessing Fran.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: The problem is this.

John Rogers: As a general rule, you cannot… an adverse possessor cannot…

John Rogers: Adversely possess a future interest holder.

John Rogers: So, if there's a breach here.

John Rogers: This is what's complicated.

John Rogers: If there's a breach… Glenn.

John Rogers: kicks in.

John Rogers: Thank you for catching this.

John Rogers: If there's a breach now…

John Rogers: That means Glenn gets it.

John Rogers: You with me so far?

John Rogers: If that happens… the clock.

John Rogers: starts over again.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: And in, for some miracle, Someone adversely possesses Glenn.

John Rogers: For 20 years.

John Rogers: They can only adversely possess it for Glenn's life.

John Rogers: Because eventually, it will go back to O when Glenn dies.

John Rogers: And then… It starts all over again.

John Rogers: So… Let me recap this.

John Rogers: There was a breach in 2018 because Fran got married.

John Rogers: Let's say… Bill succeeded to adverse possession.

John Rogers: Bill can only succeed to Fran's interest.

John Rogers: But once there's a breach, Bill… Bill cannot… adversely possess.

John Rogers: Glenn.

John Rogers: In my notes, in…

John Rogers: In my notes, at the very end of the adverse possession discussion, in those notes, there's gonna be highlighted portion in purple.

John Rogers: Maybe, like, a different, like, a purple-pink?

John Rogers: I think it, it's like, it's like this kind of color.

John Rogers: That's purple.

John Rogers: it will say… An adverse possessor

John Rogers: if they were to succeed, does not adversely possess a future interest holder, and that's a general rule.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So technically speaking, Thank you for catching this.

John Rogers: The adverse possession clock starts all over again once Glenn becomes the present interest holder.

dovenight: You say 2018, it said 2008.

John Rogers: Yeah, 2008. Some people have problems reading, and I'm one of those people. And then 2008.

John Rogers: So, as a general rule.

John Rogers: This is something you have to con- tonight. Tonight.

John Rogers: After class.

John Rogers: you contact… Your tattoo artist.

John Rogers: You contact them.

John Rogers: And you go to their shop, or maybe they'll do a house call.

John Rogers: And they come over.

John Rogers: And they open up your skull and your brain, and they tattoo this to your brain.

John Rogers: Adverse possessor cannot adversely possess a future interest holder.

John Rogers: Got it.

John Rogers: Don't say I didn't… warn you.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Now, I will amend this.

John Rogers: And there you go.

John Rogers: Good catch. I was wrong.

John Rogers: I was wrong.

John Rogers: for… Maybe once in my life I was wrong.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Then consider yourself lucky, because that's great.

Amir Akbari: You're always right.

John Rogers: I'm usually always right.

John Rogers: Any other ones you want to go over? Let's go over another one.

John Rogers: Or maybe we could just do some problems, whatever you guys want to do.

Amir Akbari: Do another comments, let's see?

John Rogers: You wanna do a landlord-tenant?

Amir Akbari: I don't think so.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Conveyance, if possible.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Tell me which one you want to do, and we'll do it.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: The one that looks like the final.

John Rogers: You're not gonna find very many of those, alright?

John Rogers: I'm telling you, you're not gonna find very many.

Agnes Gholoonian: Is landlord-tenant on the final?

John Rogers: I can't say that it is, and I'm not gonna say that it's not.

Agnes Gholoonian: Because you brought it up twice.

John Rogers: Well… I mean, yeah, I'd like to do… I mean, we haven't done a lot of landlord-tenant Hi, Buzz.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I love it.

John Rogers: So…

Agnes Gholoonian: I think we should do a landlord-tenant.

Yessenia Soria: Me too.

John Rogers: Someone wants to… someone asked me about constructive possession, so you asked me about constructive possession for adverse possession?

John Rogers: Is that what you're asking?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, I think that was a question that had gotten brought up last session.

John Rogers: Okay, constructive position. Someone clarified. It was… it's a private message.

John Rogers: Let me also know about constructive possession.

John Rogers: the… Cardinal rule.

John Rogers: is that.

John Rogers: An adverse possessor can only succeed to adverse possession of a parcel of what they are actually using.

John Rogers: Whatever they are actually using.

John Rogers: So, if they're only using

John Rogers: The corner part of the property, they can only succeed to adverse possession under that corner part.

John Rogers: A way to get around that, though, is that…

John Rogers: If the individual enters the parcel under color of title, meaning they accepted a deed purporting to convey title, but it was defective.

John Rogers: So they're entering under the color Of them having full title.

John Rogers: Caller of title.

John Rogers: And the second part of that discussion requires them to use some of the parcel. They don't have to use all of it, just some.

John Rogers: So if they use SUM, And entered through a defective deed.

John Rogers: Purporting to convey title of all the property.

John Rogers: they can succeed to ALL of the premises, even though they only actually used a small portion.

dovenight: For example, so you're saying that they transact on one little part, and… Color title.

dovenight: If they do it right, they can succeed, too. All of the…

John Rogers: If they do it right, what do you mean?

dovenight: I mean, they…

dovenight: They have a defective feed, and they track off of the usage. For a certain time, they can secede to the entire…

dovenight: Possession?

dovenight: I may be missing. Right.

John Rogers: That's right, I agree with you.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: There's question 18 on the essays, I don't know if that's potentially a good one. It has the conveyance and…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: It also has, adverse possession and a joint tenancy, I think?

John Rogers: Dude.

John Rogers: Didn't we go over this one?

John Rogers: Didn't we go over question 18?

John Rogers: I feel like we did.

John Rogers: Can someone confirm if we did or not?

John Rogers: I seem to think that we did.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I think we did 17, but I think Mariah had one last week or the week before.

John Rogers: I know who you're referring to, I just don't think that's her… the pronunciation of her name, but,

John Rogers: did… we did 17? I feel like we did 18, but a lot of this… these types of questions that you're looking at are just recycled, just changed the facts, so…

John Rogers: But.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I don't have 18 down in my, any of our notes we've done

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): in any of the classes that I've been in with you. It might have been done in one of the classes I missed, but I don't have it down. But it is very… it does read very similar to other ones, for sure. It seems familiar.

John Rogers: No, okay, fine, we can do it.

John Rogers: You wanna do it? Is there any opposition?

John Rogers: Any opposition to doing question 18, 1-8, Fall 2017 Final Exam?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Rock on?

John Rogers: Fall 2017.

John Rogers: I remember that class. One of the worst classes I've ever had in my life.

John Rogers: One of the worst.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): What made it bad?

John Rogers: It was a big class.

John Rogers: Remember the big class. Really big.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, that's gotta be frustrating.

John Rogers: Yeah, it was just a little too big for me.

dovenight: Was it all the grading?

John Rogers: Brady? Oh, Grady? Yeah, yeah, too. Yes, yes, I'll be Brady, maybe. Very mad.

John Rogers: There was a student I had in there, and she was very smart.

John Rogers: And I think she told me she got an A in the class, but I used to play chess with her while I was teaching.

John Rogers: Because I've been playing that game since I was a kid, so I can play in my head, and I'd play her while I was teaching.

John Rogers: And she was really good. She was Russian, so she could play.

John Rogers: But I remember that class.

John Rogers: She was so bored of this class. She was so bored.

John Rogers: But she was very smart.

John Rogers: One of the smartest I've had.

John Rogers: Bored.

John Rogers: Yeah, she's bored.

John Rogers: That's probably how I would recognize it then, if you wrote me that private message. That's probably how I'd recognize it then.

John Rogers: So let's go over it.

John Rogers: Well, right, title, interest, and Blackacre. If any, does Andy… did Andy initially convey to Beth, Chris, and Dahlia?

John Rogers: I kinda like that name.

John Rogers: What interests, if any, did Andy have as a result of the conveyance?

John Rogers: Discuss. I understand that.

John Rogers: What right, or rights, you should say, title, or interest, or interests in Blackacre, if any, are held by Andy, Chris, and Edward? Who's Ed? Discuss.

John Rogers: Blah blah blah.

John Rogers: A owned Blackacre and Fee Simple Absolute. What's the first issue? It's just FSA.

John Rogers: In 1975, that was a…

John Rogers: Probably a long time ago.

John Rogers: Andy, by written deed.

John Rogers: Written deeds.

John Rogers: By written deed, yeah, I guess it could be oral transfers we'll learn next semester, if you make this… make the mistake of taking me.

John Rogers: Andy, by written deed, conveyed Blackacre to Beth, Chris, and Dahlia.

John Rogers: So there's 3 people.

John Rogers: Okay? Three people.

John Rogers: PCD.

John Rogers: Jointly with a right of survivorship.

John Rogers: So…

Fatima Razavi: Showing tenancy?

John Rogers: Okay, yeah, so the analysis… is…

John Rogers: Is there specific language evidencing Andy's intent to convey?

John Rogers: a joint tenancy.

Fatima Razavi: Right of survivorship.

John Rogers: Yeah, and then jointly establishes some type of co-tenancy involved, but the survivorship language evidences Andy's intent to award full survivorship interests

John Rogers: 100% interest.

John Rogers: To the survivor, last remaining survivor, Beth, Chris, and Dahlia. Or Dahlia.

John Rogers: Each then have… What, 33.3333% interest.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: The deed further provided… this is interesting.

John Rogers: Or further provides. This is interesting. This is very, very, very interesting.

John Rogers: But if Blackacre, or any portion of Blackacre, is used

John Rogers: No, it's not interesting. Used to cons… Doom… or sell alcohol.

John Rogers: Andy shall have the right to immediately re-enter and repossess Blackhinker.

John Rogers: Who's that look like?

Amir Akbari: Is that it?

Amir Akbari: And subject to subsequent, condition subsequent…

dovenight: Right.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: be simple subject to a condition subsequent, then what does Andy have?

Amir Akbari: Right of entry.

John Rogers: Right.

John Rogers: Used.

John Rogers: In 1976, so maybe a day later, a month later, a year later, who knows?

John Rogers: Beth opened up a small bar on Blackacre.

John Rogers: You just effed it up for everyone.

John Rogers: But… It's not an automatic forfeiture.

John Rogers: So adverse possession does not begin to tick until Andy or Andy's heirs, whoever the right of entry holder is.

John Rogers: Decides to exercise the right to enter.

John Rogers: So there's potential breach here.

John Rogers: Looks like it. A bar. Well, I mean, it could be a water bar.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Yeah, a water bar. Yeah, a water bar.

John Rogers: God, jeez. I should just… I should just come up with a water bar. That's hose water, that's tap water from the hose, and that's, that's water from my shower.

John Rogers: And then just sell that, and just not tell anyone, and make a lot of money.

John Rogers: In 1980, No, I'm getting confused with the dates, but in 1980, okay?

John Rogers: Dahlia… gets nervous.

John Rogers: gets nervous.

John Rogers: Why not just say, is nervous?

John Rogers: gets nervous.

John Rogers: that Beth is selling alcohol.

John Rogers: Okay, so Dahlia conveys her interest to Edward, okay.

John Rogers: I'm nervous.

John Rogers: severance of the joint tenancy. With respect to Dahlia's interest.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So that looks like a joint tenancy severance.

John Rogers: So, Edward would be… Edward has 33…

John Rogers: In tenants in common, with… B… and seat.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: while B… and C each have a combined 66…

John Rogers: 6% interest in joint tenancy still.

John Rogers: Got it?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I have a question here.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Sorry. Go ahead, whoever that was.

Fatima Razavi: No, no, you go ahead, I'll ask afterwards, I apologize.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Very good. My question is, when you get to that joint tenancy severance, can you talk about the discussion that it's severed in the formation of the tenants in common, or would you just discuss that and then move on to that, now there are tenants in common?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: you should.

John Rogers: formation of tenants?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Well, they become tenants in common with the new guy.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Which would be Edward.

John Rogers: I mean, I don't know Edward's pronouns, but okay. .

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Like, can we say a joint tends to be severed by conveying the property to oneself and another, then, say, see info for discussion?

John Rogers: you could say that, or you can keep it one or two sentences, and simply say that Dahlia sold her interest

John Rogers: in… Blackacre to Edward, and consequently.

John Rogers: severed her interest, which makes Edward, tenants in common, with… B and C.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Got it, okay.

John Rogers: I'll keep track of the percentage interest, I used to tell my class before that, 33% interest.

John Rogers: So, keep track of the math.

John Rogers: Notice here, I used to teach.

John Rogers: joint tenancy creation. I used to teach it.

John Rogers: requiring time, title, interest, and possession, I don't do that anymore. Okay, because modern law applies that it's not… that the four unities is not required, so I just stopped requiring that. So if you look at prior essays that I've given you.

John Rogers: If you've bothered to look at them.

John Rogers: You'll notice that many of the students write time, title, interest, and possession, and it's because I required it, but I don't require it anymore.

John Rogers: Unless it's common law.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, when Beth… when Beth breaches, does everyone lose?

John Rogers: their interests, or what happens there? It's not automatic.

Fatima Razavi: Of all, if… Unless, yeah, and he chooses to re-enter.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Fatima Razavi: Bellasus states that, we assume that Everyone still has interest.

John Rogers: Yeah?

John Rogers: It wasn't exercised.

dovenight: So… Andy has to re-enter… had to choose to re-enter first before it can breach.

John Rogers: Andy's gotta come on the property and say, get off. And that hasn't happened.

Fatima Razavi: And if he does do that, everyone loses.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, so it's not just Beth.

John Rogers: it's not just Beth.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: But that's when… that's the point of when it becomes adverse.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: When you say don't talk about… Oh, sorry.

John Rogers: Go ahead.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I was just saying, when you say don't talk about time, title, interest, and possession, you just don't… you just delete that out of it, you don't even talk about it at all, you don't even mention it, that…

John Rogers: It's not required modernly. It's just specific language of the grantor's intent to create a… A joint tenancy.

Leanna Badar: But under common law, we would talk about those, like, as separate Analysis? Like, the four Unities?

John Rogers: That is correct. Liana, I just… I just… I think you have a beautiful voice. I really wish I could just hear it, like, more often in class.

John Rogers: I think everyone agrees… But yes, you are correct. If it's common law.

John Rogers: You discuss the four unities, because that's how it's created.

dovenight: Modernally, we don't.

dovenight: But if it doesn't… if it say… if it doesn't say modern or common law, should we discuss the four, unities?

John Rogers: Rarely is there an exam given that says discuss common law and modern. I think that's too much of a…

John Rogers: Of a mind twist, in my opinion.

John Rogers: Yes, 1975 is pre-iPhone, but still, there's… Vehicles, and skyscrapers, and…

John Rogers: you know, computers, so I'd still apply modern law here, okay?

dovenight: My mother-in-law, so we don't have to discuss those four parts.

John Rogers: I mean, unless you can think of someone maybe getting on the Mayflower, it's probably still gonna be Modern Law.

dovenight: Okay.

Yessenia Soria: Professor, can there be, statue of fraud also here?

Yessenia Soria: On the first paragraph.

John Rogers: Statute of frauds. Why did you say that?

Yessenia Soria: Because there's a written deed conveying Black Acre.

Yessenia Soria: to Beth, Chris, and Dahlia.

John Rogers: So why are you write… why are you writing Statute of frauds? Why… what…

Yessenia Soria: Because it's right here, it's a one-year provision.

Yessenia Soria: Huh?

John Rogers: What caused you to say Statute of frauds?

Yessenia Soria: Because there's a one-year provision, at least from where you'll be writing to be enforceable.

John Rogers: Where's the lease?

Yessenia Soria: Oh.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: But it also says sale or transfer of real property.

Yessenia Soria: So I would figure it.

John Rogers: I can go back to about 3 weeks ago, when I said it's a big second semester issue.

John Rogers: I…

Yessenia Soria: Sorry, I'm going based on your outline, okay?

John Rogers: I'm gonna still talk about it. It's a second semester issue. I do teach it second semester. And since it's taught in contracts second semester.

John Rogers: I don't typically, unless it's landlord-tenant, like to test beyond the one-year provision, because not everyone has completed contracts.

John Rogers: So I don't typically test it. And I said before that students usually sometimes discuss it within their essay. That's fine. I do not require it, I never make it a required issue. First semester property.

John Rogers: Going back, in 1982, Chris drafted a will.

John Rogers: I wrote a will.

Fatima Razavi: Rividity?

John Rogers: I wrote a will.

John Rogers: and devised his interest in Blackacre to Frank.

John Rogers: What is that?

Jude Seleck: Will has no effect.

John Rogers: Why?

Jude Seleck: Because of,

Jude Seleck: I mean…

Amir Akbari: That's unaccertain.

John Rogers: No.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Joint tenancy, you can't do that.

John Rogers: Correct. That's when the person dies. I think that's what Jude was.

Jude Seleck: Arrival shit, yeah.

John Rogers: That is correct. So, would no severance.

dovenight: There's no severance unless he died.

John Rogers: He died here, next year, oh, he died! Oh, God! But here's the problem.

John Rogers: Chris died… Before Beth.

John Rogers: So, wait a second.

John Rogers: Beth?

John Rogers: gets Chris's 33%, which means Beth has 66% interest. This is nothing but just pixels on your screen, has no legal significance. If you took a real-life final exam, this would be in person, and this is nothing more than ink.

John Rogers: Has no legal significance.

dovenight: Yeah, you're right.

dovenight: Yeah.

dovenight: He has to sell it while he's alive.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: So it's no joint tenancy severance.

John Rogers: this would not constitute a severance. So, as it stands here, the state of Blackacre is 66% is Beth's

John Rogers: And 33% is Edward, right?

John Rogers: In Tenants in common.

John Rogers: Yes.

Amir Akbari: And so, when we succeed here, it's gonna convert to the talent in common, right?

John Rogers: Yeah, I just set a tennis in common right here.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, yeah, just want to make sure, because I have a problem with that. Thank you. Yeah, I know, but if there is two, like, joint tenant, it shouldn't be tenant in common until the joint tenancy, someone succeeds on that route.

John Rogers: Repeat that?

Amir Akbari: If there is a joint tenancy, and there is another person, tenant in common, that doesn't mean they have a tenant… the whole thing is not tenant in common, right?

John Rogers: Right, F…

Amir Akbari: Yeah, after the, joint tenant, one of them is succeed, now the remaining one, like, two of them, it's gonna be tenant in common, right? The same thing as here.

John Rogers: I think so?

John Rogers: I would just follow exactly what happened here. I might just give.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, that's… yeah, that's… that's… thank you.

John Rogers: Because the 33% and 33% interest in joint tenancy was with B and C.

John Rogers: So once C died, B gets all that interest.

John Rogers: Are there any other questions?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: In 1984,

John Rogers: Man, there are a lot of dates going on here, which I don't like. I didn't actually write this. My former counterpart, who used to teach this class with me,

John Rogers: Modified an exam and just gave it out.

John Rogers: So I didn't actually write this, but whatever.

John Rogers: I don't know why I put a bunch of dates on it.

John Rogers: In 1984, There's been a lot of teachers that taught property.

John Rogers: I'm still going. In 1984, Andy learned… that…

John Rogers: Beth had started selling alcohol at Blackacre. So that's when he learned.

John Rogers: Okay, Andy took no further action.

John Rogers: So, so far… Beth's interest is not adverse.

John Rogers: She's not adversely possessing Andy, at this point.

John Rogers: In 1985,

John Rogers: docking the DeLorean, man.

John Rogers: 1985.

John Rogers: Frank… moved… into Blackacre. I think it should say onto, not into.

John Rogers: Because into means you're inside, But okay… into Blackacre.

John Rogers: Who's Frank?

John Rogers: Who's Frank? Some guy, alright. Some guy…

John Rogers: Some guy, alright, just goes on Blackacre, okay? Some guy, heh, who's not mentioned, some guy.

John Rogers: goes on to Blackacre, alright?

John Rogers: he… was… The only party Is this a typo? Actually living on Blackie?

John Rogers: the only party A party of what? I'm assuming in a lawsuit party?

John Rogers: What is that about? Living on Black, so he's living on… so there's some actual occupancy.

John Rogers: Fine.

John Rogers: So is he… I think he's adversely possessing.

John Rogers: Beth and Edward, then.

John Rogers: Frank did not hide that he was living there.

John Rogers: Frank the Bunny.

Fatima Razavi: Is that Sugar, like, open and notorious or something like that? Because he's, like, out in the public.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Well, I would assume a guy dressed in a bunny outfit is open and notorious.

John Rogers: I don't think people got that.

John Rogers: Frank did not hide that he was living there, okay? So… Edward and Beth approach Frank.

John Rogers: And Frank declares that he's the sole owner of Blackacre.

John Rogers: posted no trespassing signs on Blackacre. He then changed the locks, he also paid all the expense, so he's just an adverse possessor. So all Frank is doing is just some guy who comes out of nowhere

John Rogers: and just starts adversely possessing Blackacre against… Beth and Edward.

John Rogers: That's all it is.

Fatima Razavi: Adverse processes can't do ousting, right?

John Rogers: Well, he's not.

John Rogers: a co-tenant.

Fatima Razavi: That's what I'm saying. Let's… he doesn't have…

John Rogers: Adversely possessing two people.

Sennett Devermont: It's hostile?

John Rogers: Well, certainly, you can establish hostel, because…

John Rogers: So here's the thing. This guy comes out of nowhere, so Ed and Beth approach Frank. He just says, I'm the owner.

John Rogers: Okay, this is just coming out of nowhere. Alright.

John Rogers: I kind of like Frank.

John Rogers: He posted no trespassing signs, which is an indication that

John Rogers: He's excluding anyone but himself, so it's exclusive.

John Rogers: He declares he's the sole owner, so I think that collectively could establish

John Rogers: It's without consent, I would assume.

dovenight: You can discuss Alster, but fail it.

John Rogers: I don't see a need to discuss ouster, because he's not a co-tenant.

John Rogers: He's not a co-tenant.

John Rogers: In 1997, so maybe 12 years later, maybe?

John Rogers: Edward?

John Rogers: and Beth… brought an action against Frank for trespass.

John Rogers: Statue's 10 years.

Fatima Razavi: Frank owns it.

John Rogers: I think Frank wins. I think… It's a… I think it's a touchdown.

dovenight: Oh, we were right there, Frank.

dovenight: Well, when, or adverse possession, or something.

John Rogers: The problem, though… is that…

John Rogers: Selling alcohol on… look, I'm just thinking out loud, but selling alcohol… so what happened with best selling alcohol on Blackacre?

John Rogers: I'm not sure I'm understanding that. What did she just, like…

John Rogers: stop doing that? She has a bar!

Fatima Razavi: Well, it says in 1984, Andy learned that Beth had started selling alcohol and decided to do nothing about it, so you're probably just gonna talk about reentry and that he didn't exercise.

John Rogers: Yes, so Frank just moved on and lived in the bar.

John Rogers: I don't know. I don't know. So,

John Rogers: like I said, this was a modification of an exam, so…

John Rogers: Looks like there's kind of a… A big hole.

John Rogers: but it looks… like Frank could potentially succeed to adverse possession here.

John Rogers: Was it shared?

John Rogers: He changed the locks?

John Rogers: Doesn't appear to be shared.

John Rogers: he expressly told Beth and Chris that they have no interest, so that… Plus him living there.

John Rogers: Changing the locks, and no trespassing sides all collectively show notice for open and notorious.

dovenight: And it took them 12 years…

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: So I don't… I mean, was this hard? This is not very hard. It's just kind of like a… like, Frank just came out of nowhere.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Does Andy still have his right for,

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Even though he didn't do anything about it now, can he still…

John Rogers: I… disagree… In this instance.

John Rogers: And it's a good question.

John Rogers: Andy is a future interest holder because he holds a right of entry.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: The problem, though… Is that… Had?

John Rogers: Beth or Edward adversely possessed it?

John Rogers: once…

John Rogers: I guess Andy would have to initially exercise his interest.

John Rogers: for it to be adverse, before it could be against Andy.

John Rogers: So I would think that… If the adverse possession is against Edward and Beth.

John Rogers: then Frank would succeed, but if Andy

John Rogers: exercises his right of entry, then I think the adverse possession clock would then re-tick them, because it's now adversely possessing Andy.

dovenight: Oh, so, despite that Andy took over the action in 84, but he decided in 97,

dovenight: Oh, I'm gonna re-enter.

dovenight: If Andy did, I would think that the…

John Rogers: that… that Frank succeeded to adverse possession against Edward Beth in their interest.

John Rogers: But it then changes if Andy exercises his right of reentry, because now it's against Andy.

John Rogers: That would make sense to me.

dovenight: Andy.

dovenight: enters, Frank would be at adverse possession, Andy would.

John Rogers: Yes, correct.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You said here there's no ouster because they're not co-tenants?

John Rogers: Yeah, Frank is not a co-tenant.

John Rogers: He's not a tenants in common, joint tenants, nothing. He's just some guy that came out of nowhere.

Fatima Razavi: Isn't there another type of outstanding? Or is it only that type?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Oh, weird.

John Rogers: The only ouster that I told you guys is the… Is between co-tenants.

Fatima Razavi: So there's no Austrian adverse possession.

John Rogers: And there is no ouster in adverse possession?

Fatima Razavi: Yeah, there isn't, like, if you have adverse possession like we're having right now, there's no officer.

John Rogers: I mean, I guess…

John Rogers: There is verbiage that says excluding someone from the property is an ouster, in which case you could say no trespassing signs, he's ousting any other person other than himself from the property.

John Rogers: But an ouster of what I taught you.

John Rogers: is… An issue among co-tenants.

John Rogers: Got that?

Sennett Devermont: Wait, I had a quick question. The… if Andy were to kick off or use his right of entry and say, you know, you can't be here because of the alcohol.

Sennett Devermont: And then that would start the adverse possession there. Would the… would tacking be involved when then Frank comes?

Sennett Devermont: Or it's two separate adverse possessions.

John Rogers: Well, there would not be… I just think it would be hard to find privity between

John Rogers: the co-tenants and Frank.

John Rogers: That would be a bit of a problem.

Sennett Devermont: Okay, I see that.

John Rogers: Frank just comes out of nowhere, comes out of left field, says, I'm here.

John Rogers: I'm taking over.

dovenight: Can we get that paper?

John Rogers: You can get it.

John Rogers: I'll give it to you.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, quick question about the final. How many pages is it going to be in total?

John Rogers: You know, that is a very good question.

John Rogers: A very good question, give me a second.

John Rogers: That is a very, very good question.

John Rogers: And in question 18 notes, which I'll give you guys right now.

John Rogers: I didn't make any notes as far as adverse possession and stuff, so just keep that in mind, but it is required.

John Rogers: An adverse possession discussion.

John Rogers: I just dropped it in the chat.

John Rogers: Let me see real quick, hold on.

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: I think I spotted this before, and I forgot to clarify it.

John Rogers: the way that it's written, I don't know. It needs to be clarified.

John Rogers: I will contact my colleague tonight to get that clarified, and I'll let you guys know.

John Rogers: Saturday.

John Rogers: If you can't make it Saturday, no problem. You can just always listen to the recording.

John Rogers: So we went over 3 essays tonight.

John Rogers: I'll go over another one on Saturday, and then I'll have another, like, review… blah blah blah.

John Rogers: So… Just remember something.

John Rogers: I think the exam is hard, okay? I am going into grading this thinking it's hard, okay?

John Rogers: And that's just my personal opinion.

John Rogers: So… Just… put this on a, like…

John Rogers: Write it on a piece of paper and stick it to your wall. When you open up that vinyl and you think that this is hard, oh my god, you can look at that note that I told you to write and say, I know it's hard, and I'm going into grading this thinking it's very hard, okay?

John Rogers: So I kinda know.

John Rogers: I know it's hard.

John Rogers: And I know that there's going to be sections where you're gonna get fumbled up.

John Rogers: I know you're gonna get fumbled up.

John Rogers: It's okay, just do the best you can.

John Rogers: when I do have a review, I definitely think that,

John Rogers: If you, for some reason, cannot make it, and you cannot access the recordings, you need to let me know as soon as possible.

John Rogers: Because there just are things that I think you might want to know.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: But I… I think it's a hard exam. I do think it's hard.

John Rogers: But it's okay. Be fine. Look, you can hate me all you want, you can send me hateful text messages, I hope you die, I hope you get fired, and blah blah, whatever. You can say whatever you want.

John Rogers: I know it's hard, okay? I know it's hard.

John Rogers: Right? So don't get scared, get happy, because usually when it's really hard, everybody falls on their face, and if that's good, that's good for you! The standard is much lower.

John Rogers: Much, much lower.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: That's it. Class is paroled. This could potentially be the last time that I'd see you in the live, until 2026.

John Rogers: So, remember, you can always call me, text me, email me if you guys have any questions, okay?

John Rogers: But I will keep you posted about reviews and stuff like that.

Yessenia Soria: Professor, any update on the practice essays?

John Rogers: I've been super busy, I'm really behind, and I promise.

Yessenia Soria: Okay.

John Rogers: I will get to it. I've been super behind. As I told one other student, just stick with me until I pull out my hair.

John Rogers: To just keep.

Yessenia Soria: Okay.

John Rogers: Keep texting me, keep texting.

John Rogers: She knows… I don't want to bother you.

John Rogers: There's someone else I told, and I didn't get a text from her today. I didn't get a text from her yesterday.

Yessenia Soria: I know, I want to give you a break, because I know you mentioned you were very…

John Rogers: The best way to get me to really do something

John Rogers: is, just bother me as much as possible, so I go, God, just leave me alone! Fine, I'll get it done.

Yessenia Soria: to get a restraining order on me.

John Rogers: That's the best way.

John Rogers: Best way.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, Professor, thank you so much.

John Rogers: So… I'll contact my counterpart, I'll clarify that.

dovenight: Sorry to bother you, I know you're so busy with your job and everything, I know you must tear your hair out, but we're trying to be respectful.

John Rogers: Thank you. Thank you for trying to be respectful.

John Rogers: Yeah, you could message me during dead week, you could do whatever you want.

John Rogers: I don't know when the deadline is for you to contact me. I do know for sure that once the exams go out, which I think is at, like, 6? 6 PM?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, 6.30, I believe.

John Rogers: God.

Yessenia Soria: 30.

John Rogers: Like, when heaven starts. Ha! .

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): The long first night, trust me.

John Rogers: you know, don't message me, don't text me, don't email me any questions you have. So if there's an issue, and you need clarification, email Patty.

John Rogers: She will call me.

John Rogers: Then I will tell her to email everyone this, or I will email her and say, forward it to the class, and she'll do that.

John Rogers: That way, so just keep an eye out on your email.

John Rogers: Just in case.

John Rogers: Like, maybe there's an error? I remember, two years ago.

John Rogers: a bunch of students emailed her saying, there's an error, there's an error, and I said, there is no error! Period. And she forwarded it to everyone. There is no error.

John Rogers: There was no error.

John Rogers: But anyways, yeah, so contact her, she'll contact me.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: But I'm worried about… A lot of you. I'm very worried about you guys.

Yessenia Soria: Oh my god, you're just stressing me more.

John Rogers: So… I'm not worried about everyone, I'm just… I'm worried about some of you, because I don't hear from a lot of you, so I get nervous that,

John Rogers: So… Anyways…

John Rogers: That's all I got. You guys are paroled, you can do whatever it is that you want to do with your life right now.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, thank you, Professor. I appreciate everything I've learned from you. Have a great holiday, Thanksgiving, see you next year.

Yessenia Soria: I'll try to make your reviews, but we have those mandatory ones for contracts and

Yessenia Soria: The other one with the dean.

John Rogers: Yeah, well, you tell the dean, say that I take more priority than he does.

Yessenia Soria: If you do it that day, I promise you, I will be in your class, and I'll just hear history.

John Rogers: You tell him that I said that he is beneath me, and I am above him. You tell him.

dovenight: Lord, that's your boy.

John Rogers: He'll laugh, he should laugh.

John Rogers: I hope he laughs.

John Rogers: Hobie laughed.

John Rogers: He will, but you can always ask him property questions, too, because he used to teach property.

maddykoshkaryan: I was about to say that, you asked us to ask a property question.

John Rogers: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, do that, do that.

maddykoshkaryan: He'll throw… he'll be, like, probably yelling at us.

John Rogers: He doesn't yell.

maddykoshkaryan: Oh, God.

John Rogers: He doesn't yell.

John Rogers: You will never get.

Isabella Salahshoor: too.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): He definitely does not seem like the yelling type, that's true.

John Rogers: It's not… you have never heard him yell.

John Rogers: Never heard him yell, ever before. Always keeps his cool, and is very careful about what he says.

dovenight: You show a different side when you're working with you guys, the teachers.

John Rogers: Excuse me?

dovenight: Dean show a different side when he… because he's so calm, he showed a different side with you guys.

John Rogers: I added to him, how he teaches is exactly his personality outside of teaching, too.

John Rogers: Exactly.

John Rogers: There's no difference.

John Rogers: So he's, he's the real deal.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): That's good, that's good to know. I'm happy to hear that.

Agnes Gholoonian: Thank you so much, Professor, it was a fun semester.

John Rogers: Oh, my… Property is fun? I don't know about that. I don't know about that.

Agnes Gholoonian: Property is horrible, we're not putting… you're a great professor, so really enjoyed your class, so…

John Rogers: Aggies, you can go on if you want.

Agnes Gholoonian: I'll see you on Saturday, and then next week.

John Rogers: Alright.

Agnes Gholoonian: Thanks, take care. Bye.

Yessenia Soria: Have a good one, everybody.

John Rogers: I'll stick around if anyone has questions.

maddykoshkaryan: Bye, Professor, thank you for everything.

John Rogers: Thank you, Professor. Yeah. I'm scared.

Mireya Gonzalez: Thank you!

dovenight: I'm ready.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Thank you so much for the class, thank you.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, I don't think you have anything to worry about. You really… you went above and beyond to prepare us really well for this final.

John Rogers: There's one thing that I have to prepare you for that I haven't discussed yet.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Ball.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): But I look forward to that.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I look forward to the review class, then.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): But you did great work. I really, can't thank you enough. It's, very insightful, and I've taken a lot of really amazing notes, so,

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): We remain friends, and I appreciate that.

John Rogers: Yeah, alright, alright.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Thank you, Professor, it's been an honor. I'll see you on Saturday.

John Rogers: Alright.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Good night.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: The review that you're gonna do, either the 21st, 22nd, or 23rd, that's just one of… you just do one.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: And then the other ones are for your evidence class.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: As far as the D.

John Rogers: I… I really don't want to do the 22nd.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Yeah, 22nd is also, again, Frickbury's review, 11 to 2, so…

John Rogers: Who cares about that?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Why, because it's a Saturday, or is that a Saturday?

John Rogers: You go, just tell them I told you not to care about it, because my clown.

John Rogers: more important.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: At this point, with all the things you said tonight, for sure.

John Rogers: He's writing your final, though, for contracts, right?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Yeah, but contracts, you know you're gonna get one UCC, one…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You already know what's going on over there.

John Rogers: Huh?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: And he throws in multiple choice.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You have 36 hours to figure it out.

John Rogers: Oh, no, only 36 hours?

John Rogers: Oh no!

John Rogers: I have dropped… I've read this on your final, by the way. I have dropped hints at your final, okay?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: And he dropped a couple tonight, I noticed.

John Rogers: I think I did.

John Rogers: I think I did.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: About that.

John Rogers: I have no idea. I'm not gonna confirm or deny anything.

John Rogers: zero. But there is something that you're gonna have to know that I'm not… I'm gonna make it obvious, but I'm just not gonna say that you…

John Rogers: But there's… there'll be something you'll need to know.

John Rogers: that I didn't really cover.

John Rogers: Yeah, I didn't really cover it.

John Rogers: You're okay.

Amir Akbari: Lucky.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I heard one of the…

Amir Akbari: UV, right? And…

John Rogers: What?

Amir Akbari: And you will cover that, and…

John Rogers: Oh, yes, for sure. I can't, I can't… you can't be tested on something that I didn't really cover. It's not fair.

Leanna Badar: But it's in your outline, right?

John Rogers: no.

Leanna Badar: Okay.

John Rogers: It's in… the book…

John Rogers: And I did point it out.

John Rogers: Don't worry.

John Rogers: would be fine.

John Rogers: But just… I'll tell the class that it's… it… I just think it's hard to kind of follow

John Rogers: Maybe you'll look at it and say it's not bad. It's not as bad as, you know, I made it out to be, because maybe sometimes I have a tendency to…

John Rogers: You know, say the sky is falling.

John Rogers: I just think it would be challenging.

John Rogers: And I just… Just do the best you can.

John Rogers: It's fine. I'm not expecting everyone to really just knock it out of the park, to be honest.

John Rogers: Okay? I have a feeling things aren't gonna flow nicely either, which is fine.

John Rogers: I got you.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I think one of the questions

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Because I think the mentor talked to Dolomagian, Because he was trying to…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: or something, and said, I have Rogers students. I think she said something about one of the questions being really gonna be really tough for us.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Yeah. Is that…

John Rogers: I think two of them are.

John Rogers: 1 and 3 are tough.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: The language they use was… two of them are doable. One of them is really hard.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I think that was the language they used.

John Rogers: On Saturday? I mean, on Saturday, I might just kind of have a review, won't even go over an essay, so maybe I can go over some material.

John Rogers: But… Yeah, it's gonna be tough. I just think so.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: So, like, a D paper will be, like, a B- paper, is that what we're looking at?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: We'll see. I kind of have to see where the class does.

John Rogers: So, I don't think it's proper.

John Rogers: just don't tell my other colleagues about it, but to just do one read-through of all the exams, issue a letter grade, and that's it. I think that you have to read them all of these twice, because you have to understand where everyone's at.

John Rogers: So, I usually do one read-through to figure out

John Rogers: where is everybody at? Like, did everyone see this, or no? What did they say for this, and this, and this, and this, and this? And the second read-through is when I'll issue, like, a grade. But I also have someone helping me as well.

John Rogers: So…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Do you mark down for non-issues?

John Rogers: I told you! I told you! You can write whatever you want, you can't get marked down for things you don't need.

John Rogers: So, you can write about anything you want.

John Rogers: I told my class last night in evidence, I said, you can… you can talk about your trip to Portugal, what you ate there. I don't care, you're not gonna get marked down. It's just… you're not gonna earn points.

John Rogers: Even if you write about how great you were this semester? Yeah!

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Sneak it. They sneak it.

John Rogers: Yeah, throw that in there. That's… it's, like, 1200 IQ-type answer.

John Rogers: Don't write that, okay? Do not write that.

John Rogers: You guys, you guys are all scared, you're all sticking around.

Yessenia Soria: Yes, we don't want to miss anything.

John Rogers: I think you're probably gonna have a more difficult time in this class than you've been on contracts. I just think so.

John Rogers: And who's writing your finals? Is it Jay Frick… is it the dean? Frickber?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: And he graves it, I think.

John Rogers: They're all the same.

John Rogers: Crossing.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: It's always one UCC one.

John Rogers: Awesome.

John Rogers: It's all the same. They're all the same.

John Rogers: They're all the same.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, well, once again, Professor, thank you so much. You were great. You taught me a lot.

Yessenia Soria: And I appreciate all the help you've been giving me.

John Rogers: You bet, you bet.

Yessenia Soria: Good night.

John Rogers: Lisa, you can call me.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, good night, everybody. Have a good weekend. Stay safe.

John Rogers: Is that it, guys, or am I paroled?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You got any more secrets, hints?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Extra information, exclusive information.

John Rogers: I don't have any more.

John Rogers: gifts.

Fatima Razavi: Are there any specific essays you really want us to focus on?

John Rogers: Someone asked me about acronyms. Yeah, absolutely.

John Rogers: But I would, just be very careful with acronyms, but yes, you can use acronyms, absolutely. Just don't say, like, FSA, you have to say fee simple absolute, open parentheses, FSA, close parentheses. Don't just put FSA.

John Rogers: Yeah, you can use acronyms.

Fatima Razavi: Are there any essays?

Fatima Razavi: Out of the many essays you sent us, are there specific ones that really stand out for you?

John Rogers: I… you've asked me this, like, 5 times. I think you almost asked me 5 times tonight.

Fatima Razavi: I know, but I feel like I've heard different answers, so maybe I…

John Rogers: You're not really gonna find something very specific.

John Rogers: Okay.

Fatima Razavi: Are there, like, 5… what's your top 5?

John Rogers: I think… 3 and 4?

John Rogers: Are kinda similar to it, in my opinion.

John Rogers: 3 and 4.

John Rogers: And those are Michelle Tabankan questions. She used to teach this class for, like, 30 years.

John Rogers: Okay, so it's kind of like that.

John Rogers: But I think it's more detailed, like, more… Detailed. More, issues.

Fatima Razavi: Are there any cases in the book that we should focus on? I feel like you talk about Longfellow quite often.

John Rogers: I don't know. I'll let you know on Saturday, though.

Fatima Razavi: Okay.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Are you gonna send out your time for Saturday, like, Friday night?

John Rogers: Yeah.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Or, like, Saturday morning when we wake up, but… Holy shit, it's 10 o'clock.

John Rogers: Time you waking up. Time you waking up. Time you wake it up, because I will be up tomorrow at, like, 4.45 in the morning. So what time you waking up?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: That's because you're making the big bucks.

John Rogers: wake up early. But yeah.

John Rogers: You can have your camera off, whatever, you can literally be in bed, sleeping as it's going on, if you want.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I just want to know when to log on.

John Rogers: It'll probably be a 10.30.

John Rogers: Probably 10.30, like, 12.30. So do you want to do property first, or do you want me to do evidence first?

Fatima Razavi: Property first.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Nope.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Don't you have more to talk about for property, because you have to teach something?

John Rogers: I don't know… I… I seem to think that you said that you want to always do property last.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Yeah.

John Rogers: Well, it allows…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: has planned Saturday.

John Rogers: Plans on Saturday, okay.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: She gotta get done in the morning.

John Rogers: Yeah, I might not go over an essay on Saturday, I might just kind of do… problems.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Leanna Badar: Actually, I have a quick question about, question 3. So, when we were talking about, like, the tacking, if we find that bill

Leanna Badar: Like, the tacking doesn't work, then we would talk about abandonment.

Leanna Badar: Like, because of the gardening supplies, like, if he's leaving, then do we talk about abandonment?

John Rogers: I mean, it's just part of, kind of, the discussion, it's not an independent issue.

Leanna Badar: Yeah, it's just, like, analysis in there.

John Rogers: Yeah, it just kind of looks like Adam is abandoning his effort.

Leanna Badar: Okay.

John Rogers: And Bill just incidentally… Or coincidentally.

John Rogers: came about as Adam was leaving.

John Rogers: So there was no really formal transaction between the two.

Leanna Badar: Right, so it wouldn't necessarily need, like, its own…

Leanna Badar: abandonment subsection. It's just, like, a no. Okay.

Leanna Badar: Thank you.

Fatima Razavi: Can we go over the marriage thing again, please?

John Rogers: And Leanna, I think I…

John Rogers: I think you actually do talk a little bit more than I play in class.

Leanna Badar: Yeah.

John Rogers: But not a lot, but…

Leanna Badar: I don't know.

John Rogers: Yeah, you do. I mean, there's definitely others in class. I would love to hear their voice, but yeah, I don't…

John Rogers: You do talk, but not a lot, but you do.

John Rogers: You wanna go over the restraint on marriage?

John Rogers: What about it?

Fatima Razavi: So…

Fatima Razavi: If they are doing it for the benefit of the person, then it's not a restraint on marriage.

Fatima Razavi: Like, how… what is the difference? Can you kind of explain that again, please?

John Rogers: Explain what?

Fatima Razavi: Just, if you're reading something, it says that the land is with them just as long as they don't get married.

Fatima Razavi: I'm just looking at question 4, sorry, I know I'm just jumping around, but I know time is kind of limited. But question number 4, second pair of graphs, says, last year Roger became engaged to Jane, and I feel like we're talking a lot about people getting married, not getting married…

Fatima Razavi: And I just want to see how everything kind of fits in.

John Rogers: Oh, wait, it said engaged, it didn't say they got married?

John Rogers: So there's no breach.

Fatima Razavi: Okay.

John Rogers: Did I misread that?

Fatima Razavi: I'm talking about question 4.

John Rogers: Yes, we… oh, did we do question 3?

John Rogers: Or no.

Amir Akbari: No, it's married.

Amir Akbari: It's married. In question 3, it's married.

Fatima Razavi: Oh yeah, question 4 is engaged.

John Rogers: You're talking about the Mad Acre one?

John Rogers: Okay, what about it?

Fatima Razavi: I was just asking in general, just if we could just go over the restraint on marriage. So, if there's a restraint on marriage.

Fatima Razavi: It's void.

John Rogers: Nope.

John Rogers: Was it void?

John Rogers: Question 3?

Fatima Razavi: No, because they were doing it for the best interests of the person.

John Rogers: But there's also part… a second part of that discussion, too. What was that?

John Rogers: January.

John Rogers: I read it from the book.

Fatima Razavi: And I… what is it, page 318 or something?

John Rogers: It's in my notes, too.

Fatima Razavi: Obviously, I remember the page, so I was gonna look over it.

Fatima Razavi: I listen.

Fatima Razavi: Okay.

John Rogers: If it's durational language, It's more of an indication of… Providing until marriage.

John Rogers: But if it's a condition subsequent, like restrictional, like but if, or uncondition at.

John Rogers: It's more penalizing marriage, punishing for marriage.

John Rogers: I've never tested on that in my life.

John Rogers: Nor that I care about having it be tested ever.

Fatima Razavi: The hint has been received.

John Rogers: So am I done for the night? You guys have questions?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Do you have court tomorrow?

John Rogers: No, I don't have court tomorrow.

John Rogers: Very happy.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Criminals are… criminals are relaxing tomorrow. They don't need you tomorrow.

John Rogers: I try just not to have court appearances on Fridays. I don't care about Mondays, give me a packed Monday. I love Mondays. Monday's my favorite day of the week. I just don't like going to court on Fridays.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Do you have any interesting cases right now?

John Rogers: I don't know what is interesting.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: a gruesome A lot of money involved group.

John Rogers: I don't think anything's falling like that right now. I don't think. Nothing comes to mind.

John Rogers: Nothing is coming to… I don't think I have anything really that cool right now.

John Rogers: Something cool right now that I think of.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, how many criminal cases do you have at a time?

John Rogers: I don't know right now.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Like, what's manageable?

John Rogers: Let's see if I can access it. I don't know, I mean, let me…

John Rogers: I wanna… let me count if I can right now, let's see how many open cases I have.

John Rogers: Some are really big.

John Rogers: Is it just you, or you have, like, a paralegal, or, like, a full office?

John Rogers: I have an assistant. The problem is, I have… I might just hire another attorney in January, but the problem is, is that…

John Rogers: I've got trust issues.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I can see that you'd be very particular of how you want things.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Or how do you want the person to think.

John Rogers: 1, 2…

John Rogers: I have 31 open cases right now.

John Rogers: which… If it was, like, DUIs, it'd be super simple, but some of these are really big.

John Rogers: Like, one's a,

John Rogers: A five-count rape case, another one's another rape case, another one is a third striker that put two police officers in the hospital.

John Rogers: One's a mortgage fraud case, where it's, like.

John Rogers: 1.5 million pages of discovery. It's just, like, some of these are big.

John Rogers: So yeah, I got my hands full right now. I got 31 right now.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I was expecting, like, pennies.

Gevorg Kulikyan: No. More than enough.

John Rogers: Full plate right now.

John Rogers: full plate right now, and that's why I'm like.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Are you doing?

John Rogers: I'm super busy.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Are you referral only, or you kind of advertise also, or it's just like…

John Rogers: I don't…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I don't know.

John Rogers: I don't spend any money on advertising.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Do you have any trials coming up?

John Rogers: I have a ton coming up next year.

Gevorg Kulikyan: A lot.

John Rogers: a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot. And I don't…

John Rogers: So you may have to expect a lot of class cancellations.

Gevorg Kulikyan: My wife said, can we come?

John Rogers: Yeah, it's open to the public.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I used to have students go to my trials all the time.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah. Any in the Van Nuys courthouse?

John Rogers: My last one was there. Maybe that one might not be for a long time, though.

John Rogers: That won't be for a long time.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I'm in Sun Valley, so I'm willing to go to downtown, but…

John Rogers: Downtown, yeah.

John Rogers: Probably might have some downtown.

John Rogers: Airport.

John Rogers: Everywhere.

John Rogers: Riverside.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I think it was, like, A week and a half.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Was it 2 weeks ago? There was a,

Gevorg Kulikyan: UWLA, at the LAX campus, they had a trial thing, where it was a bunch of trial attorneys coming to speak.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I went to that, that was very insightful.

John Rogers: Oh, yeah, so you saw, like, Evan Davis, Earl Cook…

John Rogers: Austin Dove, right?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yes, yes.

John Rogers: I saw one of the… I saw Evan Davis, the woman, she's Ultimate Public, I saw her today. I was like, oh, I missed it!

John Rogers: So…

Gevorg Kulikyan: Rosa… the… I think she was, like, the head or the assistant head of the public defender's office?

John Rogers: Justine?

Gevorg Kulikyan: I think so, yeah.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I didn't hear back from them, so I was gonna pull her to the side, and then she left.

John Rogers: Yeah, I know exactly what you're talking about.

John Rogers: I think she works down the street at the airport court.

John Rogers: What's her name? Forget her name. But yeah, she's definitely a shock caller in the Public Defender's Office.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, she said reach out to me, but…

Gevorg Kulikyan: I didn't get a chance to talk to her, but…

Gevorg Kulikyan: PD's office didn't get back to me.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I don't think they liked my answer.

Sennett Devermont: Her name was Jacqueline Baskerville.

John Rogers: Yes.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Right.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yes.

John Rogers: So you had an in… oh, you had an interview with them!

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: You gotta talk to me before you go into an interview with the Public Defender's Office?

Gevorg Kulikyan: I didn't think it was that deep, to be honest, I don't know why.

John Rogers: They want to know how far will you push yourself for your client.

John Rogers: Because you're gonna be encountering people that don't like you, that think you're a bad lawyer.

John Rogers: That spit on you.

John Rogers: And… Can you still protect their rights?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, I… I feel like my answer…

Gevorg Kulikyan: portrayed that, but I guess not. Maybe they just didn't like me.

John Rogers: You'd have to reapply again, then?

John Rogers: Did you apply for the spring?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: Then you have to apply for summer.

John Rogers: Reapply all over again.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Alright.

Gevorg Kulikyan: They also asked, there was a question, it was like, if you don't get…

Gevorg Kulikyan: Like, if you don't work at the PD's office, where will you work?

Gevorg Kulikyan: I feel like…

Gevorg Kulikyan: they were assuming one would answer the DA's office, but I said private practice for criminal defense. I thought that was a good answer.

John Rogers: I would have said APD.

John Rogers: alternate public defender, because there's two public defender's offices in LA County. There's public defender and alternate public defender.

Gevorg Kulikyan: But alternate, isn't that… aren't those, like, private practice attorneys?

John Rogers: No, that's bar panel.

John Rogers: So, here's what happens.

John Rogers: If someone walks into court, a defendant, and the public defender's office has a conflict that can't represent him or her.

John Rogers: It then goes to Alternate Public Defender's Office.

John Rogers: There's two separate offices. There's PD, APD. And then if APD has a conflict, then it goes to bar panel.

John Rogers: Which is private attorneys that also do court-appointed work on the side.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, Mancini told me about that in the criminal practice class.

Gevorg Kulikyan: was, I thought that was the alternate. So the third party is the bar panel.

John Rogers: Yes. It's called Idco, I-D-C-O.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Indian Defense…

John Rogers: Office, something like that.

Gevorg Kulikyan: But the pay isn't that great, huh?

John Rogers: It's not like you would… get in private. But a lot of people are on it.

John Rogers: Lots of people are on it.

John Rogers: Like, I'm on it.

John Rogers: But you don't have to do it full-time.

John Rogers: But a lot of people are on it.

John Rogers: But you don't have to take cases if you don't want to.

Gevorg Kulikyan: But that would just be conspiracy cases, no?

Gevorg Kulikyan: For there to be, like, a… conflict?

Gevorg Kulikyan: What other type of…

John Rogers: cases.

John Rogers: Sure.

John Rogers: Or…

John Rogers: If someone is charged with a crime, and the Public Defender's Office takes it, and all of a sudden the Public Defender's Office represented the victim, who is the victim of now this defendant, then they have to declare conflict.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: So, it's… happens all the time.

Gevorg Kulikyan: All the time.

John Rogers: All the public defender's Office declares conflicts all the time.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So there's… is that, like, a good referral source?

John Rogers: Oh, refer… the Public Defender's Office?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah, like, we're… Maybe not referral source, but yeah, like a referral source.

Gevorg Kulikyan: like, the… being on the bar panel, like, that situation that you said, I, P, C, or…

John Rogers: IDCO.

Gevorg Kulikyan: IDCL.

John Rogers: it, I mean, it's… it's court-appointed work, so you don't get, like, referral court-appointed.

Gevorg Kulikyan: That you'd only get…

John Rogers: I mean, the public defender's office would be a good referral source if someone, like, one of their family members or friend reaches out to them, like, hey, I got in trouble, do you know a good lawyer? Then they could refer it out.

John Rogers: They can't take the case.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Nice.

John Rogers: But yeah, you can also apply to the APD's office for clerking.

John Rogers: Alternate Public Defender's office. Totally separate office.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Oh, it's separate. Separate website, separate everything.

John Rogers: Totally separate.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: Public Defender's Office is on the 19th floor downtown.

John Rogers: Alternate Public Defender's Office is on the 18th floor.

John Rogers: So, totally separate office, so you can apply to them, and if you get an interview, you don't go into that interview without talking to me first.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I will let you know for sure.

John Rogers: Probably know the people interviewing you.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Here we go.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Can I apply after this class?

John Rogers: Alternate public defender.

John Rogers: And I recommend everyone.

John Rogers: join PD, APD, DA's office, doesn't matter. I always recommend students try to go for it, even as, like, their first job. A lot of them… a lot of the students, including you all, are stupid and won't do it. And, they always say, no, I want to do PI, I want to do that.

John Rogers: Here's the thing I tell everyone.

John Rogers: If you're a public defender for 3 years, 4 years, 5 years.

John Rogers: You're a public defender of 5 years.

John Rogers: I don't care what PI office you go into, you will DESTROY all in the trial.

John Rogers: They are children. They are beneath you.

John Rogers: I don't care how… who the PI attorney is, you'll have more experience in evidence, in contested hearings, jury trials.

John Rogers: Way more than them.

John Rogers: So they would want you.

John Rogers: You'd have more trial experience than the person interviewing you.

John Rogers: You're in court every day.

John Rogers: And here's the thing, when…

John Rogers: in civil, like, my civil attorney friends, they always try to claim trial. They're gonna go to trial till, like.

John Rogers: To, like, kind of…

John Rogers: come across as being like, we're gonna go to trial, so you better settle with us. But if you're a public defender, even a DA, for 4 years.

John Rogers: You would just look back at them and say, let's go today.

John Rogers: I'm ready now.

John Rogers: So, it's a really good job to start off your career with. It's not bad. You can go into any area. And I always recommend Public Defender.

John Rogers: because… If you become a DA, you don't really learn how to cross-examine as…

John Rogers: a DA. You're always putting on the witness.

John Rogers: But as a public defender or defense attorney, you're… Constantly.

John Rogers: cross-examining witnesses. And that is the art of lawyering.

John Rogers: Is the defense of cross-examining witnesses.

John Rogers: That is the art. It's a complete art of cross-examination.

John Rogers: And the beauty of it, as a public defender, you are cross-examining the hardest people to cross-examine in the world. Police officers, who are trained to testify.

John Rogers: So you polish yourself up at cross-examining police officers, you can go to any civil law firm, I'm sure they totally would want you.

John Rogers: That makes sense? I don't mean to bash PI law firms, I'm just trying to say, I mean, you could really build the foundation.

John Rogers: Because a lot of students say, I want to do PI,

John Rogers: But here's the thing, if you just graduate, you just become a lawyer, and you start your own PI gig, why would someone give you business?

John Rogers: Why?

John Rogers: There's so many other PI attorneys out there, and what…

John Rogers: What distinguishes yourself from everyone else?

John Rogers: Other than just, oh, my… I'm getting referrals from my friends.

John Rogers: So… Sell me. How… why would I give you a client?

John Rogers: That's… So, if you… Do some type of government service.

John Rogers: It just really jumpstarts your career, in my opinion.

John Rogers: I don't mean to badmouth this, but I'm just trying to tell you it's a good start of your career.

John Rogers: David Glassman. You will all take David Glassman for appellate advocacy. He's a Deputy Attorney General. He's one of the most… he's one of the most prominent appellate attorneys in all of California.

John Rogers: If he likes you, and you do well in his class, I'm sure that he would sign your application to become a Deputy Attorney General of California, which would be phenomenal.

John Rogers: No one does.

John Rogers: No one does!

John Rogers: So, yes, the students are idiots, they don't take advantage of all that.

John Rogers: That's my spiel.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Do you think the experience as a clerk throughout law school would be enough Trial experience?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Or… Wouldn't, right?

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: Not at all.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So you recommend actually working as a PD?

John Rogers: I would always recommend working as a public defender. You're not gonna make a lot of money. You're gonna have long hours.

John Rogers: You're not gonna make the money as you would in private, but you have a lot of experience. You'll learn a lot of things.

John Rogers: When you think fast, good on your feet.

John Rogers: You get handed off a case that says, hey, you gotta do this trial in…

John Rogers: 40 minutes. You're like, what?

John Rogers: And you get good.

John Rogers: Ask… there's a student, Karen. Karen. You know who I'm talking about?

John Rogers: I'm here.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Certified, certified, certified… something.

John Rogers: I did my evidence class, and I see him in court downtown doing bail hearings.

John Rogers: So he's arguing, he's doing all this in a downtown court!

John Rogers: Yeah, talk to him about it. He would be a good resource for you to try to get your foot in there.

John Rogers: Do you know him?

Fatima Razavi: He's a mentor for contracts.

John Rogers: Well, if you're interested, reach out to him. Tell him I told you to reach out to him.

Gevorg Kulikyan: I don't personally know, I… I think I might have had a class with him, but I'm not sure.

John Rogers: reach out to him, tell him I told you to reach out to him about it.

John Rogers: There you go. Done.

Fatima Razavi: I can introduce you guys.

Fatima Razavi: I'll send an email. Can you shoot me your email? I'll do an introduction.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: Anyways, that's my spiel about government service.

John Rogers: Anything else, guys?

Amir Akbari: Thank you so much for your great class and advice.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Supervisor.

John Rogers: Okay, yeah, I think I gotta call it now.

Sennett Devermont: Thank you, have a good one.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You were great, thank you so much.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Thank you so much. We'll see you Saturday. Thanks.

Fatima Razavi: Amazing class, thank you.
