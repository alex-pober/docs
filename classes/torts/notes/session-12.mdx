# I. Joint & Several Liability and Comparative Fault (Review)

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* **Joint and Several Liability:** When multiple defendants act in **concert** (concert of action), the Plaintiff can recover the **full amount** of damages from *any* of the joint tortfeasors, regardless of their individual percentage of fault.
    * **Essence:** The Plaintiff can collect the full amount from either defendant.
* **Absence of Concert (Comparative Fault):** If defendants are **not** acting in concert, Joint and Several Liability does not apply. Instead, damages are **apportioned** based on **Comparative Fault**.
    * The jury determines the percentage of fault for each defendant.
    * A defendant is only liable for the damages corresponding to their specific percentage of fault.

### 2. Hypotheticals & Examples
* **The Drag Racing Hypo (Concert of Action):**
    * *Scenario:* Two drivers drag race. One hits Plaintiff (P), causing $100k damages. The other driver did not hit P.
    * *Outcome:* Because they acted in **concert** (common goal/unison of action), they are Jointly and Severally liable. P can recover the full $100k from the driver who did *not* hit him.
* **The Bankruptcy Hypo (No Concert):**
    * *Scenario:* D1 (5% fault), D2 (20% fault), and D3 (75% fault) cause $100k in damages but are *not* acting in concert. D2 and D3 are bankrupt (not amenable to lawsuit).
    * *Outcome:* P can only recover $5,000 from D1. D1 is not liable for the shares of D2 and D3 because there is no Joint and Several liability.
    * *Contrast:* If they *were* acting in concert, P could recover the full $100k from D1 (the 5% fault defendant).

### 3. Key Cases
* **Case Name:** *Coney*
    * **Facts:** Plaintiff killed by a hydraulic platform. Sued manufacturer (defect) and employer (failure to train).
    * **Holding:** The manufacturer and employer were **not** acting in concert (no joint plan). Therefore, distinct acts of negligence contributed to the injury, distinguishing it from true "concert of action" cases.

# II. Causation (Clarification)

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
To prove **Causation in Fact** (a prima facie element), the test changes based on the number and type of defendants:
* **Single Defendant:** Use the **"But-For" Test**. (But for D's conduct, P would not have been injured) .
* **Concurrent Causes:** Two or more defendants' negligence combine to cause injury, where neither act alone was sufficient.
    * **Test:** Use the **"But-For" Test**. (e.g., But for the buggy having no lights, the accident would not have happened).
* **Joint Causes:** Two or more causes come together, and *either* would have been sufficient to cause the injury.
    * **Test:** Use the **Substantial Factor Test**. The "But-For" test fails here.
* **Alternative Causes:** Two defendants act negligently, but P cannot prove which one caused the injury (e.g., *Summers v. Tice*).
    * **Test:** The court **shifts the burden of proof** to the defendants to absolve themselves. If they cannot, they are liable.

# III. Contribution

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* **Definition:** Contribution is a device whereby responsibility for payment is apportioned among those at fault.
* **Rule:** Any **joint tortfeasor** who pays **more than his share** of Plaintiff's damages may seek **contribution** (partial reimbursement) from other tortfeasors [cite: 442-446].
* **Prerequisite:** This generally applies when Joint and Several Liability exists. If liability is already apportioned by percentage (comparative fault without J&S), contribution is unnecessary because a defendant never pays more than their specific share.
* **Third-Party Claims:** A defendant's right to contribution is not barred by the Plaintiff's choice of defendants. A defendant can file a third-party complaint (cross-complaint) against an unnamed tortfeasor to seek contribution.

### 2. Key Cases
* **Case Name:** *Knell*
    * **Facts:** Collision between a car (driven by Nell) and a Taxicab. Passenger sued the Taxi. Taxi filed a third-party complaint against Nell.
    * **Holding:** A right to contribution exists against a joint tortfeasor even if the Plaintiff chose not to sue that specific tortfeasor.
* **Case Name:** *Yellow Cab*
    * **Facts:** Taxi collided with a car driven by Mrs. Dreslin's husband. Mrs. Dreslin sued Taxi. Taxi sought contribution from the husband. Husband claimed "intra-family immunity."
    * **Holding:** Contribution allowed. Immunity (which is now largely obsolete) did not bar the third-party claim for contribution based on concurrent negligence.
* **Case Name:** *Slocum*
    * **Facts:** Driver backed over a child and was sued. Driver sought contribution/indemnity from Ford (manufacturer). Ford settled with Plaintiff.
    * **Holding:** Under the specific state statute (MA), a defendant who **settles** with the Plaintiff is exempt from contribution claims by non-settling defendants.

# IV. Indemnity

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* **Definition:** Indemnity involves shifting the **entire loss** from one tortfeasor to another (in contrast to contribution, which is partial reimbursement).
* **Trigger:** Indemnity is typically a function of **Contract** or **Vicarious Liability**.
    * *Example:* A lease agreement often creates an indemnity obligation where the tenant must indemnify the landlord for lawsuits.
    * *Example:* An employer (like UPS) indemnifying an employee driver for accidents occurring within the scope of employment.

# V. Satisfaction

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* **Rule:** A Plaintiff may file as many lawsuits against potential defendants as they choose and take them to judgment. However, the Plaintiff may collect only **one full satisfaction** [cite: 868-873].
* **Effect:** Once a judgment is fully satisfied (paid) by one defendant, the Plaintiff cannot collect from other defendants to avoid unjust enrichment/double recovery.
* **Procedure:** A debtor should obtain a notarized **Satisfaction of Judgment** upon payment.

### 2. Key Cases
* **Case Name:** *Bundt*
    * **Facts:** Passengers injured in a collision sued drivers and the State (highway repair). They were awarded damages against the State.
    * **Holding:** Plaintiff may sue multiple parties but is limited to one full satisfaction of the judgment.

# VI. Release

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* **Definition:** A release is a **surrender** of the Plaintiff's cause of action against the party to whom the release is given [cite: 919-920].
* **Effect:** It legally extinguishes the cause of action (tort, contract, etc.) against that specific party.

### 2. Nuance & Policy
* **Unknown Claims (California Civil Code § 1542):** In practice, releases often include specific language to waive protections regarding **unknown or undiscovered** claims. Without this waiver, a general release might not cover injuries discovered after the fact.

# VII. Apportionment & Aggravation of Injuries

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* **Aggravation Rule:** If a Plaintiff has a pre-existing injury and is involved in a second accident, the new defendant is liable **only for the aggravation** (exasperation) of the injury, not the original injury [cite: 1091-1093].
* **Burden of Proof:** The burden remains on the Plaintiff to establish which injuries were caused by the specific accident in question.

### 2. Key Cases
* **Case Name:** *Bruckman*
    * **Facts:** Plaintiff injured in 1964. Injured again in 1965, aggravating the first injury.
    * **Holding:** The defendant in the second accident is responsible only for the injuries they caused (the aggravation), not the entirety of the damages.

---

# VIII. Duty (Negligence Prima Facie Element)

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* **Definition:** The existence of a duty to conform to a **specific standard of conduct** to protect the Plaintiff against an **unreasonable risk of harm**.
* **Establishment of Duty:** There are three primary ways to establish a Duty of Care:
    1.  **Privity of Contract:** A contractual relationship creates a duty (e.g., Attorney-Client).
    2.  **Statute (Negligence Per Se):** Violation of an applicable criminal statute.
        * *Effect:* Proves existence of duty AND breach.
        * *Requirements:* Plaintiff must be in the **protected class**, and the injury must be the **particular harm** the statute intended to avoid.
    3.  **Risk Creation (Misfeasance):** Engaging in an activity that increases the risk of physical harm toward **foreseeable plaintiffs**.
* **Duty to Rescue:** generally, there is **no duty to rescue**, unless:
    * There is a special relationship.
    * The defendant has the ability to control the means of help (e.g., department store controlling an escalator) [cite: 1408-1411].
* **Zone of Danger:** The area of increased risk of physical harm. A duty is owed to plaintiffs within this zone.

### 2. Key Cases
* **Case Name:** *Winterbottom v. Wright* (1842)
    * **Facts:** Mail coach driver injured when the coach broke down due to negligent repair by the defendant. Defendant had a contract with the Postmaster General, not the driver.
    * **Holding (Common Law - Historical):** The driver could not sue the repair shop because there was **no privity of contract**. At common law, privity was the *only* way to establish duty.
* **Case Name:** *MacPherson v. Buick* (1916)
    * **Facts:** Plaintiff bought a Buick from a dealer. A wooden wheel crumbled, causing injury. Plaintiff sued the manufacturer (Buick).
    * **Holding:** Cardozo rejected the strict privity requirement. Established that placing a dangerous/defective product into the stream of commerce creates a **duty of care** to the ultimate purchaser (foreseeable plaintiff) because it creates a risk of harm.
    * **Significance:** This created the "Risk Creation/Activity" pathway to finding Duty, moving beyond strict privity.
