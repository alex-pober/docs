title: "Session 05 - Present Possessory Interests & Defeasible Estates"
description: "Organized outline notes on present possessory interests, defeasible estates, restraints on alienation, and doctrine of waste"
---
## I. Overview of Present vs. Future Interests

### A. Basic Framework
- **O** = Owner/Grantor (presumed fee simple absolute holder)
- **A** = Present possessory interest holder (who has it NOW)
- **B, C, D, etc.** = Future interest holders

### B. Key Concept
- Present possessory interests focus on who has the property **right now**
- Future interests concern who gets it later (covered in subsequent sessions)

## II. Fee Simple Estates

### A. Fee Simple Absolute (FSA)

#### 1. Common Law Conveyance
- **Formula**: "O to A and his/her heirs"
- **MUST** contain the word "heirs" under common law
- Without "heirs" = problem under common law

#### 2. Modern Law Conveyance
- **Formula**: "O to A" (that's it!)
- **Presumption**: O transfers everything
- No need for additional language ("heirs" not required)
- Maximum ownership interest possible
- A can freely assign, sell, or do whatever A wants

### B. Fee Tail
- **Common Law Only** - does NOT exist modernly
- **Formula**: "O to A and the heirs of her body"
- **Limits interest** to lineal descendants of grantee (DNA/blood)
- Only ~3 states still follow it
- **Modern Treatment**: Creates a fee simple absolute instead

### C. Defeasible Fees

Three types of defeasible fees - all can potentially last forever and ever until breach:

#### 1. Fee Simple Determinable (FSD)

**Characteristics**:
- Uses **words of duration**: "so long as," "while," "until," "during"
- **Automatic forfeiture** upon breach
- O doesn't have to do anything - property automatically reverts

**Formula**: "O to A so long as Blackacre is used for residential purposes only"

**Breakdown**:
- O: Retains **possibility of reverter** (future interest, by operation of law)
- A: Has **fee simple determinable**
- **If breach occurs**: Property automatically forfeits from A and goes back to O (or O's heirs)
- **If no breach**: Goes to A's heirs, then their heirs, forever (all subject to same restriction)

**Key Rule**: Anytime a fee simple determinable is conveyed, O will ALWAYS, by operation of law, hold a **possibility of reverter**

#### 2. Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent (FSSCS)

**Characteristics**:
- Uses **restrictional/contractual language**: "on condition that," "provided that," "but if"
- **NO automatic forfeiture**
- **Discretionary** - O (or O's heirs) may elect to re-enter and take back

**Formula**: "O to A on condition that Blackacre is used for residential purposes, otherwise O reserves the right to re-enter and retake Blackacre"

**Breakdown**:
- O: Retains **right of entry** (also called "power of termination")
- A: Has **fee simple subject to condition subsequent**
- **If breach occurs**: O has the right to re-enter (but must exercise it)
- **Right of entry must be expressly reserved** in the conveyance

**Adverse Possession Timing**:
- Clock does NOT start ticking until O exercises right of re-entry
- Continuous use, even if in breach, is presumed valid until O acts
- Once O tries to re-enter and divest A, adverse possession clock begins

**Why Use FSSCS vs. FSD?**:
- Sometimes the conveyance is complicated
- Grantor may not want to automatically punish someone for breach
- Allows flexibility when conditions may be ambiguous

#### 3. Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation (FSSEL)

**Characteristics**:
- Can use either duration OR conditional language ("so long as" OR "on condition that")
- **Key difference**: Upon breach, property goes to **B** (third party), NOT back to O
- Language typically includes "then to B" or "otherwise to B"

**Formula**: "O to A so long as Blackacre is used for residential purposes, otherwise to B"

**Breakdown**:
- O: Conveys and has no future interest (unless specified)
- A: Has **fee simple subject to executory limitation**
- B: Has **executory interest** (future interest that divests A)
- **Upon breach**: Property goes to B (not O)
- **B gets property**: In fee simple absolute (NO restrictions carry over to B unless explicitly stated)

**Important Distinction**:
- First two defeasible fees go back to O upon breach
- FSSEL goes to B (third party) upon breach

## III. Life Estates

### A. Basic Life Estate

#### 1. Common Law
- **Formula**: "O to A for life"
- Still creates a life estate

#### 2. Modern Law
- **Formula**: "O to A for life"
- **MUST contain "for life"** - that's how we know it's a life estate
- A has present possessory interest in a life estate with **A being the measuring life**

#### 3. Future Interest
- When life estate conveyed, O retains a **reversion**
- **Reversion**: Property automatically goes back to O (or O's heirs) when A dies

#### 4. Three Types of Life Estates
- Life estate (regular)
- Life estate **pur autre vie** (measured by another's life)
- Defeasible life estates (3 types - see below)

### B. Defeasible Life Estates

Similar structure to defeasible fees, but maximum duration = grantee's life

#### 1. Determinable Life Estate

**Formula**: "O to A for life, so long as Blackacre is used for residential purposes"

**Breakdown**:
- A: Has **determinable life estate**
- O: Retains TWO future interests:
  - **(1) Reversion** (gets it back when A dies)
  - **(2) Possibility of reverter** (gets it back if A breaches)
- **Maximum duration**: A's lifetime
- **Automatic forfeiture** upon breach (goes back to O)

#### 2. Life Estate Subject to Condition Subsequent

**Formula**: "O to A for life, on condition that Blackacre is used for residential purposes, otherwise O reserves the right to re-enter"

**Breakdown**:
- A: Has **life estate subject to condition subsequent**
- O: Retains TWO future interests:
  - **(1) Reversion** (when A dies)
  - **(2) Right of entry** (discretionary if A breaches)
- **No automatic forfeiture** - O must exercise right to re-enter

#### 3. Life Estate Subject to Executory Limitation

**Formula Ambiguity Issue**:
- "O to A for life, so long as used for residential purposes, then to B" = **PROBLEMATIC**
  - Unclear if B gets it (a) upon A's death, OR (b) upon breach
  - Should specify: "But if not used for residential purposes, then to B" (breach trigger)
  - OR: Different conveyance for death vs. breach scenarios

**Key Distinction**:
- If B gets property upon **A's death** = NOT executory interest (it's a **vested remainder**)
- If B gets property upon **breach** = Executory interest

**Maximum Duration**: A's life only
- If A dies without breach → goes back to O (via reversion)
- If A breaches → goes to B (via executory interest)

## IV. Restraints on Alienation

### A. Overview
- **NOT** a type of estate
- A provision that withholds the power to sell, transfer, gift, or mortgage property
- Land is freely alienable (law favors free transfer for tax revenue)
- Commonly tested on exams and bar

### B. Spotting Restraints

**Example**: "O to A so long as Blackacre is used for residential purposes and that A and A's heirs never sell Blackacre"

- The "never sell" provision = restraint on alienation

### C. Analysis Framework

#### 1. **Identify** the restraint provision
- Look for language restricting sale, transfer, gift, or mortgage

#### 2. **Determine validity** (case-by-case, no formal rule)

**Factors to Consider**:
- **Duration**: How long does restraint last?
  - Forever = likely invalid
  - Limited term (e.g., 30 years) = possibly valid
- **Intent/Purpose**: What are grantor's intentions?
  - Good faith purpose (e.g., preserve wildlife) = possibly valid
  - No explanation/arbitrary = likely invalid
  - Discriminatory (race, gender, national origin) = invalid
- **Reasonableness**: Is it reasonable overall?
  - Blanket restraint with no explanation = invalid
  - Limited duration + legitimate purpose = possibly valid

#### 3. **Remedy if Invalid**
- **Strike/void the restraint provision**
- Read conveyance as if restraint doesn't exist
- Use a pencil and cross it out

### D. Effect on Estates

**Example**: "O to A so long as used for residential purposes, and that Blackacre is never sold, otherwise to B"

**Analysis**:
- Initial classification: A has FSSEL (or FSSCS)
- Restraint = "never sold"
- Restraint is **indefinite** (forever), no stated purpose, not reasonable
- **Remedy**: Cross out "and that Blackacre is never sold, otherwise to B"
- **Result**: A has **fee simple absolute**

**Key Point**: Restraint based on **use** = different from restraint on **alienation**
- "Used for residential purposes" = valid limitation on USE
- "Never sell Blackacre" = restraint on ALIENATION (likely invalid if indefinite)

### E. Exam Tips
- 25-30% of essay questions contain restraints
- Always check validity of interests created
- Look for "validity" language in interrogatories
- Discuss even if not explicitly asked

### F. Three Types of Restraints
1. **Disabling restraint** - (see rule statement materials)
2. **Forfeiture restraint** - (see rule statement materials)
3. **Promissory restraint** - (see rule statement materials)

## V. Doctrine of Waste

### A. Overview
- **NOT** an estate type
- A **remedy** that future interest holders can assert
- Primarily applicable to **life estates** (not fees)
- Future interest holder must be nearly guaranteed to get property

### B. When It Applies

**Scenario**: "O to A for life, then to B"
- A = present possessory interest holder (life estate)
- B = future interest holder (will get property when A dies)
- If A harms the property, B's future interest is prejudiced

### C. Three Types of Waste

#### 1. Affirmative Waste
- **Intentionally** damaging the land permanently
- **Example**: A is present interest holder, land has oil
  - A cannot extract all oil, reap all profits, and leave B with nothing

#### 2. Negligent Waste (Permissive Waste)
- **Omissions** in upkeeping the property
- Failure to maintain property
- **Example**: Not fixing foundation, allowing property to become dilapidated, weeds everywhere

#### 3. Ameliorative Waste
- **Changing the character** of the property
- Even if it increases value, it may burden future interest holder
- **Example**: Converting residential Newport Beach home into commercial clown circus
  - Property value may increase
  - BUT: Changes nature from residential to commercial
  - Future interest holder now burdened with managing business, taxes, etc.
  - Goes beyond what grantor contemplated

**Not Ameliorative Waste**:
- Cosmetic changes (e.g., remodeling bathroom)
- Changes that don't alter fundamental character (residential to residential)
- Must change from residential → commercial, or commercial → industrial

### D. Remedies for Future Interest Holder

Three potential remedies:
1. **Sue for damages**
2. **Seek an injunction** to stop the activity
3. **Possibly divest** present interest holder (unclear - research question)

### E. Important Limitations
- Must act **before** A dies
- After A dies, may only be able to sue A's estate for damages
- Most applicable when future interest is nearly certain (life estates)
- Less applicable to fees (A could have fee forever, may never go to B)

## VI. Key Exam Strategies

### A. Systematic Approach
1. **Is it fee or life?** (First question always)
2. **What kind?** (Absolute? Tail? Defeasible?)
3. **If defeasible, which type?** (Look at language)
4. **Check for restraints** (Spot "never sell/transfer" language)
5. **Assess validity** (Duration, intent, reasonableness)

### B. Language Cues
- **Words of duration** → Determinable ("so long as," "while," "until")
- **Conditional words** → Condition Subsequent ("on condition that," "provided that")
- **"Then to B"/"otherwise to B"** → Executory limitation
- **"Never sell/transfer/convey"** → Restraint on alienation (analyze validity)

### C. Remember
- This material is heavily tested
- Know your rule statements (see materials provided)
- Practice multiple examples (explanations are always the same)
- This is "another language" - requires repetition
- Material gets harder in coming weeks
- Use charts/tables provided in emails

## VII. Additional Concepts

### A. Heirs
- **Determined at death** (NOT before)
- You don't know who your heirs are while alive
- Common mistake: calling living children "heirs"
- Heirs of B are unascertainable until B dies

### B. Modern Law vs. Common Law
- Professor uses "iPhone law" = modern law
- O to A = fee simple absolute (modern)
- O to A and his heirs = fee simple absolute (common law)
- Most examples use modern law unless specified

### C. Conveyance Can Pass Through Generations
- Fee simple: Can pass to A's heirs, then their heirs, forever
- Life estate: Stops at A's death (or measuring life's death)
- Restrictions travel with property through successive owners (unless struck down)
