# Property - Session 04

## Transcript

John Rogers: Alright, I guess we get started.

John Rogers: Anyone have any questions from last week?

John Rogers: When I was in person.

John Rogers: Right No questions.

John Rogers: Does anybody know where… My counterpart is Professor Dolmagian in her class. She teaches Tuesday nights online only.

John Rogers: Anybody know?

John Rogers: Do people know how to say things?

Clarissa Terrazas: No, Professor, I don't know.

John Rogers: You don't know how to say things?

Clarissa Terrazas: No, like, I don't know where Professor Damaljian is.

John Rogers: I gotcha.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: just wondering, I haven't spoken to her about a final exam. I assume we're gonna take the same one,

John Rogers: Professor Safarian, I think started teaching property in 2017, 18.

John Rogers: And, we've just given separate final exams, because he usually likes to teach, or give

John Rogers: Different, untraditional final, kind of, like, short answer.

John Rogers: versus the traditional, just, essay with interrogatories. So we've typically just

John Rogers: not have the same file. I don't know if Professor Dolmagian and myself will or not.

John Rogers: But, …

John Rogers: But, you guys are more than welcome to attend her class. If you don't like me, you can always attend her class and get credit, so you'll never have to see me if you don't want to.

John Rogers: … I just don't know if you can take Professor Safarian's class, because he's… he started…

John Rogers: Teaching, I think, on page, like, 300?

John Rogers: And he goes, and then veers back around.

John Rogers: So you… It's just different, different material right now.

John Rogers: So there's no questions at all? There's not many issues, no problems… Getting the material okay?

John Rogers: a hard…

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So what we could probably do next week is, I'll try to look for an adverse possession question that I've given out before. Maybe we can just go over it together.

John Rogers: Do you kind of have an idea how it's tested, and… Test your knowledge on it.

John Rogers: But as I said before, a lot of students underestimate it. I get a lot of very substandard …

John Rogers: responses?

John Rogers: So please, just don't underestimate it.

John Rogers: Seems easy, doesn't seem that complicated, but there could be some rabbit holes in it.

John Rogers: So watch out for the rabbit holes.

John Rogers: … If you're too timid to ask me questions, You can always call me.

John Rogers: always available to talk to you if you want. I promise I won't be mean to you, or snarky at you, or make you feel stupid, don't worry.

John Rogers: …

John Rogers: But I am available, you can always call me, I'd love to hear from you. As I told my class last night, I teach evidences… I teach evidence, but I told my evidence class

John Rogers: Look, let's be friends now, let's not be friends week 14.

John Rogers: So, week 14 is usually when I start Getting really popular, and…

John Rogers: Everybody wants to talk to me, and… I don't know, it's kind of weird. I don't know why. Hmm.

John Rogers: But anyways, let's be friends now, okay?

John Rogers: No.

Yessenia Soria: Yes, sir.

Yessenia Soria: It's me, friends?

Yessenia Soria: Yeah, I want to be your friend.

John Rogers: Okay.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, I… yes, I'm gonna be… I'm gonna admit, I do not ask questions, because I feel like I'm… you're gonna make me feel stupid, and I don't like feeling like that. So, but I am gonna ask…

Yessenia Soria: Question. So, I did do my briefs for this week.

Yessenia Soria: But, …

Yessenia Soria: I think I don't… I don't think I did it correctly, because, I mean, property is something I've never briefed before. I am a paralegal, so I kind of brief a little different.

Yessenia Soria: So… I was just trying to see, like.

Yessenia Soria: the issue, I could get the issue, but the rule, like, how do I get the rule? Like, is it something that…

Yessenia Soria: we talked about? I mean, or is it's a new chapter? Is it something we're going to learn that week? Like, this week, we're going to talk about those cases?

Yessenia Soria: Because I'm in week 4.

Yessenia Soria: So…

Yessenia Soria: the limits and possibilities of real property, personal property, and electro… intellectual property. So do I supposed to be, the rule on the… on the cases that I'm briefing using this chapter, or the cases that… the rules that we used in the previous chapters? I'm not sure….

John Rogers: Sure. I mean, each chapter is gonna have its own set of rules.

Yessenia Soria: So it's going to be rules that we haven't studied this week, then, right?

John Rogers: I think so? I'm… I'm not sure.

John Rogers: Give me, like, an example, like, what case are you referring to?

Yessenia Soria: like the… the International News Service and Associated Press. I know what happened, I know the parties are involved.

Yessenia Soria: Under the Supreme Court of the United States, 1919,

Yessenia Soria: But I don't know what role.

Yessenia Soria: to use for this. I don't know if it's…

Yessenia Soria: a real prop? I mean, I don't know, maybe I'm just confused.

Yessenia Soria: Should I be using, like, adverse procession?

Yessenia Soria: It's just about a newspaper, or stealing…

Yessenia Soria: Okay, so I guess I'm just confused.

John Rogers: Okay, first and foremost, I don't want to make you feel stupid at all, because guess what? I think you're perfect, okay? I think you're perfect every way.

John Rogers: …

John Rogers: Right now, if you just know the parties, you understand what's going on in the case, you're in an A+.

John Rogers: Okay? So don't worry about the rules and figuring it out, because the international news in some of those cases we'll cover, aren't tested. They're just kind of…

John Rogers: Interesting things to kind of know about.

John Rogers: Maybe get you to stink a little bit, but they're not, … to…

John Rogers: important. I've never seen them tested.

Yessenia Soria: Yeah, because they're long cases, and I literally read them, like, 3-4 times, and I'm like, what am I missing?

Yessenia Soria: Right.

Yessenia Soria: The cases for this week kind of were kind of long, like, 6, 7, 10 pages. I was like, oh my god. Okay, alright, I guess I'm okay. I'm not perfect, because I know I'm not getting an A, because….

John Rogers: I think you're perfect. So, … So don't worry.

John Rogers: Don't worry about it.

John Rogers: Really what I really, really, really want you to focus on is mostly just adverse possession, just really understanding that, lost, mislayed, abandoned, just kind of just general concepts of stuff.

John Rogers: Okay? Don't get too caught up in it.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, thank you, Professor.

John Rogers: But, you know what? Here's something.

John Rogers: if… if I talk to you in a way that…

John Rogers: not you, in general, but just everyone in general. Just remember something, okay? You're entering a profession, okay?

John Rogers: where opposing counsel is going to drown you. They're gonna stomp on your face, and when you need air, they're gonna keep

John Rogers: you know, Putting their foot on your face and keeping you underwater.

Yessenia Soria: Yes.

John Rogers: So, I'm not talking to you, I'm just talking to everyone, but….

Yessenia Soria: No, I know.

John Rogers: So… Don't ever get stammered.

John Rogers: if I talk to you in a way that… you…

John Rogers: If I'm snarking or something like that, okay?

Yessenia Soria: Okay, I will take it personal, then.

John Rogers: I'm talking to everyone right now.

Yessenia Soria: I know.

John Rogers: But, just remember, You're entering a profession where people aren't nice to you.

John Rogers: And you have to start building your confidence now.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: like…

John Rogers: you will go to court, and you will get destroyed one day. One day in your career, you will, okay?

John Rogers: And it happened to me.

John Rogers: And it was the most embarrassing experience Probably of my life.

John Rogers: And I always share the story, because…

John Rogers: I fully will fall on the sword and say, yeah, I screwed up.

John Rogers: But it was really embarrassing, and after that, I totally changed.

John Rogers: I was… had a case in federal court.

John Rogers: And for those of you that don't know, federal court is far more rule-following than superior court.

John Rogers: You're going against federal judges, I'm going against federal prosecutors.

John Rogers: varied… serious.

John Rogers: So we want… we agreed to continue a trial out, and client was charged, like, bank fraud, wire fraud, all that stuff. This was, like, 10 years ago.

John Rogers: So, me and the prosecutor. The prosecutor is a very established lawyer. He clerked, probably finished top of his class at Yale, and…

John Rogers: I know he wrote a couple opinions for, Chief Justice John Roberts, clerk for John Roberts, very established lawyer.

John Rogers: So, we… filled out a stipulation to continue. We both agreed to continue the trial, okay?

John Rogers: I said, do we have to clear the date with the clerk? And he says, no, don't problem, they'll figure out a date. We just, you know, propose it.

John Rogers: So, I file the stipulation.

John Rogers: At 11 o'clock.

John Rogers: And, … at 12 o'clock.

John Rogers: We all get this notice that says, Everybody is coming to court.

John Rogers: Everyone, defendant, counsel, ordered to appear tomorrow morning at 7 AM.

John Rogers: And I went… TF.

John Rogers: My client lives in Colorado.

John Rogers: So I had to call my client and say, get on the next flight to LA now.

John Rogers: And he was mad.

John Rogers: And he said, why? And I said, I don't know.

John Rogers: If you drive from Colorado here, I don't know how long that takes, but it's not necessarily an easy drive, so he had to fly. Thank God he arrived.

John Rogers: So we go to court, I'm there at, like, 6.50.

John Rogers: And, … The judge doesn't even open the courtroom till, like, 9 o'clock.

John Rogers: So we're just outside the courtroom for 2 hours.

John Rogers: Me, the prosecutor, and my client.

John Rogers: Then, the clerk opens the door and just says, have a seat.

John Rogers: So, … We waited.

John Rogers: Until 1 o'clock in the afternoon.

John Rogers: We're there till 1 o'clock.

John Rogers: And, takes the bench.

John Rogers: And, … He says, Mr. Rogers.

John Rogers: Step up to the lectern.

John Rogers: I got some questions for you.

John Rogers: And I went.

John Rogers: Oh, no.

John Rogers: Always keep my cool. I'll never appear to be nervous, but I was.

John Rogers: And, he was mad.

John Rogers: And, … Her first question was, do you know how to read?

John Rogers: Keep in mind, my client is about 10 feet away looking at me. This whole time.

John Rogers: We don't even know why we're there.

John Rogers: And he says, do you read left to right? Do you understand this? Do you know how to follow rules? Is your client… did your client pay you money to represent him?

John Rogers: And I said, yes, yes. And he paid you money to follow the rules.

John Rogers: And I just went, yes, and it was really embarrassing. And he says, did you read my rules? And the judge's rules is, like, 70 pages. Very thick stuff. I'm happy to email it to you guys.

John Rogers: very overwhelming.

John Rogers: Keep in mind, this is a United States judge appointed by the President of the United States. There's nothing that you can do. They are there for life. They are very, very… they can be very tough.

John Rogers: And he made me… read. He says, open my rules up.

John Rogers: And I didn't have them with me, and I said, I don't have it, I have my iPad. No, I have my cell phone at the time. And he says, open your cell phone.

John Rogers: can't have a cell phone out in federal court, but I have my phone out. And he says, read from page 1. And I sat and read 19 pages out loud.

John Rogers: For, like, 20 minutes.

John Rogers: And he says, stop.

John Rogers: And he says, did you read that? And I said, yes. And he says, did you read that prior to filing the stipulation?

John Rogers: And I said, I… Forgot, and blah blah blah, and then he just laid into me and says.

John Rogers: you are representing someone that paid you money, you don't know how to follow the rules, how do you expect to represent someone adequately? That's so unacceptable, you're supposed to follow the rules, blah blah blah blah.

John Rogers: Again, this is right in front of my client. My client, who is not a lawyer, is looking at this whole thing going, thinking I really screwed up.

John Rogers: And he just laid into me for 30 minutes.

John Rogers: And there was nothing I could do.

John Rogers: And he says, have a seat.

John Rogers: So I sit down after about…

John Rogers: Almost an hour of getting berated.

John Rogers: And then, I never forgot what he did. He looks over at the prosecutor, and he pointed at the prosecutor, and he says, and YOU!

John Rogers: You know better than that.

John Rogers: And he laid into him for about 45 minutes.

John Rogers: And then at the very end, he said.

John Rogers: Your request to continue the trial. Denied. Walked right off the bench.

John Rogers: It was… awful. It was the worst experience, because he was belittling me.

John Rogers: Making me second-guess my intellect, that I was even smart enough to be a lawyer, all that. All because I did not clear the date with his clerk.

John Rogers: And then my client fired me after that.

John Rogers: I don't blame him.

John Rogers: I don't blame… I would have done the same thing. It was so embarrassing.

John Rogers: But ever since then, I said, I have to follow the rules.

John Rogers: So I'll always follow the rules.

John Rogers: So, it's a really big lesson for me,

John Rogers: And just remember, you're gonna be encountering things like that, too.

John Rogers: And, Don't get stammered.

John Rogers: get confident.

John Rogers: Okay.

Yessenia Soria: Thank you. I mean, I'm the kind of person that likes to be prepared. Like, when I first got your syllabus, I literally, that same day, ordered my book. I had my book, like, by the weekend.

Yessenia Soria: I read the chapter, I did my briefs, and I was like, I wanted to be on top of my game, so when I got stuck with this, I was like, oh my god, like, I didn't know how to do it. You know, like, with crim law, you know the rule, you know the issue, you know your analysis, you know what to write, but with this, I'm like.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, all I know right now is adverse possession, and you know, we're going to learn about the chattels today, and I just got stuck, and I got… I got afraid, and I was embarrassed to say, but…

Yessenia Soria: since you said that, I'm like, alright, I'm just gonna tell him. He's probably gonna make a smart comment, but I'm okay, I'll take it. You know, I'm here to learn.

John Rogers: It's okay, don't worry. I don't get paid a lot of money to teach, but I'm here to help you, so don't worry.

John Rogers: So, with that being said, does anybody have any questions over the material that we've covered?

Yessenia Soria: Speak now.

John Rogers: It's okay. Shoot me a text, write me a private message.

John Rogers: … Or whatever, okay?

John Rogers: And if you write me a private message, I'll never reveal who you are.

John Rogers: Okay, so we left off last class on… gifts.

John Rogers: gifts.

John Rogers: what constitutes a gift, and when is it required… what is required to be a gift? And we went over that… that wedding or engagement ring scenario, that… sorry, fiasco.

John Rogers: … GIFs are… not typically tested. I've never tested GIFs in this class. I guess it could come up.

John Rogers: I think it's more appropriately tested in community property.

John Rogers: So if you take Professor Zand, or whoever teaches it, There'll be gifts.

John Rogers: Because gifts constitute separate property.

John Rogers: …

John Rogers: But how do you know when something is yours? If someone gives you something, what is required for that to be legally binding to be yours?

Dove night: say gifts constitute… Something?

John Rogers: Well, when you're married.

Dove night: Dude.

John Rogers: If you receive a gift from someone, that is separate property. You don't gotta share it. That's mine. It's my gift.

Dove night: Thank you.

John Rogers: Pink.

John Rogers: Double check.

John Rogers: Community property is one of those classes that begins with C-O-M, and I'm… I definitely don't do that.

John Rogers: … But… What is yours?

John Rogers: Now, there has to be the intentions.

John Rogers: So, the grantor has to intend to divorce themselves from title. So, if I say, I want to give you something, is want present intent, or is it future? I WILL give you this diamond necklace.

John Rogers: will… Shows some type of future intent, but not present intent.

John Rogers: This laptop computer is yours.

John Rogers: So there has to be some type of intentions behind it.

John Rogers: there has to be delivery, and delivery is usually the crux of the analysis. Not always, but there's actual delivery, so I love you to death, I'm giving you this ring. This ring is yours, and I'm physically delivering it to you and putting it in your hands, okay?

John Rogers: That's actual delivery.

John Rogers: But… If that's tested, that's not fun.

John Rogers: So, what becomes very gray is constructive or symbolic.

John Rogers: And symbolic is a form of constructive.

John Rogers: So, think of symbolic as something that is symbolic to … the gift.

John Rogers: So, for example, if… Long time ago, in the common law days, oftentimes when people sold property.

John Rogers: They would either hand over some form of a key or a clot of dirt, symbolizing the property, and that's what helped transfer, that was the delivery of the land.

John Rogers: If I sell you Students, my property.

John Rogers: Do I just kind of, like.

John Rogers: Dig into the soil and throw it in a truck and just kind of deliver it to you?

John Rogers: Like, throw it in the truck and, like, drive it over to you? No! I give you the, actual earth. The earth.

John Rogers: I give you the soil, it's yours, you can have your water balloon flights on my property.

John Rogers: … I believe I mentioned last week, like, when someone turns Sweet 16, …

John Rogers: They get a new car, a car on their 16th birthday, which used to be really cool, and…

John Rogers: now Uber's is kind of… Torpedoed that, but nonetheless, …

John Rogers: if I were to give a card, give a card to a 16-year-old, and maybe I'd put the key into, like, a little small box, and that key would symbolize the card.

John Rogers: Constructive delivery.

John Rogers: is valid.

John Rogers: Only when.

John Rogers: Actual delivery is impractical or impossible.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, if I wanted to give you a car, gift you a car, would I just pick up?

John Rogers: car, and… Hand you the car?

Maddy Kosh (2): You mean physically?

John Rogers: Yeah!

Maddy Kosh (2): No, obviously not.

John Rogers: Well, I mean, I'm pretty strong.

Maddy Kosh (2): Okay, I don't care how strong you are, it's impossible.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: You're right, Kay.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: there's a way of constructively delivering that through some type of instrument of some sort, maybe like a card or key, card key, or something like that. So, that is executed

John Rogers: and legal, when actual delivery is impractical or impossible.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Does that make sense?

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, I'm sorry, constructive and symbolic are two different things, right?

John Rogers: Symbolic is, a form of constructive.

John Rogers: But you could treat them separately. I don't know what I had in my notes that I gave you. I think it was, like, constructive slash symbolic, maybe? I'm not sure. Double check.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay.

gevorg kulikyan: Thank you.

John Rogers: Not sure.

Yessenia Soria: It's on page 14 of your outline.

John Rogers: I hate the word outline, so I just say notes.

Yessenia Soria: Oh, of the notes.

John Rogers: Well, I don't stop to you, I'm just saying… I don't… I don't say it.

John Rogers: … But…

John Rogers: I hope, by the way, I hope my notes are helpful, at least. Gives you a little bit of guidance.

Amir Akbari: That's perfect.

John Rogers: Who said that?

Yessenia Soria: Oh, God.

Amir Akbari: I did, I did.

John Rogers: What a lovely comment. Oh!

John Rogers: I knew I was flawless.

Yessenia Soria: Yeah, it helps, especially when you print it color. I love it.

John Rogers: Oh, love. I love the L word in there, too. You know, I wish everyone else was like you guys.

John Rogers: Everyone else should be like them.

John Rogers: … So… it's delivery.

John Rogers: … constructive or symbolic.

John Rogers: And then there has to be an acceptance of some sort.

John Rogers: So, what happens, like, if you say, sweetheart, I love you, marry me, here's the ring, and she's like, no, I can't, oh, just put it on, but I can't, I can't. Or, like, a necklace, or something like that. No, no, please, no, no, no, don't give me something. …

John Rogers: It could be kind of… gray, but for the most part, if something is valuable.

John Rogers: Objectively valuable, like a…

John Rogers: very expensive baseball card, or something like that, and I give it to you, and you don't deny it?

John Rogers: It's… the presumption is that you accept it.

John Rogers: if I don't… accept it. So, in order to not accept.

John Rogers: It… there has to be some type of act on my part.

John Rogers: That evidences, … that I don't want it. So I say, I don't want this, I push it back.

John Rogers: But if I do nothing, can you give me this very expensive baseball card?

John Rogers: And I just hold onto it.

John Rogers: then the presumption is, is that I accepted it.

John Rogers: Questions on gifts?

Dove night: So, you said, … Maybe if you get a gift, and you don't deny it.

Dove night: Then the presumption is, is… there's acceptance.

John Rogers: Yeah, it's presumed, yeah.

Dove night: Thank you.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

Sennett Devermont: Question would be, would the symbolic delivery of a car rather than the keys more be like the pink slip?

John Rogers: Sure.

Sennett Devermont: Or it'd be… it could be either….

John Rogers: I mean, the pink slip is…

John Rogers: more of constructive. It's an instrument of some sort. So, I would say that that's probably more constructive.

John Rogers: You don't really need to…

John Rogers: If… if a fact pattern, for example, is hundreds of years before the iPhone, then yeah, you could probably say symbolic, but for the most part, you can get away with just saying constructive delivery, because it's just not manual delivery.

John Rogers: But I would say for the pink slip, that would be constructive delivery.

John Rogers: What is symbolic to the car?

John Rogers: car keys… attire.

John Rogers: It's a tire.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

John Rogers: I guess we could go into the case Newman versus Boast. I believe that's the case I want to go into. I don't want to spend too much time on it, …

John Rogers: But… it's been so long, I don't remember it.

John Rogers: I'm wondering if one of you brilliant souls can help me.

John Rogers: And you would absolutely be melting my heart if you… Want to do the case.

John Rogers: I'm probably in a better mood, because I'm home, and not in the physical world.

John Rogers: So… But I do have court tomorrow in Van Nuys, so I'm not very happy.

John Rogers: Regardless.

John Rogers: Anyone, any volunteers?

Dove night: What page is that.

Karen Hernandez: It's page 120.

Dove night: Thank you.

Karen Hernandez: You're welcome.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Professor, this is John. I can do it, I just don't have my casebook open in front of me, so I'm just gonna read down my notes, if that's okay?

John Rogers: Well, so far, you're doing better than everyone else.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Right, I'm batting a pretty good average.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Sure, let me knock this out. …

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Newman v. Boast, 1898, correct?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Is that about right?

John Rogers: That sounds about right.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): case?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Supreme Court North Carolina.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): In the history of the case, it originated when Newman, the housekeeper, and alleged Dony, claimed ownership of certain items after the death of Van Pelt, the decedent.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Trial court awarded some of the items, but excluded others. Specifically, some insurance policies that were kept in a bureau. Newman appealed, and it went to the North Carolina Supreme Court.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Some of the facts.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Van Pelt was a wealthy man. He lived with Newman, his longtime housekeeper and caretaker. On his deathbed, he expressed a wish to give Newman

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): All of the property in the house.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): To effectuate this intent, Van Pelt handed Newman the keys to a bureau and other furniture with various items that he kept in the Bureau, and inside the Bureau were those life insurance policies. It says it was worth approximately \$3,000. After his death, Newman claimed ownership of the property, including the Bureau and the contents.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): The argument was that while the handling over the Bureau and its contents was valid, for furniture and household goods, intangible property, like the life insurance required an actual delivery of the documents themselves.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And so Newman argued that the delivery of the keys constitute a constructive delivery, both the Bureau and its contents, to include the policies.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): There's a quote I wrote down from the… from the case that said, take these keys, they are the keys to my bureau and everything in it, I want you to have them, and according to, Van Pelt, that was the quote from… from the deathbed of,

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Of the decedent.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): So the rule under review here is gifting, …

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Does it reach the levels of a valid gift, intent to make, delivery, acceptance?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And the issue is whether the delivery of the keys to the Bureau constituted the delivery as a gift of the life insurance policies as well. Now, the court talked about it, and they said.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): They, … the higher court reaffirmed the strict common law where an article is present and capable of being manually delivered. It must be actually delivered. Handling over the keys was an effective delivery of the Bureau.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And the furniture, since the delivery of such larger items would have been impractical. So the handling of the keys validates a gifting of the bureau itself.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): However, the policies were small, portable, and easily capable of being handed over, and they weren't. So therefore, constructive delivery of the keys for the insurance policies was not enough.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And thus the gift of the Bureau was valid, but the life insurance policies were not. And so the Supreme Court of North Carolina, in their holding that, insofar as the large item of the Bureau was concerned, the keys were satisfied, but the life insurances were not.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And so, they, … Kept the decision.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): That's as far as I got in my notes.

John Rogers: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: Those are very detailed notes.

John Rogers: Question for anyone.

John Rogers: … why didn't… the caretaker, Why didn't she just record

John Rogers: the conversation she had with the decedent with her iPhone.

gevorg kulikyan: 1898.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Dark Age of Time.

John Rogers: So… Was there another person in the room?

John Rogers: Or was it just the two of them?

John Rogers: I think it was just the two of them.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I thought it was just the two of them, I didn't put a third person in my notes.

John Rogers: Silin?

John Rogers: text the caretaker and let me know, but I think she was by herself.

John Rogers: So, this is a problem, and you can kind of get the tone of the opinion from this, is that

John Rogers: There's no one else there to confirm that's what the decedent did.

John Rogers: All we're left with is what the caretaker just said.

John Rogers: Which may be true.

John Rogers: Which… Maybe not.

John Rogers: So fraud was kind of a…

John Rogers: implicit in this.

John Rogers: Opinion.

John Rogers: But… Not saying that she is, just saying.

John Rogers: Anybody could have said what she said.

John Rogers: And there certainly was no cooperation.

John Rogers: Now, the decedent was sick, bedridden, oh, can't move.

John Rogers: And handed over a key to some form of a chest.

John Rogers: And said, this is for you.

John Rogers: Something to the effect of the contents, or the chest is yours, or maybe the contents of the chest is yours, who knows?

John Rogers: And was the decedent able to hand over the key to the caretaker?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yes.

John Rogers: Which, the key is symbolic to the chest.

John Rogers: Or the… whatever it is. The Bureau.

John Rogers: The key opened it.

John Rogers: Inside was the insurance, … Certificate of some sort, I forget what it is.

John Rogers: But I believe, if I'm not mistaken, it was about 2,500?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: 3,000.

John Rogers: 3,000?

John Rogers: Probably enough to buy a very nice home back in 1898.

John Rogers: So… Hmm.

John Rogers: The question is, is… Are the contents of the safe.

John Rogers: incorporated into that bureau.

John Rogers: Whoa.

John Rogers: That's a bit problematic.

John Rogers: The reason is this.

John Rogers: Is that life insurance policy?

John Rogers: Able to be manually delivered to the caretaker.

John Rogers: Take it.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Could have been, yeah.

John Rogers: Could have been.

John Rogers: After all, we know that the decedent handed over the key, right? Why not just hand over the life insurance policy?

John Rogers: since… The life insurance policy Could be manually delivered.

John Rogers: There can be no constructive delivery, remember.

John Rogers: Constructive delivery is only available if…

John Rogers: Actual delivery is impossible or impractical.

John Rogers: And in this instance, that life insurance policy was…

John Rogers: Very well possible to be handed over, and we know that because the dececeded handed over the key.

John Rogers: Caretaker does not get the life insurance. Sorry, but you get the Bureau!

John Rogers: Yeah, you get the bureau.

John Rogers: Question as far as the contents of the home?

John Rogers: Don't really care too much. The meat of what I really want you to extract is that life insurance policy.

John Rogers: And what we're extracting from that is, … when… … …

John Rogers: When a gift is capable of being manually delivered.

John Rogers: Constructive delivery would be ineffective to not legally transfer a gift.

John Rogers: It's in my notes. I wrote it in there.

John Rogers: Questions?

Dove night: So, the gift can be manually delivered. That means that, con- constructive.

Dove night: Delivery is impractical.

John Rogers: No, it means that…

John Rogers: If I can actually deliver a gift to you, manually deliver it to you, here, I'm handing it to you, then I cannot constructively deliver it to you.

Dove night: Okay.

John Rogers: I can only use constructive delivery.

John Rogers: when actual… when manual delivery is impractical or impossible. So, for example, a car. I can't physically pick up a car. I know you all think I can, but I can't, okay?

John Rogers: keys, or I'm gonna give you the title, or something like that.

John Rogers: In… in lieu of the actual car.

Dove night: Thank you.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor?

Agnes Gholoonian: You can assume that a person walks around with their keys, or has their keys on them, but if somebody is bedridden, I mean, it's a little impractical to assume that they're going to have their

Agnes Gholoonian: life insurance policy on them, right? I mean, yeah, it's easy to lift and give to someone, but…

Agnes Gholoonian: It's not something that you carry around.

John Rogers: Sure.

John Rogers: That's why you have to look at it more objectively.

John Rogers: So, although this decedent could get out of bed.

John Rogers: what was to stop this decedent from asking the caretaker, open the chest, give me this, and then I give it to you?

John Rogers: But you always have to kind of look at things objectively, because if it was more subjective, then…

John Rogers: You know, there would be wild explanations.

John Rogers: … Everything should always be measured objectively to a certain extent.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay.

Agnes Gholoonian: Understood, thank you.

John Rogers: Objectively. Objectively. Reasonable.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Am I gonna have friends week 14, or am I gonna have friends next week?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): This week, next week, and week 14, you got friends all the time, Professor, we're here for you.

John Rogers: All right. Well, I certainly have a friend in my evidence class.

John Rogers: Because, …

John Rogers: I told him, I said, hey, you guys could call me anytime you want, I will even privately tutor you.

John Rogers: And oh boy, she calls me every day, and we go over everything, and she's on it.

John Rogers: So, hey, if that's cool.

John Rogers: If I'm willing to take as long as you need to, so you understand this truth, you can call me.

John Rogers: Take advantage of that.

John Rogers: What's wrong with you?

John Rogers: I want to go into… Acquisition by creation?

John Rogers: I always find these, these three cases that we're gonna go over very interesting.

John Rogers: And, I apologize.

John Rogers: But I believe the first case in regards to it is the international news.

John Rogers: I'm just not sure if that is the first one. We're only gonna go about maybe 3 of them.

John Rogers: And I don't know if I told you, like, you have to read it or not. Yeah, copyright, patent law. So, we'll go over international news, we'll go over Diamond versus…

John Rogers: You know what, did we go over that?

John Rogers: I think the diamond case, too.

John Rogers: more diamond and… International news, so 141.

John Rogers: I always find this to be very interesting, and we usually talk about this, this used to be, like, the first,

John Rogers: first day of class. So when I talked about acquisition by discovery, then the next would be acquisition by creation.

John Rogers: But it's funny, because how does… How does someone…

John Rogers: This is the news, so how does someone create the news? So, if 9-11 happened.

John Rogers: We have some post-9-11 babies in here.

John Rogers: So, if 9-11 happened, how do I have an interest in 9-11

John Rogers: Where I can stop other news outlets and agencies from reporting that.

John Rogers: And what is the news? Who is the news? Does anybody know who the news is?

John Rogers: You don't know the news?

John Rogers: Freedom of the press!

John Rogers: Who's the press?

gevorg kulikyan: The people?

John Rogers: That is correct.

John Rogers: Everyone is the press. You are the press. I'm the press.

John Rogers: Just because we don't have

John Rogers: you know, millions of viewers, or some type of huge podcast doesn't mean that we are not the press. I can easily go outside and just start writing down, you know, what everyone's house looks like from the street or public sidewalk. You may not like it, or I could take photos, you may not like it, but

John Rogers: hey, I'm putting it on my website that maybe I myself only look at, but I'm still… the press.

John Rogers: It's a First Amendment Act 50.

John Rogers: So… How?

John Rogers: Me.

John Rogers: You, a member of the press.

John Rogers: How do you get an interest in it to the point where you can… Stop, for example.

John Rogers: Other news outlets.

John Rogers: From reporting on something.

John Rogers: I have an interest in 9-11. You can't report on these planes

John Rogers: Crashing into this building, yet 3 buildings fall, … …

John Rogers: how do I stop that if I can?

John Rogers: I… I took it on my own pre-iPhone Razer phone. No one even knows what that is.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Loved my race.

Maddy Kosh (2): Yes, we do.

John Rogers: What's that?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): If you didn't have a razor, you weren't cool.

John Rogers: … So… how do I stop them? I took it… I… I captured it myself.

John Rogers: I'm producing it, and I want to stop everyone from doing it.

John Rogers: How does someone get an interest in the news to stop everyone else from reporting on it?

Sennett Devermont: You own the platforms that display it?

John Rogers: Okay, so if a nuclear weapon was detonated.

John Rogers: in downtown Los Angeles.

John Rogers: And I'm in… Las Vegas.

John Rogers: And I capture this on my iPhone.

John Rogers: And I put it on my, … TikTok account.

John Rogers: Does that mean that… no one else…

John Rogers: Can report on it without my consent?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Gotta copyright it.

John Rogers: Well, just, what about in general, like…

John Rogers: A nuclear weapon was detonated in Hollywood.

John Rogers: I was the first to capture it on my video and report on it.

John Rogers: Does that mean no one else can report on it?

Amir Akbari: It would be a republisher.

John Rogers: I mean, how do I have the rights, if I do?

John Rogers: to… that… incident.

John Rogers: Can I sue? So, if I want to sue…

John Rogers: ABC News that's reporting on it, can I sue them and say, nope, I captured this first, I wrote about it first.

Dove night: You may… you may need a copyright or some legal… entities showing that you…

Dove night: owned or something, I don't know.

Amir Akbari: Well… They should cite you?

Amir Akbari: Like, reference here?

John Rogers: Well, what happens if they're not copying anything that I'm saying? What happens if they're not…

John Rogers: republishing any of my photographs or videos. They're just reporting an incident.

Amir Akbari: ….

John Rogers: New clear weapons?

Amir Akbari: They are primary publisher, right?

John Rogers: What I'm asking is this. A nuclear weapon was detonated in LA.

Amir Akbari: Hmm.

John Rogers: Does that mean Japan can't report it without asking me first?

Amir Akbari: Yes.

Jude Seleck: Everybody can report. There's no limitation.

Jude Seleck: But if they use your, photograph, I have your consent?

Jude Seleck: You have copyright on your photograph, the picture you have taken.

Jude Seleck: But the event itself cannot be copyrighted, so everybody has the right to access it.

John Rogers: That's what I'm getting at, the news.

Jude Seleck: Yeah.

John Rogers: the news. I don't care much about photographs or videos, but the news itself. So why…

John Rogers: why can't I have an interest in the news, Thank you.

Amir Akbari: It's a public matter?

Amir Akbari: It's a public matter.

John Rogers: So, can someone have an interest in the news, then? Or is….

Dove night: Beautiful.

Jude Seleck: Yes.

Sennett Devermont: That's sick.

Mireya Gonzalez: I mean, I would say that facts in a newscast or, like, article aren't necessarily property. It's more so just, like, the facts of a particular event or, like, news article or whatever they're writing on.

John Rogers: I'm just talking about… Shh, okay.

John Rogers: Can I have some interest in the news, an incident?

John Rogers: over… other outlets, other… News agencies, other… People of the press.

Sennett Devermont: Yeah, by having info or content or some… Yeah, information that others don't.

John Rogers: Like, what?

Sennett Devermont: Like, an interview or footage of the accident, or…

Sennett Devermont: Yeah, information that someone sends you.

Sennett Devermont: That's relevant.

John Rogers: But the interview that someone sends you About an incident?

Sennett Devermont: An interview you take of the incident from someone that was there.

John Rogers: But what happens if I don't care about someone copying?

John Rogers: any photos, videos. I'm talking about the actual incident itself.

John Rogers: Does someone have an interest in the incident itself?

John Rogers: That no one else can report about it.

John Rogers: or… Eventually report on it.

John Rogers: 9-11!

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I don't think so.

John Rogers: will… Remember… There's also… creating this.

John Rogers: How do you create news?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Create news or gather news?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I mean, I think….

John Rogers: Find Newton.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah.

John Rogers: worthy.

John Rogers: Here's the thing.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I think if you're spending tangible assets to gather the news.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): You can… should have some level of first rights. There should be some…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): But you don't own them, you can't… Once it's.

John Rogers: Public actress, do you have an interest in the news?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): It was an interesting question.

Maddy Kosh (2): Word of mouth?

John Rogers: What does… Two questions.

John Rogers: What does an investigative reporter do? And two, if they didn't have some interest in their investigative reporting and discoveries?

John Rogers: Who would ever be an investigative reporter?

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: I could be working for the Los Angeles Times, and I wanna… I'm an investigative reporter, I'm looking into things, I wanna look into the LA County Jail.

John Rogers: I want to know what they're feeding the inmates. And I find out that they're feeding inmates Rats.

John Rogers: And not milk, but mulk.

John Rogers: That's deep.

John Rogers: … And….

Maddy Kosh (2): What's more?

John Rogers: Look at that.

John Rogers: … And…

John Rogers: I produced this big story based on my efforts and time in uncovering this, that the public was not made aware of.

John Rogers: And I… Drop a bomb on this.

John Rogers: Well, the only reason anyone found out about rats being served in LA County Jail for breakfast is because of what I did.

John Rogers: Other news agencies, outlets, and members of the press must respect that.

John Rogers: So, they have to give credit to me, respect that interest, but not forever.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: it is… There's no clear line of when that be… When, exactly, … These agencies can report it.

John Rogers: But oftentimes, you see Like, news outlets?

John Rogers: Like, if you watch television.

John Rogers: it'll say the LA Times reports this discovery. The New York Times discovered this and published this. So they're giving them that credit so that viewers don't think that this news, television news, actually did it themselves.

John Rogers: But a news ally can't just sit and take that and say, oh, LA County Jail has been serving rats!

John Rogers: They have to give credit to the investigative reporter, the agency, the press member.

John Rogers: For a certain period of time.

John Rogers: to ensure that they receive some type of, creditworthiness and economic benefit to it. Because if that was not the case.

John Rogers: then we would never have investigative reporters. It would just be…

John Rogers: No one would ever investigate if they don't receive some type of credit.

John Rogers: Does that make sense?

John Rogers: So… …

John Rogers: look to see if someone created news. Now, if a nuclear weapon detonated in Los Angeles, or 9-11,

John Rogers: That's not the product of investigative reporting. That's a public incident that everyone could see and is affected by, and it's going to be reported upon.

John Rogers: But investigative reporting is different.

John Rogers: Because you have individuals, groups, They're uncovering things of matters of public concern and public interest.

John Rogers: That makes sense?

Dove night: So you're saying that investigative reporting… there wouldn't be any investigative reporters if…

Dove night: Other news outlets didn't give credit to the original reporting.

Dove night: Probably.

John Rogers: I mean, you have to give investigative reporters just…

John Rogers: you and me are investigative reporters. We could just sit down and walk into a police station and start looking around. I'm an investigative reporter. I'm looking to see how often you clean these restrooms, because I'm a

John Rogers: I want to know how much money is being spent on cleaning this restroom.

John Rogers: Okay? So, … you… If… There was no interest attached.

John Rogers: To the news when someone uncovers and creates it.

John Rogers: then that industry would wither away and die, because no one would be incentivized to do it. Other agencies can just rip it off, play it as their own.

John Rogers: So me, by myself, if I investigate and I find out that rats are being served in LA County Jail.

John Rogers: All these other local news outlets would just report that and just bury me.

John Rogers: And the credit that… and effort that I made to uncover this, I would never receive it. So why would I do this?

John Rogers: Unless I get some form of credit.

John Rogers: So there is interest in the news, but did you create it?

John Rogers: And that's… this case.

John Rogers: International news.

John Rogers: Can anyone spend, maybe, 30 seconds going over it for me.

John Rogers: I was dealing with newspapers, right? A newspaper.

John Rogers: I don't really care much to go over it, it's okay, because I've made my point, but it's dealing with newspapers. When was the last time you touched a newspaper?

John Rogers: What's a newspaper?

John Rogers: I teach on Wednesday nights in the Valley. I was thinking about going there and read a newspaper.

John Rogers: And see if anyone's said anything.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Do we still print newspapers? I mean, there… is there circulation still?

Agnes Gholoonian: Yes.

John Rogers: I haven't seen one in a long, long time.

Agnes Gholoonian: I've been stealing my neighbor's newspapers by accident, and I didn't know he was subscribed to it, I just thought it was there.

John Rogers: So what have you been doing with the newspapers, then?

Agnes Gholoonian: I've been reading it, but now I had to stop once I realized somebody's actually paying for it, so….

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Smart to stop, yeah, smart.

Agnes Gholoonian: It was just left in the lobby, I thought it was for everyone.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): What?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I love newspapers, but I haven't seen one.

John Rogers: So… But… you still have people

John Rogers: working for the New York Times, the LA Times.

John Rogers: But my personal concern is that industry is dying.

John Rogers: Because you see a lot of news out. When you watch television, let's suppose you watch, like, ABC News or something, they constantly just say the New York Times is reporting, LA Times discovered.

John Rogers: But… who actually goes directly to the LA Times to get that news?

John Rogers: Seems like LA Times is only getting recognition because other agencies are just reporting on it. So my actual concern is that newspapers are dying.

John Rogers: It's unfortunate.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, yeah.

Dove night: That's because of the internet.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: the internet.

Agnes Gholoonian: it's because the smaller counties that run their newspapers are getting bought out by these larger corporations. These larger corporations are not paying the writers, nobody has any incentive to work. So all the smaller counties that actually have their newspaper and were breaking world news.

Agnes Gholoonian: Are all out of jobs, so that's…

Agnes Gholoonian: It's a… it's a big issue, but….

John Rogers: O.

John Rogers: I totally agree with you, but I just thought it was for a different reason. I thought people just don't like to get their hands dirty anymore, so they just don't get newspapers.

Agnes Gholoonian: Well, I mean, you can subscribe to news organizations online and receive news like that, too. So yeah, of course, the technological world is taking over in certain aspects, but

Agnes Gholoonian: It's just the news is not properly working the way that it was before, because these journalists who were once dedicated to their craft are no longer employed.

John Rogers: Yes?

John Rogers: Yes?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah.

John Rogers: Sure.

John Rogers: The world is a-changin'. The times they are a-changin'.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): What I found interesting about this case in particular was that if I didn't know the date on it, if I didn't see it was 1918,

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I had actually was reading the case thinking it was a more modern piece, because I'm thinking this… the fight over rights, you know, first impression rights, and who broke the story, and who scooped who, and all that. I mean, this is…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): over a century ago, plus, and that argument was taking place back then, so I just think it's… it definitely is relative now, even though it was a longer time ago.

John Rogers: Law still exists to this day?

John Rogers: First Amendment.

John Rogers: I love the First Amendment.

John Rogers: Loved the first of them.

John Rogers: You know, I always get calls from people that are First Amendment auditors.

John Rogers: And it's really funny, because they're not doing anything illegal, and there's always this big uproar.

John Rogers: But I get calls from them all the time, usually out of Lancaster.

John Rogers: I don't know why Lancaster.

John Rogers: I don't go to Lancaster. I stopped going to Lancaster 2 years ago.

John Rogers: Anyways… …

John Rogers: I don't very care very much. I got my point across for international news, but what you really want to know is the interest begins if you create the news, okay?

John Rogers: Efforts of creating the news, uncovering things, through your efforts.

John Rogers: And so, Diamond versus… Chuck Robarti, is that…?

Dove night: Before we go on, what can we take out of acquisition by Creation? What would be the…

Dove night: Keyword, key take from that case?

John Rogers: Well, if you use efforts

John Rogers: to create the news, meaning you spend time, you spend resources in trying to discover this news, create something.

John Rogers: Then you have some form of an interest in that news, where you… where your work product will be protected.

John Rogers: The question is, is for how long?

Dove night: Oh, good.

Dove night: Thank you.

John Rogers: … This case is dealing with

John Rogers: Does anyone know what this case is about?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Patents?

John Rogers: Yeah, well, I mean, what is it… what is it about?

John Rogers: Well…

John Rogers: there was… party created A form of a bacteria.

John Rogers: that broke down.

John Rogers: Crude oil.

John Rogers: In the event of oil spills.

John Rogers: And the petitioners wanted to patent this.

John Rogers: But it was denied.

John Rogers: On the basis that bacteria is a living organism.

John Rogers: And it's a product of nature.

John Rogers: So the patent was denied.

John Rogers: And the petitioner.

John Rogers: appealed.

John Rogers: So the question… is… can… A living organism.

John Rogers: be patented.

John Rogers: Like, I want to patent my dog.

John Rogers: Cat.

John Rogers: How do you pass?

John Rogers: A living organism.

John Rogers: It exists.

John Rogers: So how do you patent it?

Sennett Devermont: If it's man-made, new, and, like, would be useful, So even though it's….

John Rogers: You nailed it.

Sennett Devermont: You are absolutely correct.

John Rogers: Heart melting.

John Rogers: You can't?

John Rogers: Patent a living organism.

John Rogers: Unless that living organism Is the product of human ingenuity.

John Rogers: Because that bacteria is not naturally occurring.

John Rogers: The composites of that bacteria were because of… … Wow.

John Rogers: the ingenuity of mankind, and manufacturing this. … …

John Rogers: It was not naturally occurring.

John Rogers: And when something is not naturally occurring.

John Rogers: And instead, … Is the product of… a new manufacturer.

John Rogers: than that.

John Rogers: Is capable of being.

John Rogers: patented.

Dove night: So, it's because… The organism was… is a product of a… of a human…

Dove night: Ingenuity, so it's capable of being a patent.

John Rogers: Yeah. Because it's not naturally occurring.

Dove night: Thank you.

John Rogers: So, that kind of sucks, because, you know, you have…

John Rogers: Pharmaceutical companies that may have created cancer-curing cells.

John Rogers: And they have patents on that. So if maybe some researchers and

John Rogers: Argentina find and create these cells to say, we can cure cancer, then they could be suppressed and sued and, you know, quieted by the pharmaceuticals because they hold that patent.

John Rogers: Huh. So… sucks.

John Rogers: But, yeah, so… Certain, perhaps, cancer-killing cells are the product of… were manufactured.

John Rogers: composed of… things of… human ingenuity.

John Rogers: So… the, …

John Rogers: Pharmaceuticals get to.

John Rogers: the cure for things.

John Rogers: You don't need these cells, you just need to take this medication.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): That's interesting, Professor, because that kind of explains a little bit behind, CRISPR, and how CRISPR was, patented as a therapy. I never understood that, exactly how they were able to do that, but it was human manufacturer. So this case must have been cited within that patent law dispute.

John Rogers: Perhaps.

John Rogers: Perhaps.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Interesting.

John Rogers: The next case, before we take a break, is Moore v. Regents of the University of California.

John Rogers: Property on one owns person. So…

John Rogers: This is interesting. This is actually a tort case. I love torts! I love torts, it's so great. Oh…

John Rogers: I hate torts.

John Rogers: It's a class that begins with T-O-R, and I'm not good at those classes. I thought torts was hard.

John Rogers: I thought a torch was hard.

John Rogers: I didn't like it, still don't like it.

John Rogers: I like the teachers that teach tworts.

John Rogers: But I don't like torts.

John Rogers: But they will say the same thing for property.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: A question for you all.

John Rogers: What's supposing you need to get your…

John Rogers: You go to your dentist, okay?

John Rogers: And the dentist, tells you, hey,

John Rogers: You need to get your tooth pulled.

John Rogers: You need to pull your tooth.

John Rogers: Because it's rotting.

John Rogers: You need to pull it.

John Rogers: Your dentist doesn't tell you, though, That the tooth…

John Rogers: is your tooth, in particular, you.

John Rogers: It's worth a lot of money.

John Rogers: And a lot of dental researchers would be very interested in your tooth.

John Rogers: But nonetheless, tells you, You need to get this… pulled.

John Rogers: Is she ready?

John Rogers: Your front tooth, just gotta pull it out, okay? Just wanna have a front tooth for a while.

John Rogers: None will notice.

John Rogers: Would you want to know If your truth was valuable.

John Rogers: What difference would it make? I mean, you need your tooth out, so just, you know, you just gotta pull it out.

John Rogers: Do you need to know that it's valuable? You don't need to know, I mean, you just need to get your tooth out.

Dove night: Well, if you can get rich…

Dove night: I guess it might be my… it might be… We're annoying.

John Rogers: Rich?

Dove night: Or….

John Rogers: Does money buy happiness?

Dove night: No.

John Rogers: That is incorrect.

Dove night: Yes, it does.

John Rogers: That's my happiness.

John Rogers: Don't ever forget that! And if you don't think so, just give me your money. I'll be really happy. So, the moral of this class tonight, what you all need to know, is money buys happiness.

John Rogers: And you don't believe me, ask any PI attorney.

John Rogers: getting back.

John Rogers: to the lecture.

John Rogers: Do you want to know that your tooth Could meet you, Rich.

John Rogers: … What difference does it make?

John Rogers: Well, here's the thing.

John Rogers: it almost brings up a little bit of a conflict, in a way. Would you, if you're a dentist.

John Rogers: Told you, hey, your tooth is very expensive, but we need to pull it.

John Rogers: Would you want to get a second opinion?

John Rogers: Probably the third opinion.

John Rogers: To truly know Is this a necessary procedure? I'm gonna lose my tooth.

John Rogers: Question, though.

John Rogers: And that was a bit of the issue here, and it's a torts case. I think it's a conversion case, if I'm not mistaken.

John Rogers: Channels, conversion.

John Rogers: Do you… next question, do you have an interest in… You're… Body?

John Rogers: Your body parts, your organs, your cells…

John Rogers: Do you have an interest in that?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yes.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, I would think so, for sure.

John Rogers: So, so, okay. So, I had my tonsils removed when I was… the summer going into my senior year of high school. It was awful.

John Rogers: But I want to keep my tonsils.

John Rogers: I wanted my doctor to put them in a Ziploc bag so I can keep them.

John Rogers: when I go get a haircut.

John Rogers: The girl that cuts my hair?

John Rogers: I say, put it in a bag, I need to save my hair.

John Rogers: when I shave, I… collect my hair in the sink, and I… Store it in the fridge.

Yessenia Soria: It's your hoarder.

John Rogers: Yes! That's exactly correct!

John Rogers: I collect my fingernails, I need to get my, … when I went to the doctor, and I need to get my, appendix out, I said, save it! Save it!

John Rogers: Can the doctor put my appendix in a… Sandwich… Ziploc bag, and… Give it to me?

John Rogers: Here you go, John. Here's your appendix.

John Rogers: The answer is no.

John Rogers: Okay? They can't do that.

John Rogers: … First off, in this case.

John Rogers: The doctor was in breach. It's a breach of their fiduciary duty.

John Rogers: I don't believe that there was a breach or a finding of conversion, if I'm not mistaken.

John Rogers: …

John Rogers: There are public policy considerations about discarding

John Rogers: The way of handling human biologicals.

John Rogers: …

John Rogers: Human biologicals can be hazardous.

John Rogers: So, in essence, … there was… I guess… once…

John Rogers: Your biologicals, your body parts, your appendix, your tonsils are removed, you lose that interest in them for public policy reasons.

John Rogers: Potentially hazardous.

John Rogers: And… If my flawless… body parts.

John Rogers: We're used for medical research.

John Rogers: It helps progress that.

John Rogers: So there's that backing there as well.

John Rogers: So, in this case, it was funny, because the doctor didn't reveal the…

John Rogers: How lucrative this person's cells were.

John Rogers: …

John Rogers: And there was a breach of fiduciary obligation for the doctor of not revealing that to the patient, because they have to.

John Rogers: But nonetheless, once the cells, or the appendix, or tonsils, Or blood. Your blood.

John Rogers: is extracted from you, you lose that interest in it. You don't get to keep it.

John Rogers: And for public policy considerations.

John Rogers: The next time you have surgery, just ask your doctor. Hey, doctor, can I just, like…

John Rogers: Get a little bit of my tonsils in a bag.

John Rogers: Wanna show my friends.

John Rogers: That's not weird, that's normal.

John Rogers: Anyways… Questions?

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, this might be a stupid question, But… do you get….

John Rogers: Hold on, hold on, let me stop right there.

gevorg kulikyan: Yes.

gevorg kulikyan: It's a medical question, that's why.

John Rogers: The medical… hold on, hold on. Let me prepare myself to see if this is stupid, and I want everyone to pay attention if this is a stupid question. Alright.

gevorg kulikyan: Alright, so…

gevorg kulikyan: do you decide what happens to the body part? You can't keep it, you lose all possessory interest in it once it's removed, but can I decide what happens to that?

gevorg kulikyan: Body part, once it is removed.

gevorg kulikyan: Like, if they're like, I'm gonna take this.

gevorg kulikyan: organ of yours and donate it to somebody else who needs it. Can I object to that?

John Rogers: You know, that's a good question, I don't know.

gevorg kulikyan: So it wasn't a stupid.

John Rogers: I'm gonna take one of your kidneys and give it to a dying child that needs it. No! No! Let them die!

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, what I'm getting at is if you have that…

gevorg kulikyan: say in what happens to it afterwards, you still have some sort of interest.

John Rogers: I actually don't know.

John Rogers: … I don't have my driver's license, but I know I'm a donor on there.

John Rogers: So I don't know if I get to choose where my…

John Rogers: organs go exactly. I want it to go to this, but not there, and I don't know.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: I actually don't know. Sounds like a pretty good research assignment.

gevorg kulikyan: When you're a donor, it's just… it's given to the…

gevorg kulikyan: people, I know that. Whoever needs it gets it. That's what, like, for the donors list, or whatever.

gevorg kulikyan: But… Yeah, I don't know.

John Rogers: I'm not gonna say it's a stupid question at all, I don't know.

gevorg kulikyan: And it's not a stupid question.

gevorg kulikyan: The ruling in this case, it was kind of like… Your organisms, or whatever.

gevorg kulikyan: Like, your cells, you don't have an interest or say in.

John Rogers: Yeah, sure, but the… also, what happens if you're not a donor? Well, at the same time, yes, because you could be cremated.

gevorg kulikyan: I don't want to donate any of my organs.

John Rogers: I won't be able to suffer.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: … I want to be cremated. I want all my stuff burned.

John Rogers: Put into a jar. And spread.

John Rogers: wherever.

John Rogers: I'm not quite sure, because if you were to say, donate my lungs here, donate my heart here, and all of a sudden, the place that you designated for your lungs to go is out of business, what do we do? Just kind of throw your lungs away?

gevorg kulikyan: Drop it in the sewer? Like, what do we do?

John Rogers: So, I don't… Think so.

John Rogers: But like I said, sounds like a pretty good research assignment for you.

gevorg kulikyan: Gonna do it right now.

John Rogers: Okay.

gevorg kulikyan: We all standby.

John Rogers: Standing by.

Yessenia Soria: But isn't it when you, want a donuts because… or they take it, remove it, it's because something's wrong with them?

Yessenia Soria: Or because you already have a donor in mind.

John Rogers: I assume when… when you're dead.

John Rogers: Is that what we were talking about?

Yessenia Soria: Yeah, I don't know.

gevorg kulikyan: Honestly, I'm speaking hypothetically, because if you are going to have a body part removed, it's most likely something is wrong with it. But let's say, in this world, it was removed, and…

gevorg kulikyan: Someone else can use it.

John Rogers: How about we just say you're blood, your donating blood, how's that?

John Rogers: I want to know where my blood is going.

John Rogers: Everyone should donate blood.

John Rogers: Probably one of the best gifts you can give a stranger.

John Rogers: Because one day, Maybe you might need blood, and you'd sink the people that don't need it theirs.

Yessenia Soria: I have 10 pins.

Yessenia Soria: Because I've donated that much blood.

John Rogers: Anyways…

John Rogers: What I think I'd like to do here is take a break for 15 minutes, we'll come back at 8.10, and then… we start going like this.

John Rogers: Okay, so enjoy your break.

Yessenia Soria: Thank you, you too.

John Rogers: Hope everyone had a really nice break.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: …

John Rogers: if… If you've been out to lunch.

John Rogers: Now's the time to come back.

John Rogers: … We are now going into…

John Rogers: The… what students have told me

John Rogers: To be the most challenging part of the class.

John Rogers: To me, it is my favorite part of the class.

John Rogers: I love it! In fact, I get depressed when we finish it, because that's the… Farthest amount of time.

John Rogers: From when I can teach it again.

John Rogers: So I get really excited, I'm in a good mood, alright.

John Rogers: … But…

John Rogers: From a student's position, it's… you can ask anyone in the face of the earth that has taken this class before.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: They will all tell you they do not like this part.

John Rogers: They will all tell you Random comments about how much they hate this part.

John Rogers: You… we will…

John Rogers: you will see me at graduation. When you graduate, I'll be there. And you'll say, I hated present and future interests. I know, it's not sexy stuff.

John Rogers: … It's not hard.

John Rogers: I'm telling you right now, it's not hard.

John Rogers: But it's easy to lose… grasp.

John Rogers: You will, we'll finish a class, maybe next week, week after, and you will… Just think to yourself.

John Rogers: What did we just do?

John Rogers: And it's not gonna really start sinking in until about Thanksgiving for you.

John Rogers: So I typically get phone calls.

John Rogers: It's not hard.

John Rogers: You just don't overthink it.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: The problem is, is that there's going to be some… Confusion.

John Rogers: And your textbook will contradict itself.

John Rogers: One part of the text will say this.

John Rogers: The very same thing, it will say something different.

John Rogers: The cases that we will go over?

John Rogers: the, … Courts will misidentify things.

John Rogers: So even the appellate courts will… will screw it up.

John Rogers: You… if you use some type of supplemental source, your… supplemental source… We'll call something one thing.

John Rogers: the book will call it one thing, and I will say it's another thing.

John Rogers: So… when I teach this, … I, I found that…

John Rogers: After a couple years of teaching this, I just tried to kind of dumb this down as much as possible.

John Rogers: And I theorized, and I think it's still a valid theory.

John Rogers: that I want to teach this very basically to you.

John Rogers: If you understand the basics, You can figure out the more advanced Issues. Scenarios.

John Rogers: But the first few years, I just felt that a lot of students were just getting lost.

John Rogers: They were freaking out.

John Rogers: … And I don't… I just felt like it was doing them a disservice.

John Rogers: And I'm ex… I need you to know this long-term, because, hey, this'll be on your bar exam.

John Rogers: Gotta know it.

John Rogers: So, and I didn't mean to… Make anyone fearful. …

John Rogers: But I just want to stress how…

John Rogers: You need to know this, you're not…

John Rogers: Can't just check out now for the next 5 weeks and expect to do well on your final.

John Rogers: You don't know what's going on.

John Rogers: Now remember, I'm always around. If you have questions, you always call me. I do get a little bit annoyed, though, especially in the material that we're covering now. If you text me questions, I just go, no, just give me a call.

John Rogers: Okay? Because it's very hard to answer a question with a text if it's just yes or no, because then I have to type out the…

John Rogers: the rationale behind it, and it's just… I don't want to do it. It's just easier for me to say it.

John Rogers: So, if you have a supplemental source, whatever it is, wonderful.

John Rogers: I just want to be very basic.

John Rogers: And eventually, we will get into more black belt level. Okay, so let's just start with the white belt, okay?

Yessenia Soria: Professor, is there a specific time you… you answer your phone?

Yessenia Soria: Like, I don't want to call you and you're in court.

John Rogers: Shoot me a text. Say, are you ready? Are you available? I need to talk. Now, worry.

John Rogers: Give me a call in 20 minutes.

John Rogers: Just don't do this.

John Rogers: If you call me and I don't pick up, just follow up with a text, say, hey, it's me, this is who I am, let me know when you talk. Or leave a message.

John Rogers: Don't, ….

Yessenia Soria: Don't call you 5,000 times. Yes, I got.

John Rogers: Well, you can call me 5,000 all you want, but just… I mean…

John Rogers: Let me know who you are, don't just call me, and then don't…

John Rogers: I don't know your number, okay? So if I don't know your number, And if I….

Yessenia Soria: It's private, so I usually, what I do is I text, say, professor, are you available? My number's private, and then if you say yes, and then I'll.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Fine.

John Rogers: Do whatever it is, but…

John Rogers: I had a very weird guy that… that took me a few years ago, and he used to call me and just go, hey.

John Rogers: I'd be like.

John Rogers: I have a question, and I'm like.

John Rogers: You need to identify yourself, dude. Like, who are you? Who are you?

John Rogers: Anyways… Eventually, if you call me enough, I'll know who you are. But, …

John Rogers: If you don't leave a message, you don't follow up with a text, I just won't call you back. I don't know if you're a crazy person, or who knows, because my cell phone number's everywhere.

Yessenia Soria: No, I'm not crazy, trust me.

John Rogers: I believe you.

John Rogers: So as I said before, we're on our descending.

John Rogers: Going down now.

John Rogers: I'm sure you've spoken to people that have taken this class before that have said that they don't like certain sections, am I right?

Yessenia Soria: Honestly, everybody that I've asked has, property, everybody tells me it's hard.

John Rogers: I think so! I think this class is harder than evidence. So you could talk to all those peasants in evidence, and they will tell you, oh, evidence is so hard. This class is harder.

John Rogers: You can survive this class, Survive evidence.

John Rogers: 100%.

John Rogers: 100%.

John Rogers: But I also spoon-feed my evidence class, I think.

John Rogers: Any questions?

John Rogers: Okay, ladies and gentlemen, girls, I bring you the chocolate room.

John Rogers: We are learning about the transfer of assets.

John Rogers: It can be a piece of land, it could be a car, It could be a chattel?

John Rogers: It could be grandma's CVS China that she says is really expensive.

John Rogers: Okay? It doesn't matter.

John Rogers: For the purposes of lecture for the next 5 weeks.

John Rogers: I am going to relate this section to land, physical soil, earth.

John Rogers: the crust.

John Rogers: But it is applicable to Grandma's China.

John Rogers: It is applicable to the car.

John Rogers: The pig.

John Rogers: Whatever. It's just easier for me to teach as it relates to land.

John Rogers: In this universe, That we are now going into, into this new dimension of reality.

John Rogers: You have to… you have to think of

John Rogers: You have to remember that 190-year-old woman can have a child.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: I said that correctly.

John Rogers: A woman who is 190 years old, Can have a child.

John Rogers: … So we are learning, in essence, estate planning.

John Rogers: What do you want to do when you die? When you die, where do you want your house to go? I want my house to go to my beloved children, but I only want them to use it for residential purposes. I don't want them opening up a karate studio.

John Rogers: And if they open up a karate studio, I want to make sure it goes to the Red Cross.

John Rogers: And that they use it to take blood from people to donate. And if they don't do that, I want it to go to my best friend, Francis.

John Rogers: But if she gets married, I want it to go to John, unless Phil… Gets an A-plus in property.

John Rogers: I want to give it to my best friend for her life.

John Rogers: And when she dies, I want to give it to the first child of hers that gets an A- in real property class, and if none of them get an A- in property class, I want it to go to this person for life, then to their heirs in fee simple.

John Rogers: You are having now to dissect that and figure out

John Rogers: What on earth is going on?

John Rogers: And… sometimes, things are not…

John Rogers: written by lawyers. Sometimes it's written by people with a 4th grade education on a used piece of toilet paper.

John Rogers: And you have to figure it out.

John Rogers: And most of the time, they're all dead.

John Rogers: So you can't text them, I'm sorry, okay? You're gonna have to figure out, what was their intentions?

John Rogers: What do they mean by it?

John Rogers: So what we are learning is a new language.

John Rogers: Language of estate planning. Wills, trusts, estates, probate, all that.

John Rogers: And there is language that is required to establish a certain type of an estate, an interest.

John Rogers: And if there wasn't, Then there'd be no way to figure out, really, what someone intended.

John Rogers: So we're learning a new Language.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: If I want to give you something, Let me go back.

John Rogers: I'm a very big proponent of iPhone law. Law that existed during the iPhone days.

John Rogers: Okay, so if there was an iPhone, I like that kind of law.

John Rogers: Unfortunately, This law that we are learning goes back hundreds of years.

John Rogers: And unfortunately, we have to learn both iPhone law and hundreds and hundreds of years pre-iPhone.

John Rogers: So that's common law.

John Rogers: and modern law. And you will need to know Both.

John Rogers: Multiple choice questions in this area is common law. So if you're on the bar exam, it's always going to be common law.

John Rogers: Essays, on the other hand, Unless it's stated, generally, modern principles apply.

John Rogers: So… Anytime.

John Rogers: Someone, or some people, or an entity.

John Rogers: is giving someone… if someone is getting interest, a piece of property, Okay?

John Rogers: Ask yourselves.

John Rogers: Are they getting this?

John Rogers: in fee?

John Rogers: or a life.

John Rogers: Do they get this for the rest of their life, till they live, and then once they die, it goes to someone else? Or…

John Rogers: Do they have it forever, and it follows their estate when they die?

John Rogers: I'm gonna get ya. I'm gonna get ya on this, okay?

John Rogers: So… If I want to, convey property to someone, and I want to give you the maximum ownership

John Rogers: Okay? I want to give you a piece of land.

John Rogers: I might share my screen just so that I can start typing.

John Rogers: My computer's running a little slow.

John Rogers: So, let's begin with the fees.

John Rogers: The F-E-E.

John Rogers: I am giving you something. I'm selling you something.

John Rogers: Doesn't matter.

John Rogers: And I'm giving it or selling it to you in.

John Rogers: B.

John Rogers: there's… Three types.

John Rogers: Let's begin with the first one.

John Rogers: It's called a fee.

John Rogers: Simple.

John Rogers: Absolute FSA.

John Rogers: I own a piece of property, it's mine, yay, it's called Blackacre, okay?

John Rogers: And I want to give it to you, and I want to make sure that you have 100% ownership interest in it. That you can do whatever you want, you can…

John Rogers: Do whatever you want on the land, and when you die.

John Rogers: It goes with your estate, so you can put it in your will to designate it to someone.

John Rogers: Or if you die, it will go to your heirs.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: The difference, though, is if I give you something for life.

John Rogers: you can't put it in your will, because it only lasts for the duration of your life. So the last remaining breath

John Rogers: that you take.

John Rogers: That's when the property's gone.

John Rogers: So we're talking about fees, and fees potentially go for life, for forever and ever and ever.

John Rogers: It's like me, I'm selling you my Malibu mansion. Who would want to live there anyways? But I'm selling you a Malibu mansion.

John Rogers: You get it in the simple absolute.

John Rogers: Okay, can everybody see my screen?

Aram Harutyunyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: Okay. The fees, simple, absolute. Oops.

John Rogers: Okay? Now… If I wanted to convey property to you.

John Rogers: So you get it with 100% ownership, like, I'm selling you my property.

John Rogers: And you want to get it forever and ever and ever. You're buying it, whatever.

John Rogers: In order to give you the maximum amount of ownership, me transferring this property in fee simple absolute to you, I have to use certain verbiage. Now, the common law requires common law

John Rogers: Oops, let me see this. Does it say common law?

John Rogers: requires O… 2A, and… His. Her. Heirs.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, in order for me, under the common law, to transfer the largest possible interest to you.

John Rogers: It has to use the words and his or her air heirs.

John Rogers: If it does not include this, It's not a phi-simple absolute.

John Rogers: We'll get to that.

John Rogers: It's got to be heirs. The reason it must include heirs is to ensure what my intentions were. I'm giving it to you so that when you die, your heirs get this.

John Rogers: That evidence is it's going to you. You have an interest, a possessory interest.

John Rogers: And when you die, it goes to your heirs, or whomever you wish to designate.

John Rogers: Someone's got their hand raised.

Dove night: So, so if they don't… so if it don't have… and his or her heirs, it's not the me… it's not a simple absolute?

John Rogers: That's correct.

John Rogers: I'll get to that in a second.

John Rogers: …

John Rogers: Now, this chapter which we're going into is going to be present interest. What does someone have right now?

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: So O will be owner. I own this. O. And I always say A. This is the very basics. O conveys 2A, so O is presently giving A something right now.

John Rogers: I am giving you something. I'm conveying something, Blackacre, to you.

John Rogers: If… Under the common law, it says, oh… 2A… then that…

John Rogers: does not equal a fee simple absolute, because it doesn't have the word heirs.

John Rogers: So, under the common law, A would have a present possessory interest in a life estate, which means, which we'll get into.

John Rogers: that A's interest will only last for the duration of A's life.

John Rogers: A can't put the property in A's will.

John Rogers: Because A doesn't have the power to designate it to anyone once A dies.

John Rogers: It's not FOREVER.

John Rogers: So this would be a life estate.

John Rogers: modernly.

John Rogers: O conveys Blackacre 2A, Modernly, it's different.

John Rogers: It doesn't require the word errors.

John Rogers: because it's presumed that just 2A

John Rogers: that O is transferring the largest possible estate. A fee. Fee simple absolute. So, A would have a fee simple absolute. A has it, A can do whatever A wants with it, A can sell it, A can put in his or her will, doesn't matter.

John Rogers: So notice here, modernly, O to A is a fee-simple absolute.

John Rogers: But under the common law, it's a life estate.

John Rogers: Careful with that, okay?

John Rogers: Modernly, To create a life estate

John Rogers: Modernly, it must have the words OTA for life.

John Rogers: It must have the verbiage for life, or for her life.

John Rogers: Has to have 4 life in there.

John Rogers: We're gonna learn about the different types, but for right now, it has to say life.

John Rogers: You mean that A has a life estate?

John Rogers: A has a present interest in a life estate that will last for the duration.

John Rogers: of A's life.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: This will be formally written out, like, you know, Olivia owns Black Acre and Fee Simple.

John Rogers: Absolute.

John Rogers: Ugh.

John Rogers: Olivia conveyed Black Acre… to… her… Oh… Olivia…

John Rogers: Delivered a valid deed to her best friend

John Rogers: … Ashley.

John Rogers: stating, to Ashley, Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.

John Rogers: That's how it's formally written out, that's usually how it's written out on a final exam, or a bar exam.

John Rogers: O? O stands… O stands for the owner of the property, okay? So, it's usually… I always, always, always make O the owner of the property.

John Rogers: So it's, like, Oscar, or Olive, Olivia, it's just the person that is initially conveying the property. And think of O as the architect.

John Rogers: O is the person that is deciding where the property is going, who it's going to, for how long. They are the architect.

John Rogers: Got it?

John Rogers: … So… O2A.

John Rogers: conveys a fee.

John Rogers: fee, simple, absolute. If it's just…

John Rogers: If it ends there, it's a feasible absolute. It's the largest

John Rogers: Maximum possi- maximum, estate possible.

John Rogers: Okay? It's a fee, simple, absolute.

John Rogers: If it doesn't… I got 2 people with their hand raised.

John Rogers: Who would like to go first?

Mireya Gonzalez: I could go first. I don't know if I'm jumping ahead a little bit, but when would you know when to use the common law versus the modern Liuan?

John Rogers: Oh, perfect question. One, the interrogatory will tell you

John Rogers: Generally, this is a common law jurisdiction, or this jurisdiction follows common law principles.

John Rogers: Sometimes you don't know based on the fact pattern, because it could be very, objective, like, you have no idea what time period this is taking place in. Sometimes you have to actually discuss both.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Sometimes you have to discuss both.

John Rogers: But my, …

John Rogers: what I always tell everyone is, if you can kind of make out that someone perhaps has an iPhone.

John Rogers: Use co- use modern principles.

Mireya Gonzalez: Thank you.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: So, once A gets it in the simple absolute.

John Rogers: A can do whatever they want with it.

John Rogers: If A dies, it goes to A's heirs, or whomever A designates to inherit whoever they want, their best friend, their kids.

John Rogers: Whoever!

John Rogers: But if it's a life estate, no.

John Rogers: It's only… A only has it for A's life.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: Questions on fee, simple, absolute.

John Rogers: You will look back at this and say, this is easy.

John Rogers: ….

Yessenia Soria: Professor, I have a question. Yeah. So…

Yessenia Soria: Let's say the caller question says, Yesenia is leaving… Her home to her sister.

Yessenia Soria: Then if the sister dies, the sister's to leave it to her daughters. It has to have common law, the O to the A, and his, hers, hires.

Yessenia Soria: There's, well, it just says, I'm leaving it to my daughter.

John Rogers: Is that what it is? Okay, leave it to the daughter.

John Rogers: And then… When the daughter dies, what happens?

Yessenia Soria: She'll leave it to her sister.

John Rogers: She leaves it to whose sister?

Yessenia Soria: The daughter-sister.

John Rogers: daughter.

Yessenia Soria: So let's say I… I… I…

Yessenia Soria: I'm using the common law. I die, and I leave my house to my sister. So when my sister dies, she's gonna leave it to her daughter.

John Rogers: So, wait….

Yessenia Soria: It has to have that wording, though, right?

John Rogers: Go on.

John Rogers: It should say that, yes.

John Rogers: Otherwise, it would just be….

Yessenia Soria: The life of my sister.

John Rogers: Or just… sure. Or just… yeah, you could say O to A for life, then to B.

John Rogers: We'll get to that. This is just very bare basics.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: So, like, the sister, the third person involved, like, B, those are future interests. We'll get all into that all later. Right now, it's just, what does A have?

John Rogers: Present possessory interest holder. A's got what? What does A have?

John Rogers: … Any other questions?

John Rogers: I forgot what my notes say. I don't know if I go into Fetale or life estate, would….

Yessenia Soria: Detail.

John Rogers: Feeting, okay. So remember, there's 3 types of fees, okay?

John Rogers: So we're done with this. Yahoo!

John Rogers: Now we're going into fee tail. Not a big fan of the fetails.

John Rogers: The fee tail… Is a common law only, and maybe about 4 states?

John Rogers: Still follow the fee tail.

Dove night: You said this is common, just common law?

John Rogers: And about minority only. This doesn't exist modernly.

John Rogers: A modern majority. Modern majority does not exist.

John Rogers: Only applicable under common law or far-reaching minorities.

John Rogers: And it's written in a way to

John Rogers: Keep land to someone's lineal descendants.

John Rogers: Think blood.

John Rogers: DNA.

John Rogers: So, O conveys Blackacre to A and the heirs of her body.

John Rogers: So think of it like I'm keeping it within the blood.

John Rogers: This is only applicable under common law and minority.

John Rogers: Modernally, this verbiage would create a fee-simple absolute, because the fetal has been abolished.

John Rogers: common law, and minority, equals… Detailed.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: If… That happens.

John Rogers: And it's a common law, just for note-taking purposes, we'll cover this later, but O will retain a reversion. O retains a reversion, it's a future interest. This should all be in my notes, by the way. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if these examples are directly from my notes.

John Rogers: Because they've been tattooed into my brain over the years.

John Rogers: … But O then retains reversion, because if I give you property, Okay?

John Rogers: in detail.

John Rogers: It can only go after you to your lineal descendants, your DNA.

John Rogers: But what happens if you made the right life call and never had kids?

John Rogers: He's not going anywhere!

John Rogers: There's no lineal descendants, there's no further DNA!

John Rogers: So what happens?

John Rogers: it's going to go back to O, Or… O's heirs.

John Rogers: The property, Black Acre, can never just be floating around.

John Rogers: Oh, we don't really know!

John Rogers: It's always going to go somewhere.

John Rogers: Immediately. So never just say.

John Rogers: I mean, I don't really know, it's, you know, it's probably just floating around somewhere, I don't know.

John Rogers: It will always go somewhere.

John Rogers: So, if A dies with no lineal descendants, she has no kids, thank God!

John Rogers: … it will go back to Oak.

John Rogers: Because remember, the architect, which was O, specifically said 2A,

John Rogers: And the airs of her body, if she doesn't have…

John Rogers: Heirs of her body, meaning… kids… DNA… Then it's not going anywhere.

John Rogers: It's gonna go back.

John Rogers: It's not a fee-simple absolute, it's limited.

John Rogers: to Bloodline.

John Rogers: Question.

Dove night: So, feet tail is just for bloodline, it's… And, descendants, that's it.

John Rogers: Yes, correct.

Mireya Gonzalez: I have a question, Professor. If the… if it goes back to the owner, and the owner doesn't have any errors, what happens then, and the owner is not…

Mireya Gonzalez: Living.

Mireya Gonzalez: Oh, yeah.

John Rogers: -Oh. … It will always go somewhere.

John Rogers: Remember that. And, when I mean somewhere, I mean the state will come in and take it somewhere. Okay?

John Rogers: But when you get to the awful class of wills, trusts, and estates, you'd be very surprised about how you calculate your heirs.

John Rogers: It actually goes down, and then back around up.

John Rogers: and then a different tree line. It's really… complicated.

John Rogers: But they'll find a home.

John Rogers: Black Acre will be somewhere, don't worry about that.

Mireya Gonzalez: So essentially, if it… if that… if the… if O doesn't have errors, then it gets… it goes to the state.

John Rogers: Potentially.

Mireya Gonzalez: Or whoever O designates. Okay.

John Rogers: It will go somewhere, trust me.

John Rogers: Questions about fee-tail?

John Rogers: Fee tail. These types of fees.

John Rogers: Remember, common law, minority only, okay? So that's green and red.

John Rogers: Modern majority, modernly, or I should say say modern majority. There we go. Modern majority.

John Rogers: It means a fee-simple absolute.

John Rogers: I don't know if in my notes I included language about disentailing a fee tail, It's okay.

John Rogers: Now.

John Rogers: what I have tattooed in my memory.

John Rogers: Is a life estate now.

John Rogers: Because I can learn or teach you about defeasible fees now.

John Rogers: but I typically teach it Later.

John Rogers: So what does my notes say? Because I usually want to go in that order.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Life estate.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Isn't like….

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So… What we are doing now.

John Rogers: is putting this on hold, okay?

John Rogers: We're putting this on hold, so we're setting the brakes up.

John Rogers: And we were getting back to it.

John Rogers: Trust me.

John Rogers: We are getting back to it. Trust me.

John Rogers: But… when I go over life estates, there's… Defeasible life estates.

John Rogers: And they work similarly to defusible fees.

John Rogers: So once I cover that, it will make the discussion for defeasible fees very short.

John Rogers: So we're gonna put that on hold, and we're gonna go under now lightness statements, okay? Now remember, it's all about, I am conveying property to someone. I'm O, and I'm conveying it to someone. What does this person have?

John Rogers: Though it is.

John Rogers: Just learning, what does this person have?

John Rogers: Right now.

John Rogers: Now… Similar to 3 types of fees, There are 3 types of Life Estates!

John Rogers: There is life of the grantee.

John Rogers: there is, Paratra V. I forget how to… spell it.

John Rogers: E? I don't know if there's an E here. Did I spell that right?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: It's A U T R E.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: V-I-E.

John Rogers: A U… what?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: AU?

John Rogers: Where's the… okay, AU. Okay, okay.

John Rogers: That?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yep, and then VIP.

John Rogers: Paratra V, okay? Which means life of another.

John Rogers: And then there are death fees… oh, sorry.

John Rogers: The feasible life estates.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: There's 3 types of defusible life estates.

John Rogers: There's a life estate.

John Rogers: Subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: Life Estate.

John Rogers: I can say determinable life estate.

John Rogers: And then there's, … Life, estate, subject to executory… oops.

John Rogers: Limitations.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, for tonight.

John Rogers: We're probably just going to cover these two, and then we will resume next week going into these.

John Rogers: Okay, so for right now, we're going to talk about life of the grantee.

John Rogers: Very simple, very commonly tested, it's just…

John Rogers: Life of the grantee. So when you think of it, who's the grantee? I'm the grantor, I'm O, I'm conveying it to A. A is the grantee.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: I'm getting it!

John Rogers: But you're getting it, right? A, you are A. You're the grantee, I'm the grantor. I'm O, you are A.

John Rogers: So… O… 2A for life!

John Rogers: life of the grantee, so you will have this estate until you use property, Blackacre, until you die.

John Rogers: You will not… your estate, Will not have it longer.

John Rogers: So the moment you die, It's gone.

John Rogers: You don't put it in a will, because you have no interest, you have no power after you die.

John Rogers: Now, you all might be thinking something.

John Rogers: This is how a lot of murder cases happen.

John Rogers: Hey, you've got kids and family members that have things until they die, and hey, maybe, oh, sweet grandma was, you know, had a heart attack!

John Rogers: You actually put a pillow over her face and killed her.

John Rogers: Check.

John Rogers: This is life of the grantee, because A is the grantee, the recipient, and this Blackacre is 4A's Life.

John Rogers: If it's common law, it's just O to A!

John Rogers: Remember common law up here?

John Rogers: Right up here? Oh yeah, that. Forgot about that.

John Rogers: There's no requirement of… for life.

John Rogers: So, A has a present possessory interest, because it's going to A. That present possessory interest will last for the duration of A's life.

John Rogers: As evidenced by 4.

John Rogers: life.

John Rogers: Very common.

John Rogers: Life of another.

John Rogers: Per attribute.

John Rogers: Now… I'm O, and you are A.

John Rogers: Should I slow down?

John Rogers: You are a IMO.

John Rogers: I am conveying Black Acre to UA.

John Rogers: But I'm not conveying it for your life.

John Rogers: I'm conveying it to you for the duration of someone else's life.

John Rogers: So, I give you a Blackacre, For the life… of B.

John Rogers: So, it's not for A's life.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: It's for… B's life.

John Rogers: So, A will have this land.

John Rogers: Until B takes his or her last breath.

John Rogers: So, A has every incentive.

John Rogers: to keep bee alive, so you know there's no motive to murder there.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: Because once B dies.

John Rogers: A loses the property, even if A's alive, the moment B dies, A no longer has it. It's gone.

John Rogers: Back to… oh!

John Rogers: Well, we'll have a reversion. We'll get into it. It's a future interest.

John Rogers: But in this situation, O will get it.

John Rogers: Once B dies.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Would that also be the case if A dies?

John Rogers: That's a good question.

John Rogers: … I've never really gone that deep in the material.

John Rogers: And the sources that you will read in the book Run contrary with each other.

John Rogers: My position under modern law?

John Rogers: would be that it would go to A's Heirs, Until B dies.

John Rogers: I believe back in the bar review bar exam days, they told me that it would go back to O.

John Rogers: once A dies, because the… Purpose of O was for A only.

John Rogers: But I've never gone further than that. And if I do, I'll let you know.

John Rogers: But, I love the question.

John Rogers: So, it's for the life of someone else.

John Rogers: So you have this land right now. It's yours. It's yours.

John Rogers: You can have as many water balloon flight fights as you want.

John Rogers: your property.

John Rogers: Until… B dots.

John Rogers: Make sense?

John Rogers: I feel like I'm going a little bit too fast, and it's making me a little nervous, so, …

John Rogers: Questions?

John Rogers: Because this is very basic, and it's gonna start compounding.

John Rogers: But it's very important to understand this first, because it's… it's, again, it's gonna be a snowball, so it's just gonna get bigger and bigger and bigger.

John Rogers: Hand raised.

Avi Omrany: This is a dumb question, but can you sell… oh, sorry, I know you don't like that. Can you sell your life estate?

John Rogers: Sure!

Avi Omrany: And….

John Rogers: If you do sell your life estate, it's still based off of your life, though, correct? It's not based off of the other person's life. Hey, so hey, let's go even further, then. So, life of the grantee?

John Rogers: So, that's what you're talking about. This is where things get a little gray, a little… I hope I don't lose too many people. But let's supposing this happens, okay?

John Rogers: O conveys Blackacre, 2A for life, okay? Yahoo, you're A.

John Rogers: But you say, you know, I don't really like living in Malibu, this Malibu mansion's okay, it's just so far from everything, and, you know, I'm still relatively young, and I still like to go to Santa Monica and party, yahoo, so I really want to, you know, sell it.

John Rogers: And I want to move to… Where are we going?

Avi Omrany: Hancock Park.

John Rogers: Hancock Park.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, you sell the property to B. Now, remember.

John Rogers: O gave specific directions O to A for life.

John Rogers: There's no reference about anyone else.

John Rogers: So… You?

John Rogers: as A, sell the Malibu mansion to B. A sells to B.

John Rogers: B is not anywhere in here, which is fine.

John Rogers: So… A, B's interest.

John Rogers: Is under the umbrella.

John Rogers: of A.

John Rogers: B could NEVER.

John Rogers: sell, convey, or possess Blackacre.

John Rogers: longer than.

John Rogers: A's life.

John Rogers: So, be.

John Rogers: Has what?

Avi Omrany: Life has stayed by proxy.

John Rogers: By what?

Avi Omrany: Proxy?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Per All Trivy.

John Rogers: There we go, per Atre V. Yes, correct, both of you, melting my heart. Yes?

John Rogers: Because B will have the Malibu Mansion.

John Rogers: Until A dies.

John Rogers: cannot have this property longer than A's life.

John Rogers: O gave very specific directions, only for the life of A.

John Rogers: It will NEVER exceed A's life.

John Rogers: Question.

Dove night: So… I'll give A for gave the property to A for life, so A sells to B.

Dove night: So, because O gave it for life, so B can keep that property for his or her life.

John Rogers: for the life of A.

Dove night: For the life of A. So, if A dies, then B lose the property.

John Rogers: Yes.

Dove night: Thank you.

John Rogers: Just remember, you're able to convey

John Rogers: Something equal or less than what you have.

John Rogers: You can never convey something more.

John Rogers: So, A, in this situation right here, cannot sell to B in B simple absolute.

John Rogers: It can only be for the duration of A's life, maximum.

John Rogers: O did not authorize that.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

John Rogers: Again, I feel like I'm going kind of fast. I don't remember going this fast.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, I'm lost.

John Rogers: Okay.

Yessenia Soria: So, O to A for life, A cells to B.

Yessenia Soria: But B is…

Yessenia Soria: Interest is under the umbrella of A. Correct. So, if A sells to B, wouldn't it be B?

Yessenia Soria: B's property, if they sold it to them?

John Rogers: O is the architect, and O decides.

John Rogers: I'm giving it to A for A's life.

John Rogers: Hey, you could do whatever you want with it.

John Rogers: You could sell it, do whatever you want, but…

John Rogers: You can't sell it to someone who will retain possession Longer than you live.

John Rogers: So, when you die, A, Anyone that has this property that you sold to is gonna lose it too.

John Rogers: It's never going to be more than your life.

Yessenia Soria: So, is there people that actually buy stuff like that?

John Rogers: Sure, but there's also fraudsters, too.

John Rogers: And guess what?

John Rogers: Let me ask you this.

John Rogers: If O conveys a life estate to A,

John Rogers: Okay? O to A for life.

John Rogers: and then A tells B, I'm conveying this to you, B.

John Rogers: In phi simple absolute.

John Rogers: It's misrepresentation, right?

John Rogers: what happens if A dies?

John Rogers: Where's the property supposed to go?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Back to O.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: But O is on the prop… but B is on the property.

John Rogers: So what does that make B?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Adverse possessor.

John Rogers: Correct! Heart is melting!

John Rogers: B would then become an adverse possessor.

Dove night: So you're saying that if O sells to A for life, and then A dies, and B… I mean… I mean, B… O sells to A for life, and then A sells to B, and then A dies, and B's on the property, he's an adverse possessor?

John Rogers: Well, wait, wait, wait.

John Rogers: Wait a second.

John Rogers: Why couldn't be a she?

Dove night: be he or she.

John Rogers: I mean… I mean, I'm offended.

John Rogers: I mean…

John Rogers: Let's have some gender equality.

Dove night: Okay.

John Rogers: I had a class in 2016 with all female students, and it was always she.

John Rogers: Ever since then, I always say, he or she. Anyways, sorry to interrupt. Go ahead.

Dove night: Oh, okay. So…

Dove night: B is on the property for… I mean, because Elsa got it for life, and he gave it to B… I mean, he gave it to her.

Dove night: And she's on a property. I mean, Bea's on the property.

Dove night: And when A dives, B is an adverse possessor.

John Rogers: You lost me. Say it again?

Dove night: The life estate from A, A has the life estate from O.

Dove night: and A sells the property to B.

Dove night: and A dies, and B is on that property, he's an adverse possessor.

John Rogers: That's correct.

John Rogers: if A is… If B is on that property, without the consent of O, or even knowledge, who knows?

John Rogers: B would be an adverse possessor.

Amir Akbari: It would be a constructive position under the color of the… Title, right?

John Rogers: Potentially, yeah. Defective deed of some sort?

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: Yeah, yeah, there you go. Now you're interlinking things together. Melting my heart. Melting. Absolutely in love with you.

John Rogers: Paul.

John Rogers: By the way, I told this to my evidence class, and I need to tell it to you, to this class. I heard that one of my colleagues, who has been teaching here for, like, 40 years.

John Rogers: says biatch in his lecture.

John Rogers: I have earned the right to do the same.

John Rogers: So, I will be throwing it in there. And he says, TF.

John Rogers: So… I've earned that as well.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

Yessenia Soria: I think I got it, but maybe next week we have to go over it again, because I'll probably forget, or I'll be calling you.

John Rogers: Could at least someone just send me a private message and say, if you're…

John Rogers: having a difficult time right now. I won't call you out, I just want to know.

John Rogers: Because I just can't tell if you're being quiet, if you don't want to say something or not, I just want to know where everyone's at.

John Rogers: just let me know, because I don't want to have to keep going and going and going, and then you get…

John Rogers: Falling further behind.

Karen Hernandez: I agree with Jessenia, it's, like, marinating. I'm starting to think, but I think I'm gonna have to review it next class, too.

John Rogers: absolutely should be reviewing it like crazy, okay? This is… what we're learning tonight is just the bare basics. It's gonna start compounding. It's gonna start getting harder and harder and harder.

John Rogers: And you'll get through it, I promise you, just make sure you keep up with the material, okay? You just can…

John Rogers: Keep up with it, because I can only go so far teaching you.

John Rogers: I can only go so far, okay?

John Rogers: I…

John Rogers: give you all the final exams. I will pretty soon, if I haven't already, give you final exam answers. I'm available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. You can call me, email me, I spoon-feed you, I give you a class outline, I give you everything you need.

John Rogers: I… can only go so far. You have to do the work yourself.

Yessenia Soria: Professor, so the interest examples that we have on the outline, it has to do with what we're learning right now, right?

John Rogers: Interesting example.

Yessenia Soria: The O to A, if A receives an A-plus in real property… oh, no, never mind. Something else.

John Rogers: If you can get all those, you've got a black belt. I'll give you a black belt.

John Rogers: Okay?

Yessenia Soria: Okay.

Mireya Gonzalez: Professor, I do have a question.

Mireya Gonzalez: So, as far as the states.

Mireya Gonzalez: Three type of estates, and you can obtain those estates with 3…

Mireya Gonzalez: With… with either of the three fee.

Mireya Gonzalez: with either of the three fees, which is, like, the FSA that you said, the veto, and then the feasible fee. So you could obtain those different estates using those three, so to say, purchases or transfers.

John Rogers: Say that one more time.

Mireya Gonzalez: So, like, in my head, I'm thinking of it kind of like a tree. So, the top is the estates. You could obtain those estates with the three fees that… the three different types of fees that you set.

John Rogers: Kind of. It's, … It's, I'm giving you something.

John Rogers: And I'm either gonna be giving you something in life or feet.

John Rogers: And there's 3 types.

John Rogers: what is it? Because I might be giving you something of life, And then when you die.

John Rogers: It goes to someone in fee.

John Rogers: So, just right now, I sent you a diagram.

John Rogers: Looks like a big tic-tac-toe.

John Rogers: We're just learning about the middle column, present interest. O is conveying something. What is O conveying?

John Rogers: What does A have?

John Rogers: I don't know if that answers your question, though.

Mireya Gonzalez: No, it didn't. I think I just worded it.

Mireya Gonzalez: Bodily.

John Rogers: …

John Rogers: Well, at least someone.

John Rogers: Told me that this is difficult.

John Rogers: … But, is there any other questions?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: So, this example you have on your notes.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Says common law, O conveys Blackacre to A, then to B, and her heirs.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: So, O conveying to A, That's just, … life estate.

John Rogers: You said her. You said… oh, no, A, okay, sorry, so, sorry, my apologies, go ahead.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: So, 8….

John Rogers: Yeah, okay.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I mean, O conveys to A, then to B and her heirs. That's what it says in the notes. So, O conveying to A, since it's under common law, that's just, a life estate.

John Rogers: Present possessory interests in a life estate, life of the grantor.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: once A has died, I'll go to B, and then it'll be a fee simple absolute.

John Rogers: Correct?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Okay.

John Rogers: So, does B… have motive to murder A.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yes.

John Rogers: Yes, there you go, you got it! You got it! You got it!

John Rogers: That is correct.

John Rogers: B has a, …

John Rogers: Interest to murder, so B has a fee simple absolute, A would have a present possessory interest.

John Rogers: In a life estate.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: Okay. Well, I think I'm under the policy.

John Rogers: School policy, I'm supposed to let you out now.

John Rogers: What I'm gonna do is, you are all parole for the week.

John Rogers: Have a wonderful weekend.

John Rogers: I don't know if you're going to Kala or not, but if you do, stay safe.

John Rogers: around if you have questions. I'll stick around if you guys have any questions after class. Otherwise, you're free to go about your life.

Yessenia Soria: Thank you, Professor. Have a good night.

Agnes Gholoonian: That's right.

Dove night: Yeah.
