# Negligence: Duty of Care and Economic Loss

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
**The Physical Impact Rule for Economic Loss**
In the absence of physical impact to the plaintiff's person or property, there is generally **no duty of care** owed for **pure economic loss**.
* **Requirement:** To recover for economic damages in negligence, the plaintiff must show a physical impact occurred.

### 2. Hypotheticals & Examples
* **The Traffic Jam Hypo:** A defendant rear-ends a driver, causing a massive traffic jam on the freeway.
    * *Scenario:* A florist two miles back is stuck in traffic. The flowers wilt ($10k loss), and the florist is docked pay for being late.
    * *Outcome:* The florist cannot recover from the defendant. The florist suffered **pure economic loss** without **physical impact** to their person or vehicle. The defendant owes no duty to the florist [cite: 131-152].
    * *Contrast:* The driver actually hit by the defendant *can* recover economic damages because they sustained physical impact.

# Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED): Direct Victim

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
**The Physical Manifestation Test**
To recover for NIED (pure emotional distress) in a negligence action, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant owed them a duty of care. Under modern law (post-*Daley*), the "Physical Impact Rule" is replaced by the **Physical Manifestation Test**.
* **The Rule:** A definite and objective physical manifestation of severe emotional distress is necessary to establish a duty.
* **Examples of Manifestations:** Hives, rash, stroke, fainting, or other objective physical symptoms.

### 2. Key Cases
**_Daley v. LaCroix_ (referred to as "Daily")**
* **Facts:** Defendant drove negligently; the car flew through the air, sheared a utility pole, and caused an electrical surge that damaged the plaintiff's property. The plaintiff alleged emotional distress but suffered no direct physical impact from the car or pole [cite: 43-47].
* **Holding:** The court rejected the old "Physical Impact Rule" (which required contact) and adopted the **Physical Manifestation Test**. A plaintiff can recover for pure emotional distress if they can show a definite and objective physical injury resulting from the fright.

### 3. Nuance & Policy
* **Historical Context (Physical Impact Rule):** Previously, courts required physical contact (e.g., a rotting finger in tobacco touching the lip) to recover for distress. This was a liability-limiting tool to prevent fraudulent claims and "floodgates of litigation" [cite: 82-96].
* **Placement in Analysis:** NIED is not a separate tort; it is a **Negligence** cause of action. The Physical Manifestation Test is analyzed under the **Duty** element.

# Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress (NIED): Bystander Recovery

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
**_Thing v. La Chusa_ Guidelines**
To establish that a defendant owes a **duty of care** to a bystander for NIED, the plaintiff must satisfy three specific requirements:
1.  **Close Familial Relationship:** The plaintiff must be closely related to the injury victim.
2.  **Contemporaneous Observance:** The plaintiff must be **present at the scene** of the event and **aware** that it is causing injury to the victim.
3.  **Serious Emotional Distress:** The plaintiff must suffer distress **beyond that of a disinterested witness** and which is **not abnormal**.

### 2. Key Cases
**_Thing v. La Chusa_ (referred to as "Thing")**
* **Holding:** Established the bright-line rules (above) for bystander recovery to limit liability.

### 3. Nuance & Policy
* **Distinction from Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED):**
    * *Bystander IIED* requires proving the defendant had **Intent** (Specific or General) to cause severe distress to the bystander. This requires showing the defendant **knew** the bystander was present and **knew** of the close relationship.
    * *Bystander NIED* is used when intent cannot be proven (e.g., a negligent car accident or a random attack where the defendant didn't know the victim's spouse was watching).
* **"Disinterested Witness" Standard:** Almost anyone witnessing a horrific injury suffers distress. To recover, the distress must be distinguishable from what a stranger would feel; hence the requirement for a close relationship and "serious" distress [cite: 866-876].

# Proximate Cause: Intervening and Superseding Acts

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
**Indirect Cause Analysis**
In indirect cause cases (where an intervening act occurs between the defendant's negligence and the plaintiff's injury), liability turns on whether the intervening act is **superseding** [cite: 1188-1190].

* **Superseding Act:** An act that is **extraordinary, unforeseeable, and independent**. It cuts off the defendant's liability.
* **Non-Superseding Act:** An act that flows naturally from the underlying negligence. The defendant remains liable.

### 2. Specific Intervening Acts & Foreseeability
* **Negligent Intervening Acts:** Generally **foreseeable** and **not superseding**.
    * *Example:* A hotel failing to clean up broken glass is a negligent omission, but it flows naturally from the act of breaking the glass. It does not cut off liability.
    * *Example:* Medical malpractice usually does not cut off liability for the original tortfeasor.
* **Rescuers:** Rescuers are **foreseeable plaintiffs** ("Danger invites rescue"). A rescuer's negligence (e.g., moving a victim and aggravating an injury) is generally **not superseding**.
* **Plaintiff's Own Negligence:** A plaintiff failing to take precautions (e.g., not wearing shoes near broken glass) is a foreseeable intervening act and is **not superseding** [cite: 1258-1262].
* **Criminal/Intentional Acts:** These act types are generally **least foreseeable** and more likely to be deemed superseding, unlike mere negligence.

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples
* **The Beer Bottle Hypo (Exam Review):**
    * *Facts:* Jack (D) drops a beer bottle. Hotel (Intervening) fails to clean it up. Sue (Intervening) steps on it while not wearing shoes. Cindy (Rescuer/Plaintiff) attempts to help Sue and gets injured/aggravates injury.
    * *Analysis:*
        * **Duty:** Jack owes Cindy a duty because she is a rescuer, and rescuers are foreseeable plaintiffs.
        * **Proximate Cause:**
            * Hotel's failure to clean = Negligent, but not superseding.
            * Sue not wearing shoes = Negligent (breach of implied standard/sign), but foreseeable/not superseding.
            * Cindy moving the victim = Foreseeable rescuer conduct/not superseding.
    * *Conclusion:* Jack remains liable; the intervening acts do not break the chain of causation.

# Duty to Rescue

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
**General No-Duty Rule**
Generally, there is **no duty to rescue** a person in peril.

**Exceptions**
* **Control of Instrumentality:** If a defendant controls the means of rescue or the instrumentality causing harm (e.g., a store manager stopping an escalator trapping a child), a duty to rescue arises.
* **Creation of Peril:** If the defendant created the peril (even innocently), they have a duty to assist.

### 2. Nuance & Policy
* **First Responders:** An off-duty first responder generally has no affirmative duty to rescue a stranger unless a specific relationship or statute applies.
    * *Right to Sue:* First responders *can* sue a defendant who negligently causes the peril that injures them (e.g., a firefighter suing an arsonist), though specific immunity statutes often protect responders *from* being sued.
