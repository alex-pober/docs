title: "Session 13 - Parol Evidence Rule"
description: "Comprehensive outline notes on the Parol Evidence Rule covering integration, admissibility exceptions, and major cases"
---
## I. Overview and Core Principles

### A. Definition of Parol Evidence
- **Parol evidence** = any evidence contemporaneous to or prior to the written agreement
- Can be oral or written extrinsic evidence
- Rule determines what evidence is admissible to supplement or contradict written contracts

### B. The Basic Rule
**Parol evidence is generally inadmissible to:**
- Contradict
- Vary
- Add to
- Subtract from

...the terms of an **integrated agreement**

### C. Types of Integration

#### 1. Complete (Total) Integration
- Final AND complete expression of the parties' agreement
- **No extrinsic evidence** admitted to contradict OR supplement
- Merger clauses create presumption of complete integration
- All terms intended to be included are in the writing

#### 2. Partial Integration
- Final expression but NOT complete
- Extrinsic evidence admissible to **supplement** (if consistent)
- **Cannot contradict** any terms in the writing
- Parties intended document as final but not exhaustive

### D. Intent of the Parties - Critical Principle
- Always analyze the **intent of the parties**
- Courts enforce what parties intended, not mechanical rules
- Key question: Did parties intend this document to be fully/partially integrated?
- **Exam tip**: Never go wrong mentioning "intent of the parties" in analysis

### E. The Natural Omission Test
- Would reasonable, competent parties naturally have included this term in the writing?
- If yes, and it's omitted → suggests it wasn't part of the deal OR partial integration
- If term would naturally be included but isn't mentioned → may indicate it wasn't agreed upon

## II. Major Cases

### A. Mitchell v. Lath (1923) - Traditional/Rigid Approach

#### Facts
- Charles Lath agreed to sell farm to Catherine Mitchell (1923)
- Lath owned ice house across the road (Mitchell didn't like it)
- **Written agreement**: Sale of farm
- **Separate oral agreement**: Lath would remove ice house
- After purchase, Lath refused to remove ice house
- Mitchell sued

#### Issue
Whether a separate spoken agreement can be used in court if different from the final written agreement

#### Holding
Oral agreement about ice house **NOT admissible** (reversed lower courts)

#### Rule - Three Conditions for Admissibility
For an oral collateral agreement to be admissible, it must:

1. **In form be a collateral one** (separate agreement)
2. **Not contradict** express or implied provisions of written contract
3. Be one that **parties would not ordinarily be expected to embody** in the writing

Alternative test: Inspection of written contract in light of surrounding circumstances must not indicate that writing contains complete engagements of parties

#### Application
Ice house removal failed the test because:
- Closely related to land sale (not truly collateral)
- Something buyer would naturally include in land purchase contract
- Contract appeared to be complete integration on its face

#### Key Language (Bottom of page 337)
"Two entirely distinct contracts, each for a separate consideration, may be made at the same time, and will be distinct legally"

**BUT**: "If one agreement is entered into, wholly or partly in consideration of the simultaneous agreement to enter into another, the transactions are necessarily bound together"

Test: Is the bond **sufficiently close** to prevent proof of the oral agreement?

#### Significance
- Represents older, more rigid approach
- Later cases adopt more flexible approach (UCC 2-202, Restatement Second § 216)

---

### B. Masterson v. Sine (1968) - Modern/Flexible Approach

#### Citation
- California Supreme Court
- Justice Traynor
- **In Banc** (all justices participated)

#### Facts
- Dallas Masterson and wife owned ranch, conveyed to Medora and Lu Sine (1958)
- Medora was Dallas's sister
- **Grant deed** reserved **option** for grantors to repurchase property within 10 years
- Option exercisable by paying same consideration without depreciation
- Dallas later declared bankruptcy
- Bankruptcy trustee took over estate
- Trustee and Rebecca Masterson sued to enforce option

#### Procedural History
- **Trial court admitted**: Evidence of $50,000 consideration and depreciation definition
- **Trial court excluded**: Parol evidence that option was **personal to Mastersons** (non-assignable, to keep property in family)
- Both parties appealed

#### Issue
Is evidence of separate oral agreement admissible to prove terms of written contract if unclear whether writing intended by parties to be complete?

#### Holding
- Trial court **erred** in excluding evidence
- Evidence that option was personal/non-assignable **should have been admitted**
- Writing appeared to be **partial integration**
- Oral term was **consistent** with writing (not contradictory)

#### Rule - Justice Traynor's Modern Approach
Even if unclear whether written contract intended to be complete, evidence of separate oral agreement **may be admissible** if:
- Oral agreement is something that would be **naturally made as a separate agreement** by parties
- Given their **actual situation and circumstances** when drafting written contract

#### Reasoning
- **Test of admissibility**: Whether oral term might naturally be made as part of separate agreement by the parties
- Evidence of oral collateral agreements should be **excluded only when fact finder likely to be misled**
- Rule must be based on **credibility of evidence**
- Adopts **Restatement of Contracts § 241B** standard

In this case:
- Agreement that option was personal/non-assignable would naturally be separate
- Intent was to keep property within family
- Not inconsistent with written grant deed
- Partial integration allowed supplementation

#### Significance
- Represents **modern, flexible approach**
- Emphasizes credibility and natural expectations over rigid formalism
- **Still good law today** (1968 case)
- Moving away from Mitchell v. Lath's rigid rule

---

### C. Lee v. Joseph E. Seagram & Sons, Inc. (1977) - Different Parties

#### Facts
- Lee family owned 50% of Capital City Liquor Company (Seagram distributor)
- Family decided to sell business
- **Arnold Lee** (age 36) had relationship with Seagram executives
- **Initial oral offer**: Sell Capital City to Seagram on condition they relocate Arnold and sons into new distributor
- **One month later**: Written sales agreement negotiated by different Seagram employees (John Barth)
- **Written contract** (September 1970):
  - Did NOT include promises about new distribution
  - Contained **NO integration clause**
- Seagram failed to provide new business
- Lees sued for breach of oral agreement

#### Procedural History
- Trial court allowed evidence of oral promise
- Jury ruled for Lee
- Second Circuit affirmed

#### Issue
Can evidence of oral agreement relating to later written contract be admitted when parties are not identical and written contract lacks integration clause?

#### Holding
Oral agreement **admissible** - parol evidence rule did NOT bar evidence

#### Reasoning
- Oral agreement admissible because circumstances showed it was **not meant to be part of written sales contract**
- **Different parties** involved:
  - Oral: Arnold Lee and Seagram executives
  - Written: Different Seagram representatives
- No evidence that those drafting written contract even knew of earlier oral promises
- Written agreement was **not total integration**
- Oral promise did **not contradict** written agreement
- Therefore admissible

#### Rule Applied
- Court applied **Corbin approach**
- Emphasized **intent of parties** rather than reasonable interpretation
- Different parties = significant factor
- Absence of integration clause weighs against complete integration

---

### D. George v. Davoli (1977) - UCC 2-202 Application

#### Facts
- George agreed to purchase jewelry from Davoli for $500
- **Written memorandum**: Can return jewelry if doesn't like it, get refund
- **NO time period specified** in writing
- **Oral discussion**: No time period mentioned
- George returned jewelry **following Wednesday**
- **Davoli refused refund**, claiming oral agreement required return by **Monday**

#### Issue
Is oral testimony about Monday deadline admissible under UCC 2-202?

#### Holding
- Evidence of Monday deadline **admissible**
- George **failed to meet deadline**
- Davoli not required to provide refund
- Complaint dismissed

#### Rule - UCC 2-202
**UCC 2-202 compels court** to allow oral testimony supplementing written agreement where:
1. Terms **not inconsistent** with written agreement, OR
2. Writing **not intended as complete and exclusive** statement of terms

Supplemental terms admissible if:
- Written agreement not full and exclusive expression
- Supplemental terms not inconsistent

#### Application
- Memorandum was **not full and exclusive** (no time period included)
- Deadline agreement **not inconsistent** with written memorandum (merely supplemented)
- Appellate Division: Must **contradict very existence** of term to be inconsistent
- Oral Monday deadline did not contradict, only supplemented
- **Therefore admissible**

#### Key Quote (Page 357)
"Section 2-202 of the UCC **compels the court** to allow oral testimony supplementing the written agreement were not inconsistent, or where the writing is not intended as complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement"

#### Significance
- Demonstrates UCC's liberal approach to parol evidence
- Time period for performance can be supplemented by oral evidence
- "Inconsistent" narrowly construed

---

### E. Frigaliment Importing Co. v. B.N.S. International Sales (Chicken Case)

#### Judge
Judge Friendly (noted for being "friendly to the chicken")

#### Facts
- Breach of warranty case - goods should correspond to description
- Two contracts: "U.S. fresh frozen chicken, grade A, government inspected"
  - Specification 1: 2.5 to 3 pounds each
  - Specification 2: 1.5 to 2 pounds each
- **Plaintiff's interpretation**: "Chicken" = young chickens (broilers/fryers) only
- **Defendant's interpretation**: "Chicken" = any chicken (including stewing hens)

#### Issue
What is the meaning of the word "chicken" in the contract?

#### Extrinsic Evidence Examined

**1. Communications Between Parties**
- Mostly cablegrams in German
- German word included both broiler and stewing types
- Inconclusive

**2. Trade Usage**
- Plaintiff's witness (Strassner): "Chicken" means broiler
  - BUT his own contracts specified "broiler" separately
- Defendant's witnesses:
  - Plant operator: "Chicken is everything except goose, duck, and turkey"
  - Must specify which category wanted
  - Food inspection service: Any bird within USDA classes = "chicken"

**3. USDA Regulations**
- § 70.301: "Chickens" includes broiler, fryer, roaster, capon, stag, hen, etc.
- Defendant: Contract incorporated these by "government inspected" language
- Court: Defendant's argument has more force

**4. Market Prices**
- Defendant: Impossible to obtain broilers/fryers at 33-cent price offered
- Market price for broilers was 35-37 cents
- Plaintiff must have known market
- Defendant entitled to some profit

**5. Course of Performance**
- Plaintiff sent cables complaining larger birds were "foul"
- Defendant didn't acknowledge complaint
- Mixed evidence

#### Holding
- Defendant believed it was complying (broader interpretation)
- Defendant's **subjective intent coincided with objective meaning** per USDA regulations
- **Plaintiff had burden** of showing "chicken" used in narrower sense
- **Plaintiff failed to sustain burden**
- **Judgment for defendant**

#### Rule - Interpretation When Ambiguous
**Extrinsic evidence admissible to interpret term when ambiguous**

Court examines successive interpretations:
1. Contract language itself
2. Communications between parties
3. Trade usage
4. Industry definitions (USDA regulations)
5. Market prices
6. Course of performance

#### Significance
- **Pre-UCC case** demonstrating courts allow extrinsic evidence for interpretation
- Extensive analysis of ambiguous terms
- If cannot establish meaning of indispensable term → no remedy possible
- **Malpractice warning**: Don't draft contracts with vague terms

---

### F. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. v. G.W. Thomas Drayage

#### Facts
- PG&E hired Thomas to fix/repair turbines
- Contract included **indemnification clause**: Thomas liable for "any loss, damage, expense, and liability resulting from injury to property"
- While working, Thomas damaged PG&E's turbine cover
- PG&E sued for $25,000 based on indemnification

#### Procedural History
- **Superior Court**: Extrinsic evidence excluded
  - Looked at **plain meaning within four corners**
  - Plain meaning: Applied only to **third party** property, not PG&E's
- **Appellate Court**: **Reversed**

#### Issue
Can extrinsic evidence be introduced when there's issue understanding plain meaning of language within four corners of contract?

#### Holding
- **Extrinsic evidence admissible**
- If issue understanding plain meaning, court can look to extrinsic evidence to understand **intent of parties**
- Intent was to protect against third party claims, not PG&E's property
- **Not barred by parol evidence rule**

#### Rule - Language Susceptible to Multiple Meanings

**Definition to memorize**:
"If there is language in the contract that is **susceptible to two or more meanings** [OR] **reasonably susceptible to two or more meanings**, the extrinsic evidence **can come in** to:
- Show the meaning intended by the parties, OR
- Prove a meaning to which the language is reasonably susceptible"

**Extrinsic evidence can include**:
- Emails regarding contract
- Oral testimony between parties
- Any evidence showing intended meaning

#### Justice Traynor's Limitations
- **Preliminary consideration** by **court** (not jury, not full trial)
- Judge makes preliminary determination
- Bring in all **credible evidence**
- Reviewed solely by judge
- Admission only if, considering all extrinsic evidence, contract susceptible to either interpretation

#### Significance
- If issue understanding plain meaning, extrinsic evidence admissible
- **Not violation** of parol evidence rule - interpretation exception
- Different from consistent/inconsistent analysis

---

### G. Trident Center v. Connecticut General Life Insurance (1988)

#### Court
- **Ninth Circuit** (federal appellate court)
- Applied California law
- Judge: Alex Kozinski

#### Facts
- **Plaintiff**: Trident Center (partnership of insurance company and law firms)
- Borrowed **$56.5 million** from Connecticut General Life Insurance
- **Promissory note** stated: "Trident **shall not have the right to prepay** principal amount before January 1996"
- **Separate clause**: "In event of prepayment resulting from **default** prior to January 1996, prepayment fee will be **10%**"
- When interest rates dropped, Trident wanted to refinance
- **Trident's argument**: Second clause allowed prepayment if willing to pay 10% fee
- **Lender's position**: Clear prohibition on prepayment during first 12 years

#### Issue
Under California law, can extrinsic parol evidence be introduced to show contract means something different from its plain language, even when contract appears clear and unambiguous?

#### Holding
- **Affirmed dismissal** (contract clearly barred prepayment before 1996)
- BUT **reversed sanctions** - claim not frivolous given California's broad parol evidence doctrine
- Recognized under California law, parol evidence **could theoretically be admissible**

#### Reasoning
- **No genuine ambiguity** in written terms
- Default clause only applied if lender chose to accelerate after default
- Did NOT apply if Trident voluntarily prepaid
- Nonetheless, California's Pacific Gas precedent permits parties to offer parol evidence even when written contract seems unambiguous
- Court **critical of this rule** but bound to follow California law
- California law makes it **impossible** for even sophisticated parties to draft contract immune to parol evidence

#### Court's Criticism
- Contract had "extremely clear contractual provisions"
- Despite this, California law still potentially allows parol evidence
- Even sophisticated parties (insurance companies, law firms) with clear language cannot completely bar parol evidence

#### Significance
- Shows California and Ninth Circuit taking **very liberal approach** to admissibility
- Even clear language may be subject to parol evidence if susceptible to multiple interpretations
- Current trend: Evidence may come in even when language clear on face
- Illustrates tension between plain meaning and liberal parol evidence rules

### H. Val-Ford Realty - Evidence Contract is No Contract at All

#### Key Quote (Page 357)
"While parol evidence is generally inadmissible to **contradict, vary, add to, or subtract from** the terms of an integrated agreement (such as the instant lease and guarantee), it is **admissible to show that a writing, although purporting to be a contract, is in fact no contract at all**"

#### Principle
Parol evidence rule does NOT bar evidence showing:
- Contract was fraudulent
- Contract was sham/fake
- No real contract existed (just appearance)
- Contract procured through fraud

#### Example: Fraudulent "Gift" Contracts
Four women each paid $180K-200K to man who:
- Was dating all simultaneously
- Signed contracts showing money as "gifts" (not loans)
- Purpose: Deceive bank to secure large loan
- Actually were loans, not gifts

**Parol evidence admissible** to show:
- Contracts were phony/fraudulent
- True intent was loans
- Used to fraudulently obtain bank financing
- No real contract - just fraud

#### Example: Fraudulent Conveyance
- Party gets sued, transfers property to spouse/family
- Witnesses heard: "This is to prevent us from losing the property"
- Evidence of sham transfer admissible
- Not subject to parol evidence rule

#### Rule
Anytime evidence shows contract formation defect (fraud, duress, no meeting of minds), evidence comes in - not subject to parol evidence bar

---

## III. UCC 2-202 - Presumption of Partial Integration

### A. Text and Effect

**UCC 2-202 Rule**:
Terms in writing intended by parties as final expression **may not be contradicted** by evidence of prior agreement or contemporaneous oral agreement

**BUT may be explained or supplemented**:
- By course of dealing, usage of trade, or course of performance
- By evidence of **consistent additional terms** UNLESS court finds writing intended as **complete and exclusive** statement

### B. Critical Presumption
**UCC 2-202 PRESUMES all contracts are PARTIALLY INTEGRATED**
- This is rebuttable presumption
- Party can overcome by showing complete integration
- Default position: Partial integration
- **UCC compels court** to allow supplemental evidence

### C. Why UCC is Liberal

**Policy Reasons**:
1. Rigid rules don't fully show intent of parties
2. UCC wants to promote contract formation
3. Recognition that most commercial contracts evolve
4. Reflects reality of commercial dealings

**Practical Effect**:
- Evidence that supplements (if consistent) generally admissible
- Burden on party claiming complete integration to prove it
- Unless party shows fully integrated agreement, supplemental consistent terms come in

---

## IV. Restatement Provisions

### A. Restatement (Second) § 209 - Is Writing an Integration?
- Writing **not assented to** by parties as final expression is **not a final integration**
- Even if labeled "draft" or "preliminary," can become binding if parties assent
- Intent to finalize is key

### B. Restatement (Second) § 216 - Integrated Agreements
- More flexible approach than Mitchell v. Lath
- Referenced in modern cases as new approach
- Less formal than traditional rules
- Post-Mitchell modernization

### C. Restatement § 241B - Collateral Agreement Test
Cited in Masterson v. Sine

Permits proof of collateral agreement if:
- "Such an agreement as **might naturally be made as a separate agreement** by the parties"
- Considering situation parties were in when creating written contract
- Natural omission test

---

## V. When Parol Evidence IS Admissible - Exceptions

### A. To Show Contract is No Contract at All
- **Fraud**
- **Sham/fake contract**
- No meeting of minds
- Illegality
- Contract formation defects
- See Val-Ford Realty

### B. To Interpret Ambiguous or Vague Terms
- Language susceptible to two or more reasonable meanings
- See Frigaliment (chicken case)
- See Pacific Gas & Electric
- **NOT violation** of parol evidence rule - interpretation
- Even in fully integrated contract, can interpret vague language

### C. To Show Modification (Post-Contract)
- Evidence of agreement made **after** contract signing
- Not parol evidence issue at all - modification question
- Requires consideration OR consideration substitute
- No parol evidence bar (not prior to/contemporaneous with contract)

### D. Collateral Agreements
- Must meet tests from Mitchell v. Lath or Masterson v. Sine
- "Naturally made as separate agreement" test
- Not so closely related that would naturally be in main contract
- See Lee v. Seagram (different parties factor)

### E. To Supplement Partially Integrated Agreement
- If contract is partial integration
- Evidence **consistent** with writing
- Cannot contradict
- UCC 2-202 presumes partial integration

### F. Course of Dealing, Course of Performance, Trade Usage
UCC allows evidence of:
- Prior dealings between parties
- How parties performed this contract
- Custom and practice in the trade
- Even if not in writing, helps interpret terms

### G. To Show Condition Precedent to Formation
- Evidence contract not effective until condition occurs
- Goes to formation, not terms
- Not barred by parol evidence rule

### H. To Show Agreement Was Never Final/Complete
- No integration occurred
- Still in draft/negotiation stage
- Parties didn't assent as final expression (Restatement § 209)

---

## VI. Types of Terms and Consistency Analysis

### A. Consistent Additional Terms
- **Admissible** in partial integration
- Must not contradict anything in writing
- Supplements the agreement
- Example: Adding detail not mentioned in contract

### B. Contradictory Terms
- **Never admissible** (whether full or partial integration)
- Cannot contradict express or implied provisions
- Courts strictly enforce this
- Even under liberal California/UCC approach

### C. Terms That Would Naturally Be Included
- Strong evidence of complete integration if omitted
- If reasonable parties would include it, and they didn't → probably not part of deal
- Natural omission test (determines if partial or complete integration)

---

## VII. Integration Clauses (Merger Clauses)

### A. Effect of Merger Clause
- Creates **presumption** of complete integration
- States contract is "entire agreement"
- Typical language: "This agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties"
- Raises red flag for party claiming partial integration
- Must overcome presumption

### B. Overcoming Merger Clause
- Not conclusive - rebuttable presumption
- Party can still argue:
  - Despite clause, particular matter not addressed
  - Parties didn't intend clause to cover specific issue
  - Evidence shows intent otherwise
- But difficult to overcome

### C. Example from Lee v. Seagram
- Contract had **NO integration clause**
- Factor weighing toward partial integration
- Absence of merger clause significant in court's analysis

---

## VIII. Problem Sets and Applications

### Problem 1 - Draft Not Final
**Facts**: A and B made oral agreement, signed writing incorporating terms. Not fully satisfied with writing. Agreed to have it redrafted.

**Question**: Does writing constitute integration?

**Answer**: **NO**
- Restatement Second § 209
- Writing not assented to as final expression is not final integration
- Even though signed, parties intended to redraft
- Intent controls

---

### Problem 3 - Construction Loan with Merger Clause
**Facts**:
- Construction loan to build house
- Written contract:
  - **Merger clause present**
  - Stated selection of contractor was "exclusive responsibility of borrower"
- Plaintiff offers evidence of oral agreement:
  - Defendant would help select contractor
  - Guarantee contractor's competence
  - Supervise construction

**Question**: Should evidence be excluded?

**Answer**: **YES**
1. Merger clause suggests complete integration
2. Oral evidence **contradicts** express written provision (borrower's exclusive responsibility)
3. Cannot introduce contradictory evidence even in partial integration
4. If parties intended defendant's responsibility, plaintiff wouldn't have signed contract with contrary term

---

### Problem 6 - UCC Confirmation Memoranda

#### Sub-Problem A
**Facts**: Buyer and seller exchanged correspondence, entered contract for goods. Terms: A (subject matter), B (quantity), C (warranty). Seller sends written confirmation stating terms A and B only.

**Question**: Could buyer prove existence of term C?

**Answer**: **YES**
- UCC 2-202 presumes partial integration
- Confirmation is partial integration
- Term C is consistent additional term
- Admissible to supplement

#### Sub-Problem B
**Facts**: Seller's confirmation states: "A, B, and **not C**" (disclaimer of warranties)

**Question**: Could buyer prove term C?

**Answer**: Complex two-part analysis
1. **Parol evidence analysis**:
   - Term C contradicts confirmation ("not C")
   - If confirmation is integration, term C excluded (contradicts)
2. **Substantive UCC warranty law**:
   - Can you disclaim warranties via confirmation memo?
   - **Likely NO** - substantially limits party's rights
   - Similar to arbitration clause
   - Disclaimer attacks substantive consumer rights
   - Courts won't allow unilateral disclaimer of substantial rights via post-contract confirmation
   - Would be material alteration under UCC 2-207

#### Sub-Problem C
**Facts**: Both buyer and seller sent confirmations with A and B, omitting C

**Question**: Could buyer prove term C?

**Answer**: **YES**
- Both omitted C (didn't actively exclude it)
- UCC 2-202 presumes partial integration
- Can bring in original contract/agreement evidence
- Doesn't contradict confirmations - supplements them
- Shows term was part of original deal

---

### Problem 7 - Sham Contract (Independent Contractor)
**Facts**:
- Plaintiff worked for defendant one year as employee with fixed salary
- Parties then signed document stating plaintiff was **independent contractor**
- New writing: Paid per work done, carry workers' comp insurance
- Plaintiff sues on initial employment contract for unpaid salary
- Offers to testify second agreement **not intended to be binding**
- Purpose was to enable defendant to avoid workers' compensation law

**Question**: Is evidence admissible?

**Answer**: **YES**
- Can show contract was **sham/fraudulent**
- Evidence comes in to show no real contract at all
- Purpose was illegal (evade workers' comp law)
- Not subject to parol evidence bar
- Knucklehead v. Lewis (1939)

---

## IX. Interpretation vs. Parol Evidence

### A. Critical Distinction

#### When It's Interpretation (Always Admissible)
- Language in contract is **vague or ambiguous**
- Term susceptible to two or more reasonable meanings
- Need to clarify what parties meant by specific term
- Example: "Porsche" - which car? model? year?
- Example: "Chicken" - broiler or any fowl?
- **NOT parol evidence issue** - interpretation issue

#### Interpretation in Fully Integrated Contract
- Even if contract is **complete integration**
- Still can bring in evidence to interpret vague term
- Cannot bring in to supplement or contradict
- But CAN bring in to clarify meaning
- Not inconsistent with parol evidence rule

### B. Process for Vague Terms
1. Is there ambiguity/vagueness?
2. If yes, extrinsic evidence admissible
3. Court determines meaning
4. If cannot determine meaning of indispensable term → no remedy possible

### C. Interpretation Example
Contract says "Porsche" but nothing else:
- No model, year, VIN number
- Court would allow extrinsic evidence:
  - What did parties mean?
  - Which car?
  - SUV? Sports car?
- Must interpret before can apply parol evidence rule
- "Figure out what the thing is before we can figure out if it's consistent or inconsistent"

### D. Successive Interpretive Tools (from Frigaliment)
Courts examine in order:
1. Contract language itself
2. Communications between parties
3. Trade usage/custom
4. Industry definitions and regulations
5. Market prices and commercial context
6. Course of dealing/performance
7. Dictionary definitions
8. Expert testimony

---

## X. Exam Strategy and Practice Tips

### A. Essay Writing Approach

#### Always Discuss Intent
- **Never go wrong** mentioning "intent of the parties"
- Don't say "I think" - say "parties intended"
- Safer to argue based on party intent than personal judgment
- Courts enforce what parties intended

#### Standard IRAC Analysis Format

**1. Is this parol evidence?**
- Prior to or contemporaneous with written agreement?
- If after contract → modification, not parol evidence

**2. Integration analysis:**
- Complete or partial integration?
- Look for merger clause
- Apply natural omission test
- What did parties intend?

**3. Consistency analysis:**
- Does evidence contradict or supplement?
- If contradicts: Not admissible (whether full or partial)
- If supplements: Admissible only if partial integration

**4. Exceptions:**
- Is this interpretation of ambiguous term?
- Evidence of fraud/no contract?
- Collateral agreement naturally separate?
- Modification?

#### Conclusion Doesn't Matter
- "Did you state law correctly?"
- "Did you apply facts to law correctly?"
- "If you conclude incorrectly, we don't care"
- "You still get full credit"
- "Your conclusions mean nothing"
- Just spot issue, state rule, apply to facts

### B. Under UCC vs. Common Law

#### UCC Transactions
- **Start with presumption**: Partial integration
- Evidence that supplements (if consistent) likely admissible
- Liberal approach
- Burden on party claiming complete integration

#### Common Law
- More restrictive historically
- Modern trend (Masterson, Traynor) moving toward flexibility
- Still less liberal than UCC
- No automatic presumption of partial integration

### C. Integration Determination

#### If Merger Clause Present
- **Presumption**: Complete integration
- Must overcome presumption to get evidence in
- Difficult but not impossible
- Can argue specific matter not covered

#### If No Merger Clause
- Look to intent of parties
- Natural omission test
- What would reasonable parties do?
- No presumption either way (except under UCC)

### D. Common Pitfalls

1. **Don't confuse interpretation with parol evidence**
   - Vague terms → interpretation (always admissible)
   - Supplementing/contradicting → parol evidence analysis

2. **Don't forget modification**
   - Post-contract agreements not parol evidence
   - Different analysis entirely

3. **Remember UCC presumption**
   - UCC 2-202 presumes partial integration
   - Big advantage for party trying to get evidence in

4. **Contradictory evidence never comes in**
   - Whether full or partial integration
   - Strictly enforced

---

## XI. Professor's Three-Minute Summary

**The Essential Parol Evidence Rule**:

### 1. What is parol evidence?
Any evidence contemporaneous to OR prior to written agreement

### 2. Two questions to ask:

**A. Integration?**
- Complete or partial integration?
- Intent of parties?

**B. Consistency?**
- Does evidence contradict or supplement?

### 3. Simple rules:

**Complete integration**: Nothing comes in (no supplement, no contradict)

**Partial integration**:
- Supplemental consistent terms come in
- Contradictory terms do NOT come in

### 4. Exceptions (evidence always comes in for):
- **Fraud** - show contract was sham
- **No contract** - show no agreement at all
- **Interpretation** - clarify vague/ambiguous term

### 5. That's it!
"Don't read too much into parol evidence. That's the whole crock of parol evidence. Watch this tape, 3 minutes, that's all you need to know."

### 6. What graders look for:
- Did you state law correctly?
- Did you apply facts to law correctly?
- Don't care about your conclusion
- Just IRAC it properly

---

## XII. Key Definitions

### Bolded Terms to Know

- **Integration** - Final written expression of agreement (complete or partial)
- **Complete/Total Integration** - Final AND complete expression; no supplementation or contradiction
- **Partial Integration** - Final but not complete; can supplement (if consistent), cannot contradict
- **Parol Evidence** - Evidence prior to or contemporaneous with written agreement (oral or written)
- **Merger Clause** (Integration Clause) - Clause stating contract is entire agreement; creates presumption of complete integration
- **Collateral Agreement** - Separate agreement related to main contract; may be admissible if "naturally made as separate"
