# Torts - Session 02: Intentional Torts

## Purpose of Tort Law

- **Goal**: Make the plaintiff whole again
- **Only remedy**: Money damages
- **Nature**: Tort is a **civil wrong** (not criminal)

## Theory of Recovery

- **Key term**: **Cause of action** (legal term for "theory of recovery")
- Always ask: "What is my cause of action?"

## Tort as a Fault-Based System

- **Tort is fault-based**: If you cannot prove fault, you cannot recover
- **Three pathways to prove fault:**
  1. **Intentional act** (intentional torts)
  2. **Negligence** (most of the course)
  3. **Strict liability** (abnormally dangerous activities)

---

## I. INTENT

### A. Specific Intent

**Rule**: An actor intends the consequences of his conduct if his goal is to bring about those consequences.

- **Example**: You punch me in the face intending to do so
- The defendant's **goal** was to bring about the harmful result

### B. General Intent

**Rule**: An actor intends the consequences of his conduct if he knows with **substantial certainty** that those consequences will occur.

- **Key phrase**: "**Substantial certainty**" (very high threshold)
- Not just ordinary or probable—must be substantially certain
- **Example**: Swinging a cane in proximity to someone's face where you know with substantial certainty you will strike them

**Important Limitations:**
- Do not overuse general intent
- Not every careless act meets the "substantial certainty" standard
- Texting and driving that causes a rear-end collision is **not** general intent—it's **negligence**

### C. Relationship Between Intent and Negligence

- If you **cannot** prove intentional conduct (specific or general intent), move to **negligence**
- Negligence = conduct that falls below the standard of care of a reasonable, prudent person under the circumstances

## II. BATTERY

### A. Definition

**Battery** is an **intentional act** that causes a **harmful or offensive touching** of the **plaintiff's person**.

### B. Prima Facie Elements

To prove battery, plaintiff must establish:

1. **Intent** (specific or general)
2. **Act** (volitional act)
3. **Causation**
4. **Harmful or offensive** touching
5. **Of the plaintiff's person**

### C. Key Rules

#### 1. Intent

- **Intent has nothing to do with malice**
- No showing of malice, ill will, or bad motive required
- Only requires a **volitional act** performed with purpose to cause harm OR knowledge of substantial certainty that result would be harmful or offensive

**Case**: *Garratt v. Dailey*
- 5-year-old Brian pulled chair out from under plaintiff
- Intent = pulling the chair (volitional act) + knowledge with substantial certainty that she would fall
- **Not required**: that he intended to break her hip—only that he knew she would contact the ground

#### 2. Act Must Be Volitional

**Rule**: An act must be a **volitional act** (a conscious act).

**Non-volitional acts** (no battery):
- Epileptic seizure causing you to strike someone
- Fainting and hitting someone on the way down
- Stroke causing you to rear-end someone

**Case**: *Cohen v. Petty*
- Defendant fainted while driving and lost control
- Fainting = **not a volitional act**, so **no intent**
- **However**: If defendant had a **history** of fainting, the act of driving itself could be **negligent** (even though fainting itself is non-volitional)
- California law: Doctors must report epilepsy to DMV; license suspended until condition is controlled

#### 3. Causation

- In intentional torts, causation is **exceedingly simple**
- **Example**: You punched me in the face → caused my jaw to break
- (Causation becomes much more complex in negligence)

#### 4. Harmful or Offensive

**Rule**: What is harmful or offensive is determined by a **reasonable person's standard**.

- **Not subjective**: Not based on what the individual plaintiff finds offensive
- **Example**: Tapping someone on the shoulder to ask for directions = not harmful or offensive
- **Example**: Unwanted hug may be battery (depends on reasonable person standard)

#### 5. Of the Plaintiff's Person

**Rule**: Anything **intimately connected** to the plaintiff's person is a part of the plaintiff's person.

**Examples of intimate connection:**
- Yanking someone's tie
- Grabbing someone's coat
- Flipping someone's baseball cap
- Even though you never touched the plaintiff's body, it satisfies the touching element

**Questions of fact for jury:**
- Is the item intimately connected to plaintiff's person?
- Example: If plaintiff's elbow is resting on a table and you bang the table, is the table intimately connected? → Jury decides

### D. Damages Not Required

- **Damages are NOT a prima facie element** of battery
- You can recover for battery even without proving damages
- Look at the rule—damages is not listed as an element

### E. Mental Illness and Intent

**Rule**: **Mental illness does not negate intent.**

**Case**: *McGuire v. Almy* (1937)
- Mentally ill nursing home patient struck nurse with furniture leg
- Court held: Mentally ill person is liable for intentional torts under same circumstances as non-mentally ill person
- **Rationale**: Law will not inquire into mental condition to excuse intent

**Case**: *Wagner v. State* (2005)
- Mentally disabled man attacked plaintiff at Kmart
- To commit battery, defendant must have **intended the contact** that was harmful or offensive
- **Not required**: intent to harm—only intent to make the contact
- Mentally handicapped people **can form** requisite intent

**Policy**:
- We prosecute and incarcerate mentally ill people
- Exception: **Insanity defense** = cannot tell difference between right and wrong (very high threshold)
- If insanity defense successful, person committed to institution until no longer a danger

---

## III. STRICT LIABILITY (Brief Introduction)

**Rule**: Liability **without fault**.

- Applies when defendant engages in **abnormally dangerous activity**
  - Also called "ultra-hazardous activity" in older cases
- Examples: Dynamite blasting, keeping wild/dangerous animals (crocodiles, not poodles)

**Elements:**
- Defendant engaged in abnormally dangerous activity
- Activity caused injury to plaintiff
- **No need to show fault or negligence**

**Policy**: Increase the cost of engaging in dangerous activities

**Case**: *Spano v. Perini Corp.*
- Blasting contractor caused damage
- Plaintiffs did not prove negligence
- Court imposed strict liability for abnormally dangerous activity
- Question: Who should bear cost? Person engaged in dangerous activity or innocent neighbor?

## IV. ASSAULT

### A. Definition

**Assault** is an **intentional act** by the defendant that places the plaintiff in the **imminent apprehension** of a **harmful or offensive touching**.

### B. Prima Facie Elements

1. **Intent** (specific or general)
2. **Act** (volitional)
3. **Causation**
4. **Imminent apprehension**
5. **Of harmful or offensive touching**

### C. Key Rules

#### 1. Assault vs. Battery Distinguished

- **Assault** = imminent apprehension of harmful/offensive touching (no contact required)
- **Battery** = actual harmful/offensive touching

**Examples:**
- Point a gun at someone → **assault** (but not battery)
- Throw brick at someone's back (they don't see it coming) → **battery only** (no assault)
- Throw brick while facing someone → **assault and battery** (they see it coming, then it hits)

#### 2. Apparent Ability Sufficient

**Rule**: Defendant's **apparent ability** to assault is sufficient. Actual ability is irrelevant.

**Example**: Gun is unloaded
- If plaintiff didn't know gun was unloaded → assault
- Defendant's apparent ability to harm is what matters

#### 3. Words Alone Insufficient

**Rule**: **Words alone** are insufficient to constitute assault.

**Example**: "I'm going to kill you" (words only) → **NOT assault**
- May be **intentional infliction of emotional distress** (covered later)
- But not assault

**However**: Words **accompanied by an overt act** may constitute assault.
- "I'm going to hit you" while raising fist → **assault**
- The overt act (raising fist) + words = assault

#### 4. Apprehension Must Be Immediate

**Rule**: The apprehension of harmful or offensive contact must be **immediate**.

**Example**: "I'm going to hit you tomorrow" → **NOT assault**
- Future threats don't create imminent apprehension

---

## V. FALSE IMPRISONMENT

### A. Definition

**False imprisonment** is an **intentional act** or **omission to act** (where there is a duty to act) that **confines or restrains** the plaintiff to a **bounded area**.

### B. Prima Facie Elements

1. **Intent** (specific or general)
2. **Act** (or omission to act where duty exists)
3. **Causation**
4. **Confinement or restraint**
5. **To a bounded area**

*Note: Every intentional tort shares three common elements: Intent, Act, Causation*

### C. Methods of Confinement or Restraint

Plaintiff can prove confinement through **any one** of the following methods:

#### 1. Physical Barriers

- Locking a door
- Blocking an exit
- Creating a physical obstacle to movement

#### 2. Physical Force

- Grabbing plaintiff's wrist
- Holding plaintiff's coat
- Physically restraining plaintiff
- **Note**: This also constitutes **battery**

#### 3. Threat of Force

**Rule**: Threat of force can be directed at **plaintiff** or **someone else**.

**Examples:**
- Police officer points gun and says "don't move" → false imprisonment
- Someone threatens harm to your child if you move → false imprisonment

#### 4. Failure to Provide Means of Escape

**Rule**: Failure to provide means of escape **where there is an affirmative duty to do so**.

**Example**:
- Promise to drive someone to airport and let them out
- Arrive at airport but refuse to unlock doors
- Duty to act arose from the promise

**Example**: Immigrant ship case
- Promise to let passenger disembark in United States
- Failure to honor promise = omission to act where duty existed

### D. Awareness Requirement

**Rule**: **Awareness of confinement is required** for false imprisonment.

**Examples:**
- Sleeping in room, someone locks you in → **NOT false imprisonment** until you try to leave and discover you're locked in
- At campus, doors locked but you don't know → **NOT false imprisonment** until you go to door and can't get out
- The moment you become aware you cannot leave → false imprisonment begins

### E. Intent Requirement

- Must be an **intentional** act (specific or general intent)
- If someone accidentally locks you in without knowing you're there → **NOT false imprisonment** (no intent)

## VI. EXAM TIPS

### Study Methods

1. **Type your own notes** - aids memorization
2. **Repetition is key** - repeat rules like "Sunday school"
3. **Memorize black letter law** - speeds up bar exam performance
4. **Focus on analysis, not conclusions** - "How did you get there?"

### Analytical Framework (IRAC)

1. **Issue**: What is the cause of action?
2. **Rule**: What is the black letter law?
3. **Application**: Apply facts to the rule
4. **Conclusion**: Did plaintiff meet all prima facie elements?

### Key Principle

- **Don't look inside for answers** ("What do I think?")
- **Look to the rule** - find the applicable law
- **Apply the rule to facts** - this is where points are earned

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Confusing specific intent with general intent
- Applying "substantial certainty" too broadly
- Forgetting that damages are not required for battery
- Thinking words alone can constitute assault
- Confusing criminal law terms with civil tort law (e.g., "guilty" vs. "liable")

## VIII. KEY TERMINOLOGY

- **Adjudication**: Judicial determination; court making a finding
- **Cause of action**: Theory of recovery; legal basis for lawsuit
- **Volitional act**: Conscious act (not reflexive or unconscious)
- **Prima facie elements**: The required components/ingredients of each cause of action
- **Substantial certainty**: Very high threshold; nearly certain to occur
- **Imminent apprehension**: Immediate expectation or fear
- **Bounded area**: Confined space from which plaintiff cannot escape
- **Post hoc ergo propter hoc**: Latin - "after this, therefore because of this" (logical fallacy)
- **Sine qua non**: Latin - "without which it cannot be" (causation in fact)

---

## IX. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CAUSES OF ACTION

### When to Use Each:

**Battery** → Actual harmful/offensive contact occurred
**Assault** → Placed in imminent fear of contact (no actual contact required)
**False Imprisonment** → Confined to area, cannot leave

### Multiple Causes of Action:

- **Same act can be multiple torts**
- Example: Security guard grabs your wrist to prevent you from leaving
  - **Battery** (harmful/offensive touching)
  - **False imprisonment** (physical force restraining you)

### If Intent Fails:

- If cannot prove specific or general intent → try **negligence**
- Negligence = conduct falling below reasonable person standard
