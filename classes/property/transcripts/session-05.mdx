# Property - Session 05

## Transcript

LAX Room 2: Oh, texture starts.

Daniel Saghian ----: Oh, fuck.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Does anyone have any questions from last week?

maddykoshkaryan: No.

Yessenia Soria: I have one professor. I wasn't gonna call you during the weekend, but I figured it's Labor Day weekend, I don't want to bother him. He's probably barbecuing, getting a tan.

Yessenia Soria: So, I waited. I mean, I was gonna wait a couple days, but…

Yessenia Soria: Since you asked. Okay, so, on the estates, you know how you say we have to owner…

Yessenia Soria: Gives it to A, and it has to hit his, hers, and… his,

Yessenia Soria: heirs? So, what if that property has

Yessenia Soria: A co-owner. How does that go about?

John Rogers: We will learn about that

John Rogers: In 4 weeks.

Yessenia Soria: Oh, okay.

John Rogers: Maybe 5.

Yessenia Soria: Oh, okay.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Yessenia Soria: Can we ask questions about the readings, or does it have to be from last week?

John Rogers: Well, from last week, but thank you for… Putting a target on yourself.

Yessenia Soria: Oh, okay, sorry.

John Rogers: No questions from last week?

Yessenia Soria: So, basically, on… when we do the owner to A to the…

Yessenia Soria: He is, hers. We have to make sure we, on the wording, we're precise what we want to say, not the intent to try to say something, right?

Yessenia Soria: Like, oh, I'm giving you… I want to give him my property when I die.

Yessenia Soria: But… It's not concrete on the paperwork saying.

Yessenia Soria: I want to give my children my property when I die.

Yessenia Soria: That'll make sense, huh?

John Rogers: I'm not sure I'm following, so…

Yessenia Soria: Okay, so, like, say I… I said, oh, I want to give my kids my property. They could go 50-50.

Yessenia Soria: And… Let's say I don't do a will or an estate.

Yessenia Soria: Does it automatically go based on what I put in my paperwork as my beneficiaries, or does it have to be

Yessenia Soria: Precise on a document saying, both my children get 50-50 off my property.

John Rogers: So you don't have a will, right?

Yessenia Soria: No.

John Rogers: And so you said you wrote on a piece of paper.

Yessenia Soria: Well, I'm just using an example. I didn't write it in a piece of paper, but let's just say it's divided, like, in my 401K and my.

John Rogers: Okay.

Yessenia Soria: My pension, that's how I want it to be. But it's not in a will.

Yessenia Soria: Is it still valid 50-50, even though it's…

John Rogers: Potentially, yeah. It will go to your heirs, okay?

John Rogers: You don't know who your heirs are. No matter how much you think you know, you don't.

John Rogers: Errors are determined at death.

John Rogers: So, if you ever say, oh, this is my son or my daughter, they're my heir, you're… no.

John Rogers: Errors are determined at death.

John Rogers: I would assume that your assets

John Rogers: would go to your heirs, which I would assume would encompass your children?

John Rogers: So… It would probably just go to them.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, thank you, Professor.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

doven: No, I just want to say, but real property, heirs are determined,

doven: At death, they get the property.

John Rogers: Yes.

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: So if I… if I designate something, we'll learn this in a couple weeks.

John Rogers: few weeks. If I say, you know, O to…

John Rogers: A, and then to the heirs of B.

John Rogers: B's heirs are unascertainable until B dies.

John Rogers: It's kind of very… it's weird how errors are actually determined.

John Rogers: when you get to wills, Trusts, and Estates.

John Rogers: It goes down, but if there are complications, it then kind of wings out, and then goes up, and then back down again. It's kind of a really weird,

John Rogers: Protocol to follow when you are determining errors.

John Rogers: But just remember, you don't know who your heirs are.

John Rogers: You don't know. They are determined when you die.

John Rogers: Don't know.

Yessenia Soria: Who determines that, then?

John Rogers: Like I said, you will learn all about that in wills, Trusts, and Estates.

Yessenia Soria: I…

John Rogers: I like that class because it saves me the time from saying a lot of things.

John Rogers: So, I like it, and I could just refer you to it.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, since we don't have any questions from last week, I just assume everyone's got it, everyone feels really good, they've got this, they have no issues, we don't need to be friends, blah blah blah blah blah, okay?

John Rogers: We don't need to be friends.

John Rogers: Though, I think I definitely have one friend now, I'm open for more friends, so…

John Rogers: And I get kind of nervous when I don't have any friends week 10.

John Rogers: Give me one moment.

John Rogers: I don't know if we will get into the book.

John Rogers: Yet Let me see.

Yessenia Soria: Professor?

Yessenia Soria: So, just to be clear, I'm gonna be your friend.

Yessenia Soria: So, the fee, simple, absolute, we… that's when we put the O to the A to the his, hers, and higher, errors, right? Modern law, we don't need the his, hers.

Yessenia Soria: errors, right? Which is neat O to the A?

Yessenia Soria: For life?

Yessenia Soria: What am I not saying?

Yessenia Soria: Well, I'm going based on my notes, but yeah, it is.

Yessenia Soria: I just want to make sure if I'm capturing it, not being… going based on notes or anything.

Yessenia Soria: Because I've been listening to my audios and reading my…

John Rogers: What I think you should do is, if you want to base things from memory, call me after class, and we'll talk all you want on… about memory. From right now, go with what your notes say.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, thank you. Alright, thank you.

John Rogers: Yeah, I don't know if I'll get into the book tonight. There's a lot to cover.

John Rogers: So we're gonna go… But no one knows how my counterpart

John Rogers: Dolmagian is, how far she's at. And I saw her last night, I forgot to ask her.

John Rogers: You don't know how far her class has gone?

Clarissa Terrazas: Not at all, Professor.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Okay, so we are still in present interest, okay? Oh, I always designate as the owner the presumable feasible absolute holder, and is conveying something, okay?

John Rogers: Is conveying something to someone, a group of people, or entity.

John Rogers: A is generally who has it now. O to A, those are present possessory interests, and that's what we are learning tonight. Next week, we will probably get into

John Rogers: future interest holders, and that's B, C, D, E, and F.

John Rogers: But right now, we're just determining who has what right now.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: You guys see my screen okay?

John Rogers: Yep. So, it's present interests, okay?

John Rogers: So, we're gonna meet. Oh… to A, then to B, then to C.

John Rogers: Okay? A equals a present… possessory.

John Rogers: Interest holder.

John Rogers: Okay? That's what this chapter is.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Future interests is once O conveys to A, O, or O's heirs.

John Rogers: or whomever O designates when O dies.

John Rogers: also becomes a future interest holder. So just think of A as who has this right now.

John Rogers: Everyone else is a future interest holder.

John Rogers: This chapter is all about A.

John Rogers: Now… Now… I will be talking about what O might have.

John Rogers: and what B might have.

John Rogers: But when I talk about that, it's mostly for note-taking purposes. We will cover it.

John Rogers: But… don't kill yourself tonight.

John Rogers: Now, the rule statements, I think, are very important, because if you ask a question, I might snark at you and say, what's the rule? What's the rule? Read the rule to me, okay? And it will be, hints.

John Rogers: Of what something is, is in the rule.

John Rogers: Many of the rules that I provided you start with a present possessory interest holder, or a future interest holder. Okay, so that is a bit telling for you.

John Rogers: And… There will be hints in it.

John Rogers: So… know what is highlighted in yellow, maybe, I think it is?

John Rogers: And… it should really help you.

John Rogers: So, just to do a quick history lesson from last week, Under the common law.

John Rogers: If I wanted to convey a the simple absolute to A, O would just say O to A. And, his or her heir heirs, okay?

John Rogers: That creates a phi simple absolute in A.

John Rogers: Remember, it HAS to contain errors. I don't care what it says.

John Rogers: It's gotta say airs.

John Rogers: Doesn't say errors? That's a problem.

John Rogers: If you wanted to convey life, It would be… Oh, today!

John Rogers: A has a present possessory interest in a life estate with…

John Rogers: Let's see, with A being the measuring length.

John Rogers: Huh.

John Rogers: There you go.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: It could be O to A for life, that's fine.

John Rogers: still operates as a life estate under the common law, okay? Common law.

John Rogers: These are the basic GED Basics to present possessory interests.

John Rogers: Modernly, to convey a phi simple absolute, O just simply goes O to A.

John Rogers: that, A, has a present possessory interest in a fee.

John Rogers: Simple absolute.

John Rogers: Okay? That's the largest maximum, ownership interest.

John Rogers: A can freely assign it, A can sell it, A can do whatever A wants.

John Rogers: The presumption is, is that O to A, it presumes that O is transferring everything, and need not,

John Rogers: Incorporate any further language in it.

John Rogers: To create a present possessory interest in a life estate.

John Rogers: It would just simply be O2A for life. It must contain life. That's how we know it's life. Going for A's life. So A has…

John Rogers: A present possessory interest in a life estate with A being…

John Rogers: The measuring life. Now, the reason I spell all that out for you is we learned that there are 3 types of life estates, okay? There's 3 types, remember?

John Rogers: There's life of…

John Rogers: Oh.

John Rogers: Then there's, I think it's per… someone's… someone… I think it's per Atreli, if I'm not mistaken.

John Rogers: There's 3 types.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: Thank you.

John Rogers: And then there are 3 types of defeasible life estates.

John Rogers: Okay? Did I… I think I went over this. There's, Determinable.

John Rogers: life estate. Did I… did I go over this?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yeah.

John Rogers: I went over all three.

doven: Yeah, I mean, you just gave it to us, but not in detail. It's… life is subject to a condition subsequent.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: The terminal life estate, and life estate subject to executory limitations.

John Rogers: Beautiful.

John Rogers: We covered this last week, and now we're going to be going into this right now.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Does anyone want to do a quick refresher on fees, or do you got it for right now?

doven: We did that last week, oh, okay.

John Rogers: Do you guys want to do a quick refresher?

Karen Hernandez: Yes.

Fatima Razavi: Yes, please.

John Rogers: There's people writing things right now, I can't see.

Yessenia Soria: Please, Professor.

Sennett Devermont: Yes, please.

John Rogers: Alright, calm down, everyone. Alright, I'll go over it. 3?

John Rogers: typical.

John Rogers: types of fees. So, anytime Any person.

John Rogers: Individual, entity, so let's just say A for right now. Anytime A gets something.

John Rogers: Always think to yourself, is it in life?

John Rogers: Or is it in… P.

John Rogers: That's it?

John Rogers: Is it life or fee? That's it. That's all I want to know.

John Rogers: And then you add more to it.

John Rogers: So there's 3 types of feeds.

John Rogers: There's E Simple, absolute… ugh, can't type.

John Rogers: And that is right here.

John Rogers: The simple absolute, right there, that's what it is. It's as much as you hate it, it's right there.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: There's feet tail, And that doesn't exist modernly. It's common law, and far-reaching minority, I think maybe only.

John Rogers: Three states follow it.

John Rogers: Couple of those states that no one ever cares about going to.

John Rogers: And… it limits… the interest… To the lineal descendants.

John Rogers: of the grantee, so A's lineal descendants.

John Rogers: Think DNA. Blood.

John Rogers: blood.

John Rogers: So, O to A and the heirs of her body.

John Rogers: Heirs of her body.

John Rogers: There you go. DNA.

John Rogers: It doesn't exist, so modernly, it would create a fee-simple absolute. Yes?

doven: No, can you think of a simple absolute as just, like, oh…

doven: Having peace of absolute giving to A.

doven: Something like that.

John Rogers: It's just what it is. I mean, modernly, a fee tail would just operate as a fee-simple absolute. That's why you don't often see it

John Rogers: Anymore. But it's a common law concept, really, only.

John Rogers: And some of the examples in the book.

John Rogers: are common law. In fact, a lot of the examples in your casebook are all taken after the common law, so that's far, far, far well beyond before iPhones.

John Rogers: well before iPhones.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: Sure.

John Rogers: And then there are DEFEASABLE feeds.

John Rogers: Now, Defeasible fees. Notice how it's… there's defeasible life and defeasible fee.

John Rogers: And there are 3 types of defusible fees.

John Rogers: There's fees, simple, determinable.

John Rogers: There is a fee simple, subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: And a fee, simple, subject to executory.

John Rogers: Limitation…

John Rogers: These operate very, very, very similar, okay? Except one only lasts for the duration of someone's life, and the other one is potentially following their estate forever and ever and ever until the end of time.

John Rogers: So… what I will do is, is I will skip.

John Rogers: To this for now.

John Rogers: Then, I will go back and talk about this.

John Rogers: Very… this is very, very commonly tested.

John Rogers: Bar exam, John Rogers Class.

John Rogers: Very commonly tested. Well, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

John Rogers: I wouldn't say… very commonly tested.

John Rogers: I would probably say tested twice in 15 years within essays.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Adverse possession, probably tested 3 times.

John Rogers: If not more.

John Rogers: In 15 years.

John Rogers: But we're talking about this right now. So… Shall we begin?

Clarissa Terrazas: Yes.

John Rogers: All right, thank you, thank you.

John Rogers: So, we are determining what a has, okay? So, O conveys Black Acre, okay? So let's say O… so let's do a determinable life estate. So, O

John Rogers: 2A for life. So what do we have right now?

John Rogers: dot dot dot. What does that…

John Rogers: What does A have right now, modernly? iPhone law.

Karen Hernandez: Life of the grantee?

John Rogers: Correct.

John Rogers: A has a present possessory interest in a life estate, with A being the measuring life. So I'm conveying something to you.

John Rogers: For your life.

John Rogers: When you die, you can't put it in your will. It's only going to last for your life.

John Rogers: Got it?

John Rogers: But… I really like the property, too. I kind of like it, and I don't want you to…

John Rogers: F with it during your life.

John Rogers: So, I'm gonna put on… and I can say the word, the letter F, because my counterpart says TF,

John Rogers: And I've deserved the right to say the similar.

John Rogers: I want to put limitations on use.

John Rogers: So… I convey it.

John Rogers: To you for life.

John Rogers: So long ads.

John Rogers: Black Acre is used for residential purposes only.

John Rogers: So, you have it.

John Rogers: for life.

John Rogers: And in your lifetime, In. Your. Lifetime.

John Rogers: You must, or the property, Must be used for residential purposes only.

John Rogers: So, if you open up a Taekwondo studio, And you also sell

John Rogers: Pizza. Now, where's the best pizza in the United States located?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I feel like you know.

John Rogers: Come on.

John Rogers: This guy has an IQ of 1200.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: So where is it?

John Rogers: I don't know, it… over the years, there has been a big fight among real property land students about whether or not Connecticut or New York has the best pizza.

Fatima Razavi: It's New York, I've lived in both, it's New York.

John Rogers: That means kinetic.

doven: I was gonna say New York, because of their big, large pieces, they know who they're.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: That's right, Dove.

John Rogers: I think Domino's has the best pizza, so it doesn't matter. Problem solved. Moving back to property. Anyways…

John Rogers: You are using this piece of land for residential purposes only, so if you open up a pizza studio, where you teach people on how to

John Rogers: cook sensational Connecticut-style pizzas.

John Rogers: That would be a breach, would it not?

doven: Yes.

John Rogers: Yes, that is correct. The answer is correct. Yes, but yes, you are all right.

John Rogers: So… The question then becomes… What happens if there's a breach?

Sennett Devermont: You become an adverse possessor.

John Rogers: Who's you?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: A.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Yes, but what happens to A's interest?

doven: Does it go back to O?

John Rogers: It does!

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: Correct!

John Rogers: That is absolutely correct. It goes back to O or O's heirs, or whomever O designates.

John Rogers: So, regardless, Oh, we'll get this back, either from a breach, or when A dies.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: So… Another way of looking at this is, O2A.

John Rogers: For life.

John Rogers: as long as…

John Rogers: There's a commonality here.

John Rogers: Let me stop right here. I'll… So, A, in this situation.

John Rogers: So I'll break this down for you, okay?

John Rogers: O presumably has a fee simple absolute, okay? Presumably, let's just begin with O. Conveys something. So A then has a present.

John Rogers: possessory interest in a determinable, like… look.

John Rogers: Life estate.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Now…

John Rogers: the maximum amount of time it will ever be in A will ever have it is A's life. So it has to go somewhere when A dies or if A breaches.

John Rogers: And there's no B or C. It's just O and A.

John Rogers: So, O will retain a future interest, as I said, O, but we're really learning about A tonight, but we're going to learn a little bit about O and B a little bit.

John Rogers: Oh, we'll retain a future interest. Actually, two of them.

John Rogers: Also known as a reversion.

John Rogers: Okay? A reversion.

John Rogers: And what will happen is, is that once A dies, the property will automatically go back to O.

John Rogers: It's a reversion.

John Rogers: a reversion O will always retain a reversion.

John Rogers: When a present possessory interest in a life estate is conveyed, Okay?

John Rogers: Unless there's a third, fourth party, as we'll learn.

John Rogers: But in this interest, O will retain a reversion, which means that it will go back to O upon A's death.

John Rogers: You with me so far?

John Rogers: O in this situation, will also Possess a possibility of reverter.

John Rogers: It might be easier just to go to fees, but okay.

John Rogers: possibility of reverter, okay? Notice it says

John Rogers: possibility. It doesn't say guaranteed, it's just possible.

John Rogers: Possibility of reverter.

John Rogers: is retained by O by operation of law whenever a determinable estate is conveyed.

John Rogers: And… If there's ever a breach…

John Rogers: It's the possibility of reverter that kicks in, that takes it away.

John Rogers: from A.

John Rogers: So this determinable life estate automatically forfeits from A.

John Rogers: If a breaches.

John Rogers: It's an automatic forfeiture.

doven: Can I ask the question? Yes. So, reversion, he's gonna get it back when Abe pass away.

John Rogers: Joe could be a.

doven: Oh, oh yeah, oh, he…

John Rogers: Olivia.

doven: Yeah.

doven: reversion, he can… he will get… automatically get it back if A dies. Possibly a reverter, he can get it back quicker if A breach.

John Rogers: Yes, but A can still be alive. Yes.

doven: Yeah.

John Rogers: Correct? Correct! That is absolutely correct.

John Rogers: Absolutely.

Amir Akbari: 8.

Amir Akbari: And in case, if there is a breach, and it past the time of the statute of limitation for adverse possession.

Amir Akbari: And then, the A can claim for the… Adverse position, right?

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: can.

John Rogers: Can.

John Rogers: Bye.

Amir Akbari: I knew… Right. Is it…

Amir Akbari: Is there something with this, reversion, or no? With the possibility of reverter, or no?

John Rogers: I'm not sure what you're asking.

Amir Akbari: I mean, is it that if something like this happened, what's gonna happen to the reversion?

John Rogers: It's gone, because AO has it now. O, it would then be the fee simple absolute holder, and it's over with. So there's no future interest, because the law grants it back to O again.

Amir Akbari: Got it.

John Rogers: Okay.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: So… Where was I going here?

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: Anytime a determinable estate is conveyed, O will retain a possibility of reverter. Anytime a life estate is conveyed, O will retain a reversion.

John Rogers: So, if you go to my email, That I sent you all.

John Rogers: And it's gonna contain some charts.

John Rogers: One of them is about 93.8% correct.

John Rogers: I could think of situations where it is wrong, but I think it's a pretty good… table on…

John Rogers: How to look at things.

John Rogers: So, it's not perfect. Surprisingly, it's not.

John Rogers: Because everything I do is, but it's not, and I will admit it.

John Rogers: Because I know that you think I'm flawless, but I'm not, okay? One day you'll realize I'm not.

John Rogers: But… Anyhow…

John Rogers: It's a… it's a good way of… of looking about how to kind of, see what someone has when something is being conveyed.

Yessenia Soria: Is it the real property feature interest chart moderately?

Yessenia Soria: No? Huh?

John Rogers: I mean, does it look like a tic-tac-toe?

Yessenia Soria: Yes, it does.

John Rogers: And there you go.

Yessenia Soria: Does reversion, life estate, remainder, contingent, invested.

Yessenia Soria: Possibility of reverter, fee simple or determinable, none. Okay, it's that one.

John Rogers: You got it.

John Rogers: So… There we go. Questions so far?

Mireya Gonzalez: I do, Professor, I have a question. So, when the life of state is obtained, it is then in reversion, and then when

Mireya Gonzalez: It's… The possibility of reverter is applied differently.

Mireya Gonzalez: Like, during the process, versus once it's obtained?

John Rogers: Yes. This… maybe I should come back and explain.

John Rogers: this first. Maybe I should do this first, guys.

John Rogers: Is that okay? If we do these first, and then I just… we come back to this?

Yessenia Soria: Yes.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, I'd like to skip ahead to fees real quick, so just forget this for right now. But, I'll tell you this, okay?

John Rogers: when O… conveys to A for Life.

John Rogers: O presumably has an FSA. A has a present possessory interest in a life estate, with A being the measuring life.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Now, It's not gonna… A is not gonna have it forever, okay?

John Rogers: So, when A dies in this situation, O will retain a reversion, and O will get it in B simple absolute once A dies.

John Rogers: Okay? To future interest. O has a reversion to future interest. Okay?

John Rogers: We are going to skip this for right now, and we are going to go into this tested area, which is big time, okay? So let's do the fee simple determinable. This is different from what I was talking about before, because I was talking about life.

John Rogers: But let's just change it up a bit. So, this is gonna go O2A, So it's a fee.

John Rogers: So, Oak conveys Black Acre 2A, so long as Black Acre is used for residential purposes only, okay?

John Rogers: In this situation, this is nearly identical to,

John Rogers: what I said before, O to A for life. The only difference.

John Rogers: Is that this is in D.

John Rogers: So this means, modernly, This means… that when A dies, This fee's simple, determinable.

John Rogers: that A has.

John Rogers: will go to A's heirs.

John Rogers: And THEY… We'll be subject to.

John Rogers: the residential restriction.

John Rogers: And when they die, They're errors.

John Rogers: will be subject to this residential restriction, and it will go on and on and on until hell freezes over.

doven: Well, this is for fees. So, in this situation, when A dies, it goes to A's ears.

doven: On and on and on.

doven: Very dying.

John Rogers: And ever and ever until the end of time.

gevorg kulikyan: Professor…

Amir Akbari: Condition remains the same.

John Rogers: Same.

Amir Akbari: Conditioned the same, right?

John Rogers: Forever and ever, the condition is there.

John Rogers: Until, or unless… someone… regions.

John Rogers: So, I don't care if someone breaches in 20… 355.

John Rogers: it's gonna go on forever. So, in this situation, you would break it down like O presumably has a fee simple absolute.

John Rogers: A has a B, simple, determinable.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Notice, it's not…

John Rogers: a fee-simple Absolute. It's limited to that. It's almost a fee-simple Absolute, but not quite, because there is a residential use restriction. It confines the use to residential purposes only.

John Rogers: You can't do anything commercial or industrial.

John Rogers: Otherwise, that's a breach.

John Rogers: So… Since there's a possibility that A or A's heirs could breach

John Rogers: and use Blackacre for a Taekwondo studio.

John Rogers: O and O's errors will hold a possibility of reverter, which is a future interest.

John Rogers: So it's like, O conveys to A, there's no B and C. If A breaches, it goes back to O.

John Rogers: Okay? If A continues to abide by it forever and ever until they die, it goes to A's heirs, or whoever A designates.

John Rogers: And then THEY are subject to it.

John Rogers: Forever and ever. And. EVER.

John Rogers: Questions so far?

Yessenia Soria: Question. I know it's gonna sound really stupid, but I'm, like, so lost already. So if O is…

Yessenia Soria: Okay, so let me see if I get this, if I'm even getting it at all.

John Rogers: Stop right there, stop right there, stop right there, stop right there. I would like all 40-something of you

John Rogers: If you're lost, just send me a private message, don't worry, I'm not gonna call ya, I just kinda wanna know, like…

John Rogers: where you're at, where people are at in general. So just send me a private message, okay? Please. Or to text me.

John Rogers: Anyways, sorry to interrupt. Go ahead.

Yessenia Soria: Okay.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, so if O is the owner, Ugh.

Yessenia Soria: Gives the property to A.

Yessenia Soria: It's okay, I'll figure it out.

John Rogers: No, someone said lost AF.

John Rogers: Anyways…

Yessenia Soria: That's me.

Yessenia Soria: Anyways, so if O…

John Rogers: Talking about themselves. Gives it to A.

Yessenia Soria: for life.

Yessenia Soria: So, are we giving… is O giving this to A in life, or is he deceased, and she's one of his…

Yessenia Soria: his.

John Rogers: Who's, who's he and she? I don't know.

Yessenia Soria: O, O, O to A for life, so it's O.

John Rogers: We're on… we're on this.

John Rogers: Okay, but… Oh, yes.

Yessenia Soria: Kim.

John Rogers: Not on this right now. We stopped, and then I was here, and then I stopped, and went to fees instead.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, okay.

John Rogers: Okay, so forget life for right now.

John Rogers: But did you have a question in regards to fees?

Yessenia Soria: No, it's okay, no.

John Rogers: Sure.

John Rogers: Is there anyone else?

Amir Akbari: Can you please explain the last part, the possibility of re-burn?

John Rogers: Well, that's a future interest, but what you need to know about a possibility of reverter.

John Rogers: Just leave class tonight. Go to sleep tonight knowing this about a possibility reverter.

John Rogers: Anytime a be simple determinable is conveyed.

John Rogers: Oh. Will. Always.

John Rogers: By operation of law, hold a possibility of reverter.

John Rogers: That's all I want you to know.

Amir Akbari: Okay, and so it works like a reversion, but…

John Rogers: No.

Amir Akbari: All phrases.

Amir Akbari: Go ahead.

Amir Akbari: But there should be a procedure to come back to the owner based on that procedure or something, right?

John Rogers: Well, yes, it's gonna come back to the original owner, because…

John Rogers: The original owner is the architect.

John Rogers: And that is the individual that is telling what the present and future interest holders can do.

John Rogers: And there has to be some type of remedy if they don't follow it.

John Rogers: And the remedy for this is an automatic forfeiture.

John Rogers: Automatic forfeiture.

John Rogers: So, it automatically forfeits from A. Noticeably, in this example, it doesn't even say that A has to breach.

John Rogers: A could be living in Tokyo, and an adverse possessor could come on the land, and the adverse possessor could start commercially growing marijuana and selling it, and that's a breach.

John Rogers: It's just saying, This property for residential use only.

John Rogers: So, if there's a breach, when a… Be, simple, determinable is conveyed

John Rogers: It automatically forfeits from the grantee and goes back to the original owner, or the owner's heirs.

John Rogers: Now…

John Rogers: A, for… let's just do this one. A has the ability to convey it to someone else. So let's say A conveys it to C, or B, as in boy.

John Rogers: B, must use the property for residential purposes only.

Karen Hernandez: Professor, so will that be the condition, essentially, like, forever, no matter who owns it?

John Rogers: Correct.

Karen Hernandez: Okay.

John Rogers: Correct.

John Rogers: O is the architect. So O is the shot caller.

John Rogers: Now, I'm gonna skip to… this right now.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: And I want you to tell me the difference.

John Rogers: Let me just…

Jude Seleck: reversion is not automatic. All has the right to exercise his,

Jude Seleck: he can revert it back to… I mean, he can take it, or he can just leave it. He can take a blind eye, but it's not automatic.

John Rogers: Boop.

John Rogers: O could be a she.

Jude Seleck: Yeah.

Jude Seleck: Oh.

Jude Seleck: Okay.

John Rogers: Notice here, that this example.

John Rogers: And you're right, that is absolutely correct, you are 100% correct.

John Rogers: Notice this right here. It says, So Long App.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: And notice here, it says, on condition that.

John Rogers: Notice that?

Amir Akbari: It's just for a live.

Amir Akbari: The second one is… the second one is just for a life.

John Rogers: I'm not sure, I'm not following.

Amir Akbari: The second one, like, on condition debt, it means that it's just for the life of the bee.

Amir Akbari: or A.

John Rogers: Well, it's going to be a fee, because it's O2A, modernly. This is iPhone law. O2A, it's a fee.

John Rogers: So this will be a fee, this will operate as a fee.

John Rogers: What kind of fee? There's a fee simple absolute, there's a fee tail, there's a defeasible fee. Well, it looks like a defeasible fee because it's limited. What type of defusible fee?

John Rogers: And then there's 3 types.

John Rogers: Notice the language difference.

John Rogers: What you need to write now.

John Rogers: Know the difference. The second, on condition that

John Rogers: will operate as a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: In fact, The difference, really, Between a fee-simple determinable.

John Rogers: And a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: The difference between the U… the two is the language.

John Rogers: That is used in the conveyance.

John Rogers: So, a determinable… a state?

John Rogers: Is going to incorporate words of duration.

John Rogers: Until… while.

John Rogers: So long as…

John Rogers: The rationale is you can have this

John Rogers: Until the time comes that there's a breach.

John Rogers: And not longer than that.

John Rogers: The fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: Uses more restrictional and contractual language, on condition that, provided that.

John Rogers: So that would be the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. But oftentimes, you can just replace these words back and forth, and it would operate almost the same.

John Rogers: You could use it O to A so long as black egg is used for residential purposes. O to A on condition that. It's the same thing.

John Rogers: But the difference between the conditions subsequent

John Rogers: Is that it does not contain an automatic forfeiture.

John Rogers: Meaning…

John Rogers: If there's a breach, For a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: A does not automatically Forfeit their interest.

John Rogers: instead, O, or O's heirs, may elect… discretionary.

John Rogers: to re-enter Black Acre and take it back.

John Rogers: if… O or O's heirs do not do that.

John Rogers: Then it's presumed that A is fine, no problem.

John Rogers: So… In this instance, O, presumably before the conveyance, would have a B simple absolute.

John Rogers: A… has… You could say a presence, possessory, interest.

John Rogers: In a fee, simple, subject, to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: It's in fee because it's 2A. What kind of fee? It's gonna be defusible because it's limited.

John Rogers: There's a limit on use. Okay, what kind?

John Rogers: of defeasible fee, is it? Well, it's a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. We know that from the restrictional, the contractual type language.

John Rogers: The condition attached.

John Rogers: And O… will retain what? For a million points in the game, O retains a future interest known as…

gevorg kulikyan: Reverter?

John Rogers: I'll give you all a hint. All you have to do is look at that table I sent you guys.

John Rogers: That someone uploaded to the chat. It's right there. Just look to the left.

Marko Danilovski: Right, eventually.

John Rogers: That is correct, it's a right of entry.

John Rogers: Now, that's a future interest.

doven: Answer questions.

doven: So, with fee simple, condition subsequent.

doven: O has, discretion, or O's heirs, they can choose or not to take it back if there's a breach.

John Rogers: Correct!

John Rogers: That is correct.

John Rogers: 100% correct.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, so when they take it back, that's called right of entry?

John Rogers: It's… Allows them to enter and retake it.

John Rogers: There… remember, the right of entry is the right to enter to take it.

Fatima Razavi: So the process is called right of entry.

John Rogers: Yes, well, it's the interest that the future interest holder has.

Fatima Razavi: Got it. Thank you.

John Rogers: Now… The difference here, though, as I said before, is A doesn't have an automatic forfeiture.

John Rogers: It's discretionary.

John Rogers: So… If there's a breach, O or O's errors.

John Rogers: Have to re-enter the property and oust them.

John Rogers: The right to re-enter and retake back

John Rogers: Must be expressly reserved in the conveyance.

John Rogers: Notice here. Once there's a breach.

John Rogers: So, on condition that Blackacre is used for residential purposes. But… Otherwise…

John Rogers: O reserves the right, or O, or O's heirs, reserves the right to enter, re-enter, and take back Blackacre. That is expressly reserving O, or O's heirs right.

John Rogers: To re-enter at any time in the future, until the end of time.

John Rogers: If there's a breach.

John Rogers: Now, The adverse possession lock?

John Rogers: Is not going to kick.

John Rogers: Until that right of entry is exercised.

John Rogers: Because continuous use, even of a breach, is presumed valid.

John Rogers: It's presumed fine.

John Rogers: But you know for sure that it becomes adverse

John Rogers: if O or O's heirs try to re-enter and take back.

John Rogers: Whereas, the determinable estate

John Rogers: It's an automatic forfeiture. It automatically goes back to O. O doesn't have to do anything. O can just be at home eating a hot dog, and all of a sudden has their land back, legally.

John Rogers: What kind of hot dog?

John Rogers: Questions?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yup.

doven: So adverse possession is not going to tick.

doven: I mean, a right of entry is going to… when it's… when O has a right of entry, that's when Everest starts to tick.

John Rogers: when O exercises the right to re-enter. So once O gets off his lazy ass and goes into Blackacre to divest A, that's when the adverse possession clock begins.

John Rogers: And I said lazy ass, and identified him characteristically as a man.

doven: Okay, thank you.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, why would someone even do an FSSCS if it seems so complicated?

John Rogers: Maybe not complicated, because sometimes… A grantor.

John Rogers: may convey something that is, in fact, complicated, and they would agree. And they don't want to punish someone for a breach.

John Rogers: When it can be complicated.

John Rogers: Like, if I want to donate my home, My beloved property to… the LA Unified School District.

John Rogers: On condition that it's… my… my property's only used for school purposes.

John Rogers: What is a school purpose?

John Rogers: Yeah, we're using your property for the children's porta-potties.

John Rogers: Is that a school purpose?

John Rogers: So, what I'm getting at is, sometimes it can be a little complicated, so the intentions of the grantor are not to punish someone in the event of a reach.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Oops.

John Rogers: sometimes there's ambiguity between these two, so sometimes you… it's very hard to determine what O intended.

John Rogers: We will get to that, trust me.

John Rogers: next week, I'm gonna warp your brain.

John Rogers: But for right now, All I want you to know is this.

John Rogers: Words of duration, determinable.

John Rogers: Words of duration are determinable.

John Rogers: O retains a possibility of reverter automatically.

John Rogers: Words, more restrictional, contractual words, like, on condition that, provided that.

John Rogers: blah blah.

John Rogers: R.

John Rogers: Words of a condition subsequent?

John Rogers: There's no automatic forfeiture.

John Rogers: The right of entry is expressly reserved?

John Rogers: An O, or Ozairs, have the right to enter, discretionary, to retake it back later on if there's a breach.

John Rogers: Lots of hands.

Amir Akbari: Can we state the second one is express condition, subsequent, which is, as the…

Amir Akbari: For, for future, Conditions on that?

Amir Akbari: And the first one is, like, like, ambition precedent?

John Rogers: I don't know what you're asking.

Amir Akbari: The second part, the, the one with the condition is, expressed condition, subsequent.

John Rogers: Well, it must be expressed, otherwise how is someone to know to follow it?

Amir Akbari: Yeah, and, it's,

Amir Akbari: It shows the danger of the forfeiture on the interns, and…

John Rogers: Is there a question?

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: So what's the question?

Amir Akbari: No, it's, I think I, connected to the, And…

Amir Akbari: Expressed conditions subsequent in a contract?

Amir Akbari: it looks like… We'll see…

John Rogers: Don't mention contracts here. I'm the only one that can say contracts. You gotta be very careful about mentioning the word contracts. That's a C-O-N class.

John Rogers: I… I say that word with caution, because I can't stand that class.

John Rogers: I… so… I don't know what you are or did learn in contracts, but I don't care.

John Rogers: Let's go to the next student.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Okay, Professor, when you say expressly conveyed, the… the part where it says, reserves the right to enter and retake needs to be expressly conveyed?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Or just the fact that it says O2A on condition.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Is it enough?

John Rogers: Good question. That is a fantastic question.

John Rogers: I did… I may have misspoke when I said expressly conveyed. Expressly reserved.

John Rogers: A problem arises.

John Rogers: When. This.

John Rogers: is not stated.

John Rogers: Jeez, man.

John Rogers: Sometimes this… is not there.

John Rogers: And all we're left is this.

John Rogers: Question… I've never technically seen that before.

John Rogers: If you are given a situation where it's just this only.

John Rogers: Could be a little bit problematic.

John Rogers: but I wouldn't say…

John Rogers: that A has a fee-simple absolute. I think the intentions of the grantor is to create a defusible fee of some sort, and I think the most reasonable response is a fee-simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: I don't think it would be just and equitable to award A with a fee simple absolute.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Would you argue that it would be a fee-simple determinable?

John Rogers: I can't see that.

John Rogers: Because there's no words of duration.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Okay, yeah, conditions.

John Rogers: Evidence owes intentions to to… Have a forfeit the property upon.

John Rogers: A certain time, or when a breach occurs.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Makes sense.

John Rogers: we will… See this again.

John Rogers: So… Note it in your brain. We're gonna see this again.

John Rogers: Okay?

doven: Well, I'm gonna ask a question. O to A on condition of B is used for residential purposes, and that was it.

doven: If, Ave violates the… the breach. It would be difficult for old to get it back.

John Rogers: Well, here's the thing, if it would be difficult or not, it just doesn't seem equitable and just, in my opinion.

John Rogers: If O can't get it back, then that would mean A has just a fee simple absolute. And it just doesn't seem like it was the intentions of the grantor to convey a fee-simple Absolute when there's an attached condition to the conveyance. Limiting use.

John Rogers: But a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent can be written like this. Also, like O2A,

John Rogers: But if Blackacre Is ever used for non-residential use.

John Rogers: Then O reserves the right. Blah blah blah blah. Okay?

John Rogers: We will get, we'll… okay.

John Rogers: Then it could go to something that's otherwise to be.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: This is very advanced for right now.

John Rogers: Very advanced for right now.

John Rogers: But since it got brought up, I'll bring it up, and I'm gonna shoot it down and move on.

John Rogers: O, in this situation, would have a fee simple absolute. A would have… a…

John Rogers: It's actually a fee simple subject to executory limitation.

John Rogers: So I'll get to that now.

John Rogers: We're gonna go into this now.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Oh, sorry, this right here.

John Rogers: Fee simple, subject to executory limitation.

John Rogers: Okay We've discussed fee, simple, determinable. Words of duration.

John Rogers: in feet.

John Rogers: But this is different.

John Rogers: Because… There's a… a B now.

John Rogers: So, it could be this!

John Rogers: Oops.

John Rogers: Oh.

John Rogers: Or, it could be something like this.

John Rogers: Oh.

John Rogers: Word?

John Rogers: It'd be like this.

John Rogers: Something like that.

John Rogers: Notice here.

John Rogers: The language, so long as, on condition that, who cares?

John Rogers: The difference here is that if there is a breach.

John Rogers: It doesn't go back to O.

John Rogers: It goes to B, as in boy.

John Rogers: B's interest B has a… future interest… Future interest… Known as an executory.

John Rogers: interest. This is next week.

John Rogers: future interest. So that's why this the simple…

John Rogers: See that? It's a fee, because it's 2A, modernly.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: It's a feat, right? It's a feat. Modernly. Modern law. iPhone law. It's iPhone law. I love iPhone law.

John Rogers: It's a fee.

John Rogers: What kind of fee? Well, it looks like it's determinable. Oh, yeah, it is! Oh, totally is, right? No.

John Rogers: Because…

John Rogers: it's going to be upon a breed. So it would say, like, and if at any time A uses the property for non-residential purposes, then it would go to B.

John Rogers: So, B's interest would be an executory interest.

John Rogers: Somebody had a question. Why is it BA versus AB?

Fatima Razavi: Yeah, that's me. Why do you write BA and not AV? Is there a reason?

John Rogers: it says it's Black Acre.

Fatima Razavi: Oh, I was thinking it's to A is the owner. Okay, I get it now.

John Rogers: So… .

Fatima Razavi: No, I got it, you're fine.

John Rogers: What was it? Carol was saying. What was I saying?

John Rogers: B? B has it, okay, so it's a… it's a defeasible fee, But it's subject to

John Rogers: B as in boy, taking it.

John Rogers: And in this situation, B has an executoratory interest, which is next week.

John Rogers: that will divest it from A upon breach. So it's not O taking it, it's just… B taking it.

John Rogers: So it's subject to… limitations of B's executive interest.

doven: Can I ask a question?

John Rogers: Yeah.

doven: So, the first two, determinable and subsequent.

doven: that means O has a possibility of taking it or taking it automatically, whereas in executionatory limitation.

doven: O doesn't get… if it's a breach, O doesn't get anything, it goes to B.

John Rogers: Correct.

John Rogers: Correct.

John Rogers: That is correct.

John Rogers: So notice here, the difference for these types of defusible fees.

John Rogers: This one… I'm sorry, here.

John Rogers: Goes back to O upon breach. Goes back to O upon breach.

John Rogers: goes to BE upon breach.

John Rogers: Now, it could be Ralph, or it could be… Patty? It doesn't matter.

John Rogers: But B is just ABC, okay? It's just easier.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: But B would have the same…

Vahe Baghdasaryan: obligation as, A, it could only be residential purposes.

John Rogers: No, because the residential use is only tied to A.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Boring.

John Rogers: his estate. B would get this in V simple absolute.

Karen Hernandez: So you… it would be his for life?

John Rogers: So, it would have to say, otherwise to be, so long as it's used for residential purposes. So, what was your question?

Karen Hernandez: So… If it goes to B, then B can use it however he wants for life.

John Rogers: Oh, shit.

Karen Hernandez: Or she, here.

John Rogers: We have to be ready.

John Rogers: Like, what's your problem? Like, I don't get it.

John Rogers: Sorry, go ahead.

Karen Hernandez: I forgot my question. Oh, if it goes to B, then B can use it however they want for life.

John Rogers: B would have it, and fee simple absolute, under iPhone law.

Karen Hernandez: Okay.

John Rogers: be Simple Absolute Beacon.

John Rogers: Beacon have… commercial boogie night pool parties at B1. Doesn't matter, okay?

John Rogers: They can do whatever they want, there's no conditions attached, there's nothing.

John Rogers: B has it, and fee simple absolute. B can transfer it, sell it, Drill for oil, doesn't matter.

John Rogers: There's no conditions attached, free and clear.

John Rogers: So notice that executory limitation effects… The future interest holder.

John Rogers: Forgot when I was saying.

John Rogers: A fee simple determinable, Is words of duration.

John Rogers: Potentially goes on forever, and ever, and ever, and ever.

John Rogers: Throughout the end of time.

John Rogers: Until… There's a breach.

John Rogers: A fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: can go on.

John Rogers: And on.

John Rogers: And on forever and ever and ever and ever.

John Rogers: Until, or unless.

John Rogers: There's a breach.

John Rogers: In those two estates, It could or will go back to O.

John Rogers: But a fee simple subject to a condition, executor limitation, my apologies.

John Rogers: Could potentially go on forever, and ever, and ever, and ever.

John Rogers: And if there's ever a breach, It won't go to O.

John Rogers: It automatically goes to.

John Rogers: B.

John Rogers: Yes.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: on the condition subsequent, if O… dies.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Do O's heirs have right of entry?

John Rogers: Yes.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Okay.

John Rogers: or whoever O designates. I designate this to my… Best friend's daughter.

John Rogers: Then the best friend's daughter has it.

John Rogers: Then it goes to her heirs, or whoever she designates.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I just want to be specific with the question. Meaning, like, O dies? Does that rise to… like, can the heirs or whoever is…

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Next, can they go and take the property back? Or there still needs to be a breach for the right of entry to be…

John Rogers: There has to be a breach.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Okay, so death isn't automatic. Oh, I can go back and take it.

John Rogers: It goes on forever and ever and ever.

John Rogers: Now… Going back to what we initially started with, which is life.

John Rogers: That's different!

John Rogers: I feel like everyone's, like, thinking to themselves, oh my god.

John Rogers: The difference, though, is the determinable The condition subsequent, and the… Executory limitation.

John Rogers: For the life?

John Rogers: Will not last forever.

John Rogers: Endeavor, and ever. It's… its maximum possession length will…

John Rogers: last for the duration of the grantee's life. So, A's life. It will never go beyond A's life.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, which one is this for?

John Rogers: I'm going back to life estate, determinable life estate, life estate subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: And life estates subject to executor limitation.

John Rogers: Because we just covered feet.

John Rogers: But now we're going back to what I initially stopped at, which was life.

John Rogers: So, in those situations, for a determinable life, And a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: The difference in those is that,

John Rogers: O, potentially, or O's heirs, potentially gets… the property Blackacre.

John Rogers: in one of two ways. Either A dies, Or… There's a breach.

doven: So, with the fees, it's forever and ever, but with life estate, it's just limited to the life.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: Unless you live forever.

John Rogers: Questions?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: I have a question, Professor.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: What's the best way to study this, and understand it, and memorize this?

John Rogers: I think you guys got this perfect! You guys don't need to study this.

John Rogers: It's gonna get worse next week.

John Rogers: We might just do the reading next week.

John Rogers: So the week after, it's gonna get a lot worse, okay?

John Rogers: This is… if you just had a final exam of what we covered tonight, you would be thrilled.

John Rogers: The best way Remember, this is another language.

John Rogers: And… There's only so many ways to test this.

John Rogers: So the best thing that you can do is, one, understand the rule.

John Rogers: And 2?

John Rogers: Just write down as many examples as you can.

John Rogers: The explanations are all the same.

John Rogers: You explain yourself, it's always the same.

John Rogers: There's only so many permutations to this.

John Rogers: So it's like learning another language.

John Rogers: It's just gonna keep… be repetition. What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this?

John Rogers: So… Can't go to this class.

John Rogers: Not putting in work.

John Rogers: And expect to leave this class.

John Rogers: really understanding it.

John Rogers: So you have to do some outside work.

doven: Yeah, I asked a question about fee, life estate fee, executive limitation, so O can get it if there's a breach, or if A dies?

John Rogers: Executor limitation?

doven: Yeah.

John Rogers: Okay, so when, for, for life or feet?

doven: Life Estate.

John Rogers: Okay, so when A dies?

doven: It goes to O.

John Rogers: Okay, so you're saying.

doven: No, no, it goes to B. It goes to B.

John Rogers: Yes.

doven: It goes to bees. But…

John Rogers: You could be very careful. Be very, very, very, very, very careful.

John Rogers: Be very careful. Let me show you why.

John Rogers: You have to really, really look at the language.

John Rogers: That is very, very, very important, and you can get whacked if you don't, okay?

John Rogers: B, simple, subject, do executive levitation.

John Rogers: So… oh, sorry.

John Rogers: Life estate, subject to executory limitation.

John Rogers: So your question was O2A for life.

John Rogers: Let's just say so long as… What?

doven: Residential purpose.

John Rogers: Then what… what do we write here?

doven: Then goes to the B.

doven: Otherwise, go through.

John Rogers: final exam on this, and half the class wanted me fired. So, it's then to be.

doven: Yeah.

John Rogers: oh, this is a problem. And I'll tell you why, okay?

John Rogers: Look at this! I had this on a final exam! This was like a final exam, maybe 2, 3 years ago.

John Rogers: And I didn't notice that I kind of made a mistake until I started reading all the answers.

John Rogers: Pause this example for a second, okay? Pause, and I want to give you Two others, okay?

John Rogers: O2A for life, so, ugh.

John Rogers: So long as Black Acre is used, ugh!

John Rogers: Residential purposes, But, if not used for residential purposes, than to be.

John Rogers: Or…

John Rogers: This is the confusing part.

John Rogers: And we're gonna take a break, and… 8 o'clock.

John Rogers: It's O to A so long as A…

John Rogers: uses Blackacre as used for residential purposes. That is identical to this, okay? But there are… there's a bit of a difference about how B gets it.

John Rogers: So… But if not used for residential purposes, then it goes to B.

John Rogers: Whereas this situation is, it doesn't matter if there's a breach or not, it's when A dies, it goes to B.

doven: Well, open.

John Rogers: So, then to be is problematic, because it doesn't really specify if it's upon the death of A it goes to B, or it's upon breach it goes to B.

doven: Oh, okay.

John Rogers: That was a big problem, so I just…

doven: I just awarded points that, you know, whoever just gave me some type of coherent answer, and there you go.

John Rogers: So that's a little bit problematic.

John Rogers: I think then-to-be would probably incorporate Both?

John Rogers: In a way.

John Rogers: And that's what was problematic.

John Rogers: But since you guys seem so interested, and you guys seem so on top of it, I almost feel like we don't need a break.

John Rogers: No, I need a break myself.

John Rogers: So it'll take 15 minutes, okay?

Fatima Razavi: Professor, can I ask you a question?

John Rogers: Sure.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, so we went through the fee simple, subject to condition, subsequent, fee, simple, determinal. You said those are forever?

John Rogers: Potentially lasting forever. A fee?

John Rogers: Can potentially last forever and ever and ever.

Fatima Razavi: What happens when B dies?

John Rogers: In what situation?

Fatima Razavi: Peace, simple, determinable.

John Rogers: B as in boy, well, then that would be a fee simple subject to executory limitation. So then it would go to B upon breach?

Fatima Razavi: And if B dies, then what happens?

John Rogers: Okay. Well, assuming B has it in phi simple absolute.

John Rogers: It would then filter to these errors.

Fatima Razavi: And that would be stated?

John Rogers: it would just say otherwise to B, and if B dies, it goes to B's errors, and then theirs, and then their errors.

Fatima Razavi: But it will say it's going to be given to B's heirs. It will state that, or just say it will be given to B because it's modern.

John Rogers: Like I said, I'm an iPhone law person.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, so then smarter.

John Rogers: So, it would just say, to be.

Fatima Razavi: To be… and then you'd automatically assume it goes to their heirs.

John Rogers: Or whomever B would designate as their beneficiary, his or her beneficiary.

Fatima Razavi: Got it. But then for life estate, it would go back to… oh.

John Rogers: it would go back to O.

Fatima Razavi: That is correct. Thank you.

John Rogers: reversion.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, thank you.

doven: Let me ask… can I ask a question about the life of state for executive limitation? Yes.

doven: So when, A dies, then it goes… A, O to A, A dies.

doven: What if he don't preach? I mean…

doven: 8… it goes to B, it goes to B.

John Rogers: Say it again, so it's a life estate subject to executor limitation, is that what it is?

doven: Yes.

John Rogers: Okay? If A dies, it's not gonna go to B. It will go back to O.

doven: Roberto.

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: Oh, I'm sorry, executor limitation, as long as…

John Rogers: That's a bit tricky.

John Rogers: the executor interest that B would have would only take it from A upon a breach.

John Rogers: But if someone is getting the property upon the death of… of… A… It's not an executor interest.

John Rogers: It will be a vested remainder, and I just haven't… we're gonna get into that.

doven: Prayer, thank you.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Mireya Gonzalez: Professor, I do have a question as far as… I don't know if I'm jumping ahead a little, but as far as the questions that you provided us.

Mireya Gonzalez: I'm in the beginning of the…

Mireya Gonzalez: of the year, or not of the year, but you know what I mean. Will we be going over those in class with you, by any chance, or is that something we do on our own?

John Rogers: questions.

Mireya Gonzalez: They're, like, the essay, looking questions.

Mireya Gonzalez: What?

John Rogers: Are they looking?

Mireya Gonzalez: Well, it is. Yes.

John Rogers: SA-looking? What does that mean?

Mireya Gonzalez: Well, it looks like an essay.

John Rogers: Okay, so it's a question…

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes.

John Rogers: Okay, yeah, we will be going over a lot.

John Rogers: of them.

John Rogers: I would probably say we'll go over, like, 10.

John Rogers: Yeah, we'll go over, like, 10.

John Rogers: You can't do any of them now.

John Rogers: I will send an essay out of an adverse possession question, if you guys just want to give it a shot, go ahead, and you can…

John Rogers: You can give it a shot and try to… try to do it.

John Rogers: But I don't think that you can do any of the questions right now.

John Rogers: 50% of them

John Rogers: you'll be able to do, like, the last couple weeks of class. It's landlord-tenant, so it's not too hard, but I try to make it tricky.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

John Rogers: Just a heads up.

John Rogers: like I said before, this class is gonna start snowballing, so it's gonna start getting worse and worse and worse, okay?

John Rogers: So make sure you're keeping up with it, okay?

John Rogers: And if you don't want to be friends with me, totally fine.

John Rogers: We can just be strangers, but look, I'm giving you a friendly hand if you need any help, okay?

John Rogers: We can be friends.

John Rogers: Questions at all from what we have covered right now?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, going back.

John Rogers: O is conveying something to A.

John Rogers: Is it a fee? Is it a life?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Anytime someone something gets something. Also, what are they getting? Are they getting something in fee or life?

John Rogers: And then we're adding blocks to it. Okay, well, what kind of interest do they have?

John Rogers: Are they breaching this interest?

John Rogers: Did they complete this interest?

John Rogers: What's going on?

John Rogers: So that's a really… Good way of looking at things.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Now, there are two concepts that we are going to be going over.

John Rogers: I can't recall in my notes… Which one goes first?

John Rogers: But there's two that I want to talk about, and that is the doctrine of waste.

John Rogers: and… Restraint on alienation.

John Rogers: Could one of the kind, friendly souls in the Matrix universe tell me which one goes first? And I have a feeling it's waste.

Clarissa Terrazas: restraint.

Deanna Khachatrian: Oh.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Restraint is not a type of an estate.

John Rogers: It's kind of like a… If the grantor puts something down.

John Rogers: That could potentially be deemed unlawful.

John Rogers: Like, a restraint.

John Rogers: then… The grantees, or whomever has standing to sue, can move to strike.

John Rogers: a certain provision?

John Rogers: in the conveyance?

John Rogers: as being… I'm awful.

doven: Yes.

doven: Is there unlawful, if it's unlawful?

John Rogers: Yeah, unlawful.

John Rogers: An unlawful restraint.

John Rogers: Restraint on alienation. Land is freely alienable, meaning you can transfer it, you can sell it, you can gift it.

John Rogers: And the law allows that. It wants that, because the more times that title passes, potential, more taxes for the IRS.

John Rogers: And we all love the IRS.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: The answer is no.

John Rogers: We don't love the IRS.

John Rogers: But okay.

John Rogers: That's why, like, in March.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I got my taxes, they really don't like the IRS.

John Rogers: Usually in March, I get really mad.

John Rogers: So if you make the mistake of taking me next semester.

John Rogers: I'm gonna be real mad in that month.

John Rogers: Means I have to start paying some money.

John Rogers: And I'm not happy.

John Rogers: Beware.

John Rogers: Now… The grantee, the… oh, the architect.

John Rogers: has the ability to create interest. I want this to go to this person, then this person, this person for life, on condition that this.

John Rogers: But there might be a condition.

John Rogers: that… precludes… the sale… Transfer, or even mortgage?

John Rogers: Property.

John Rogers: For example, O to A!

John Rogers: So long as Black Acre is used for residential purposes. Have you guys seen that before?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yep.

John Rogers: Yes, you have? Okay, correct. And…

John Rogers: that A and A's heirs never sell Black Acre.

John Rogers: Otherwise to be.

John Rogers: Or just, you know, but it doesn't have to say otherwise to be, you could just say period, but whatever.

John Rogers: Period.

John Rogers: So, notice here, That there is a provision in this section here.

John Rogers: of AND that Blackacre is never sold.

John Rogers: That is what we are examining when we are looking at restraints.

John Rogers: Now, restraints aren't just never tested.

John Rogers: They are tested, like, every semester, it's tested a lot.

John Rogers: Like, a lot, a lot, a lot. It's also tested on the bar a lot. It's been tested twice in the past 15 years.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: And restraints are typically… Tested in tandem with present interests of what we just learned!

John Rogers: And it…

John Rogers: Withholds the power, it's a section in the conveyance that withholds the power of selling or transferring or even mortgaging property.

John Rogers: So your job is to, one, spot if there is a restraint.

John Rogers: On the grantee from selling or transferring property.

John Rogers: And identify that restraint.

John Rogers: The next part of the analysis… there's 3 types.

John Rogers: I don't care very much about going over all three. I think that they are self-explanatory. If you know how to read left to right, I think you'll figure it out.

John Rogers: But…

John Rogers: The next part of the analysis, for a restraint, is to determine If it's valid or invalid.

John Rogers: Is this a valid restraint? Is this restraint invalid?

John Rogers: There's no formal rule for it.

John Rogers: It's measured on a case-by-case basis.

John Rogers: And you want to look for a few things.

John Rogers: how long… is the restraint.

John Rogers: 4.

John Rogers: Is it 5 years?

John Rogers: Someone's lifetime? 20 years? Or forever and ever and ever until the end of time?

John Rogers: So, if it's a… Restraint that lasts forever and ever, it's probably not going to be valid.

John Rogers: It restricts the marketability of the property.

John Rogers: What is the intentions?

John Rogers: behind the restraint. Why is there a restraint?

John Rogers: What is the intentions for this restraint?

John Rogers: Is it limited in duration?

John Rogers: For example, If I convey property to you.

John Rogers: that you must use this for residential purposes only, and you cannot sell this land for the next 30 years, because I want to make sure that the rabbit population survives, because they are going extinct in this area.

John Rogers: So, the purpose is to preserve the wildlife.

John Rogers: Is that restraint

John Rogers: Forever? It's for 30 years. So, is that… A significant amount of time?

John Rogers: Well, it's limited, it's 30 years. I mean, it is a long time, but…

John Rogers: There's good faith intentions behind it, because it's to preserve wildlife.

John Rogers: And it's certainly not necessarily trying to

John Rogers: There's good faith intentions behind it.

John Rogers: to maybe… That could be upheld.

John Rogers: Maybe that could be valid.

John Rogers: But from what I have that's pixelated on your screen.

John Rogers: we don't know the intentions of the grantor. We don't know why O said, Blackacre is never sold.

John Rogers: We don't know why.

John Rogers: Can we ever find out? Maybe. Someone text message O and let me know what O says back to you.

John Rogers: We're never gonna know what O's intentions were behind it. They're not explained.

John Rogers: O doesn't say, in effort to keep this within the family to ensure our heritage and blah blah blah blah blah, I don't ever want you to sell this.

John Rogers: then we can figure it out. But in this instance, from what I see here, we don't know. It's just to punish someone.

John Rogers: It's to penalize someone.

John Rogers: There's no explanation that we can assess to determine if it's valid.

John Rogers: It's just a blanket restraint with no explanation to assess for whether or not it's wrong.

John Rogers: Reasonable.

John Rogers: And because of that, What's the remedy?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: The restraint is void.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: So what you actually do, Is in the real world, you go to the local

John Rogers: School supply store, and you buy a pencil.

John Rogers: Who uses pencils? Does anyone know who still uses a pencil? Who does? Does anybody know?

John Rogers: Is anyone using a pencil right now?

Fatima Razavi: I, as a counsel.

Mireya Gonzalez: You use a pencil? I also…

Fatima Razavi: Yeah.

Mireya Gonzalez: insult.

John Rogers: I'm just so… I mean.

Fatima Razavi: I also have a 7-year-old son that I have to show him how to use a pencil, so yes.

John Rogers: I'm wondering if you actually have a pencil sharpener?

Fatima Razavi: I have everything.

John Rogers: Wild.

John Rogers: You know, my counterpart that I teach evidence with, Peter Sebastian, uses a pencil.

John Rogers: He even told me a couple years ago, he's like, can't even sharpen my pets, they don't have sharpeners at school anymore. I'm like, what?

John Rogers: Dude, you need to… you need to go back to 1983, dude.

John Rogers: Anyways, so you go get your pencil.

John Rogers: And you take your pencil, and you cross out the section that contains stuff.

John Rogers: The restriction, and you void it, and read it as if it doesn't exist.

John Rogers: That's a restraint.

John Rogers: 30%, 25% of the essay questions

John Rogers: that I gave you contained restraints.

John Rogers: Said, what's a pencil?

John Rogers: Right.

John Rogers: Question.

gevorg kulikyan: Yes, Professor. So, in this situation, once the restraint goes away, upon breach, Does the…

gevorg kulikyan: property still go to… does Blackacre still go to B?

John Rogers: Well, the only way in this situation it would go to be is if It's used.

John Rogers: For non-residential purposes.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, so the…

John Rogers: This never sold, so if A sells it to C, that's fine. It's an invalid restraint.

John Rogers: It's invalid.

gevorg kulikyan: Hmm.

John Rogers: It's crossed out.

gevorg kulikyan: So if C uses it for non-residential purposes, it would go to B.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: Okay. Beautiful. You're melting my heart.

gevorg kulikyan: Thank you, thank you.

doven: Can I ask the question, is this life estate, or is this fee?

John Rogers: Well, as I said before, I'm more of an iPhone law.

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: I like to apply the state of the law that existed when iPhones were around.

John Rogers: There are some people that are actually listening to me right now that don't understand that concept because they were born when iPhones were already in existence.

doven: Wild!

John Rogers: Anyways…

doven: I apply modern law.

doven: So, for the question… the question is…

doven: If that restraint, don't show the purpose. It's never so, so you can just cross it out.

John Rogers: Yes, but you want to… really…

John Rogers: Get into more of a discussion of, we don't really know.

John Rogers: We can't assess its reasonableness. We don't know its intentions.

John Rogers: And it just… it's a blanket restraint that withholds

John Rogers: In essence, the marketability of Blackacre.

John Rogers: It's gonna be invalid.

John Rogers: And it's… indefinite in duration. It's not limited in duration. It's not 10 years, 20 years.

John Rogers: So it's likely… Going to be invalid.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: and raised.

gevorg kulikyan: One more question, Professor. If the support person…

John Rogers: One more? One more?

gevorg kulikyan: One more right now.

John Rogers: Right, okay.

gevorg kulikyan: So if a… even if a restraint has… the intention is stated, but it's not a reasonable intention.

gevorg kulikyan: Will the restraint still be valid?

John Rogers: What's a reasonable one? Well, what is that? Give me an example.

gevorg kulikyan: So… Black Acre can't be sold because… something racist. I don't know.

John Rogers: But can't be given to Eskimos.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah.

gevorg kulikyan: Something like that.

gevorg kulikyan: But the intention is clearly stated, that O does not want.

John Rogers: Blackacre to ever be sold.

gevorg kulikyan: But it's not a reasonable… Intention that they have.

John Rogers: I don't think that that's lawful, either.

John Rogers: To restrict on race.

John Rogers: gender, national origin.

gevorg kulikyan: Hmm.

John Rogers: That would be discriminatory.

John Rogers: Yeah, I could definitely see that, for sure.

John Rogers: it's not reasonable. The intentions behind it were not lawful, it's discriminatory, and it's not reasonable. Sure, I love it.

gevorg kulikyan: So, even if… Let's say they had an unreasonable, lawful intention.

John Rogers: I can't think of one right now, but the reasonable, lawful intention, an unreasonable, lawful, lawful.

gevorg kulikyan: Yes. Like, their intention isn't illegal.

gevorg kulikyan: It's not discriminatory, but…

John Rogers: So, you can't sell it unless you take real property fall semester 10 times and get an A-plus 10 times?

gevorg kulikyan: That sounds unreasonable.

John Rogers: Yeah.

gevorg kulikyan: But it's legal.

John Rogers: Because who can get an A-plus?

John Rogers: I've given an A+.

gevorg kulikyan: There we go, so it's reasonable.

John Rogers: God.

gevorg kulikyan: If someone's done it, it's not impossible.

John Rogers: And they were a damn handwriter. They wrote, hand-wrote their final exam under timed conditions.

John Rogers: There was nothing I could do.

John Rogers: Shit.

gevorg kulikyan: There you go.

John Rogers: Anyways, I guess that's so… Extraneous to the land.

John Rogers: of what does getting an A plus 10 times in real property have anything to do with…

John Rogers: It just seems more about punishing.

John Rogers: I just don't see it being reasonable.

John Rogers: But interesting. That's an interesting question. I never… I've never thought of that before.

gevorg kulikyan: I just wanted to see if it's, like, black and white. If the intention is stated, the restraint

gevorg kulikyan: is valid. And if it's not stated, then it's invalid.

gevorg kulikyan: Like, I wanted to know if it's possible for the intention to be stated, and the restraint to be invalid.

gevorg kulikyan: If that makes sense.

John Rogers: restated in the recipient. Yeah.

John Rogers: To make sure that my children are cared for for their lives, this property could never be sold forever.

John Rogers: Well, hold on.

John Rogers: You had good faith intentions, because you want to make sure that your children have a place to stay, and they don't sleep in the streets.

gevorg kulikyan: The third day.

John Rogers: But it's not limited to their life, it's limited indefinitely.

John Rogers: So, when your generations of grandchildren, grandchildrens, and grandchildrens are in flying cars and teleporting.

John Rogers: They can't sell it either?

gevorg kulikyan: Got it.

gevorg kulikyan: So the intention needs to be reasonable for the restraints to be valid.

John Rogers: Whoa.

John Rogers: I don't think one outweighs the other. I think it's just a general assessment. It's kind of a…

John Rogers: Collectively, is it reasonable?

gevorg kulikyan: Like, the restraint and the intention coupled together need to be reasonable.

John Rogers: Well, you assess its reasonableness based on what the intentions are.

John Rogers: Is it limited on duration? Etc, et cetera.

gevorg kulikyan: Got it.

John Rogers: You gonna get an A-plus?

gevorg kulikyan: We'll see.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Questions?

John Rogers: This comes up a lot.

John Rogers: I'm gonna bust you up big time.

John Rogers: I will.

John Rogers: You're gonna miss it.

John Rogers: Make sure you know it.

John Rogers: It's there, and I'm GOING to put it in some future examples.

John Rogers: I will get… put it in future examples. It comes up all the time, it's like a rabbit hole.

John Rogers: We are actually gonna have a case on it next week. It's the gray case.

John Rogers: Which you all know about.

John Rogers: I'm not gonna do it tonight.

John Rogers: Because I'm more of a proponent of lecturing, Then, let's attack.

John Rogers: the casebook.

John Rogers: I don't think it's beneficial to do both concurrently, in a way.

John Rogers: Questions.

Amir Akbari: If the condition is indefinite, and but it's reasonable, not reasonable, it's on the good faith.

Amir Akbari: Like, like the example you said, he wanna keep, her family until the end at the home, and he…

Amir Akbari: He doesn't want to… you know…

Amir Akbari: Her family's still that home, right?

Amir Akbari: There is the… good faith over here, right? Is it reasonable, or…

Amir Akbari: But it's indefinite.

John Rogers: Well, I think there was good faith I want to provide for my children.

Amir Akbari: Yep.

John Rogers: I made the mistake of bringing them in this world, I gotta provide for them, so I need to make sure that they're not living in the street. The problem is, is that…

John Rogers: No one laughed.

John Rogers: The problem is that it's not limited in duration, it's forever.

Amir Akbari: We lodged this DNA.

Amir Akbari: He wants to continue, on that situation, you know?

Amir Akbari: He doesn't want to.

Amir Akbari: Have a, like, future grandchild without that.

John Rogers: okay, but I'd still say that that precludes it.

John Rogers: Forever and ever. I still want to provide for my entire, family.

John Rogers: So it should never be sold.

John Rogers: That's tough.

Amir Akbari: So, but, we can take it out, right, with this restraint.

John Rogers: Here's the thing.

John Rogers: I can't necessarily say that you're wrong or right.

John Rogers: What's the problem?

John Rogers: That's the.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, but… but the sign is indefinite, right? If there is indefinite, and it's forever…

John Rogers: It's just meaning forever and ever and ever and ever, this could never be sold, ever.

John Rogers: Ever! Till the end of time.

John Rogers: It's like, well, we…

Amir Akbari: not reasonable.

John Rogers: How is that reasonable? I don't want this property sold for 122 years. Maybe that could be upheld for legitimate, good faith.

John Rogers: Reasons? Who knows? But forever and ever and ever and ever and EVER!

John Rogers: Unlikely.

John Rogers: until the Great Pyramids disintegrate, And they were just…

John Rogers: Maybe we could find them in some historical texts?

John Rogers: But now they're just withered away in sand.

John Rogers: That's when you can sell it.

John Rogers: Restraint on alienation is not in a type of a state.

John Rogers: when you look at all the questions, many of the interrogatories on final exams and the questions that I sent you, or should I say the

John Rogers: files that I sent that look like essays.

John Rogers: many of the interrogatories say, what are the validity of those interests? So there'll be a deed, and it will say, what interests were created by John's 2025 deed.

John Rogers: The next interrogatory will say, what are the validity of those interests?

John Rogers: to save.

John Rogers: Pixels on a screen.

John Rogers: Sometimes I just put what interests were created by John's 2025 deed, and what are the validity of those interests.

John Rogers: The validity is where restraints come in.

John Rogers: But I would still stock… talk about it, even if it doesn't say validity.

John Rogers: Obviously, you want to determine, is this valid?

John Rogers: Is this legit?

John Rogers: Because someone is going to sell it. It's going to be sold!

John Rogers: On the bar exam.

John Rogers: What stuck up? It was O2A,

John Rogers: But if A or A's heirs ever sell, transfer, gift, mortgage, black acre to any third person, then it goes to B.

John Rogers: No. Then it goes back to O, sorry.

John Rogers: So, the fee's simple, subject to a condition subsequent, a right of re-entry, but the whole thing was contingent upon a restraint, which the whole thing was invalid.

John Rogers: Which means that A had a fee simple absolute.

John Rogers: let me.

John Rogers: Give you the example.

John Rogers: I think it's, arguable here. I disagree with it, but whatever.

John Rogers: It went something like this, and it's more fluffy, but, this is how it went.

John Rogers: O2A. Comma.

John Rogers: But if Blackacre is ever sold.

John Rogers: Sold. Gifted.

John Rogers: transferred.

John Rogers: Ugh.

John Rogers: Ugh.

John Rogers: Transfers, sold, gifted, transferred, conveyed to… or mortgage, conveyed, or mortgage.

John Rogers: To any third, any person, any other person.

John Rogers: then, oh… Reserves the right to enter, blah blah blah.

John Rogers: Here's the thing.

John Rogers: A fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: A fee simple determinable, for example, what we went over. Life estate determinable, doesn't matter.

John Rogers: Are contingent upon use.

John Rogers: Of the property.

John Rogers: This is not anything about using the property, which…

John Rogers: That's why I have an issue.

John Rogers: Nonetheless… Bar exam purposes, you'd really want to analyze it like this.

John Rogers: O presumably has a fee simple absolute, okay?

John Rogers: A? Has what? What do you guys think?

John Rogers: Well, first off, does A have a fee or a life?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: B.

gevorg kulikyan: E.

John Rogers: Okay, what kind of fee? There's 3 types.

John Rogers: What kind of fee is it?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Simple.

John Rogers: be simple, but… Absolutely.

John Rogers: So, A has a phi simple absolute.

John Rogers: A can do whatever A wants with it?

Karen Hernandez: No, he has a defusible.

John Rogers: Hold on! How does… hold on! A could be, like, Alice.

John Rogers: Ashley, Alejandra!

John Rogers: What makes you think A is a he? But anyways, keep going.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: The feasible fee.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Kind of.

John Rogers: feasible fee.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: The condition subsequent?

John Rogers: Correct.

John Rogers: A has a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: O has what?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Future interest?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Right of entry?

John Rogers: Correct. Future interest, right of entry.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: You've determined what everybody has, let's look at the validity.

John Rogers: So, I would bring up a restraint.

John Rogers: So I would want to look at the validity of this, but if blackcakeeper is ever sold, gifted, transferred, conveyed, or mortgaged to any other person, that is indefinitely.

John Rogers: Forever and ever and ever.

John Rogers: Because it says 2A, but if Blackacre is ever. It doesn't say if A ever.

John Rogers: It just says, if Blackacre is ever sold, But it doesn't say.

John Rogers: If A ever sells.

John Rogers: or transfers.

John Rogers: So that goes on forever and ever and ever.

John Rogers: Until the universe finally collapses on itself.

John Rogers: It explodes again.

doven: So, with this, it didn't say Black Hikers ever, so it, you know, it doesn't say A, if A ever sells it, Black Hikers.

John Rogers: if A never… it's so… this… Restraint.

John Rogers: follows this property forever and ever and ever, because it doesn't say if A ever sold.

John Rogers: That would mean that it only attaches to A's life.

John Rogers: Because it's A.

John Rogers: But this is at Blackacre as ever.

John Rogers: So we don't know the intentions why.

John Rogers: We don't know the reasons behind it to assess it for reasonableness. It's a blanket restraint that completely withheld the marketability of Blackacre.

John Rogers: It's gonna be invalid!

John Rogers: invalid.

John Rogers: So, what do you do?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: you cross out everything after 2A.

John Rogers: Yes, so see this, then O reserves the right? So that is only…

John Rogers: to occur if there's a breach.

John Rogers: So this is contingent upon the breach, so everything gets crossed out. So guess what? What does A have?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Phi simple absolute.

John Rogers: It has a fee, simple, absolute.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: When we bring up the restraint, do we have to specify, the type? Like, on the notes, we have types of restraints.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: do we…

John Rogers: Sure.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: You know what?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Which type would this be?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Understood.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: disabling?

John Rogers: You guys tell me.

John Rogers: Is it written down? Did I write it down?

John Rogers: I think I wrote it down.

John Rogers: And you know what, I think I even gave you guys examples.

John Rogers: Sometimes they're hand raised.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, Professor, so, when you said that.

gevorg kulikyan: So it's O to A, but if Blackacre is ever sold, That's… How can it be sold?

gevorg kulikyan: if a… has possession, or A's heirs have possession of it. Who else could sell it?

John Rogers: Well, once A dies.

John Rogers: A's errors take over, and this attaches to A's errors. Then it attaches to their errors, and their errors, and their errors.

John Rogers: So this is not limited to A only. It's whoever is within A's estate that's A's successor as well.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, so the restraint is forever.

John Rogers: Forever and ever and ever.

gevorg kulikyan: And that's why it would be invalid.

John Rogers: Yes. If it said A only, I still think it would be invalid.

John Rogers: still within A's life, there's no reason for it. We don't have an explanation for it.

John Rogers: No idea. I'd still think it'd be invalid.

gevorg kulikyan: Got it.

John Rogers: That is restraint on alienation. This comes up a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot, lot, lot, lot, lot. This was a bar exam question 14 years ago.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So…

doven: And this is called Restraint on Alienation.

John Rogers: Correct. Restraints.

John Rogers: Now, I want to speak for 15 minutes on another type of doctrine And that is… The doctrine of…

John Rogers: Waste.

John Rogers: The doctrine of waste.

John Rogers: The doctrine of waste is not like an estate. It's not a type of interest that we have learned tonight.

John Rogers: But it's kind of a remedy that a future interest holder can assert.

John Rogers: For example, O to A for life, then to B.

John Rogers: So let me get this. So… Grandma… Gives it to Mom.

John Rogers: for life.

John Rogers: Then… to you.

John Rogers: Forever and ever and ever in fee simple absolute, okay?

John Rogers: So it's good ol' grandma, to mom, to you.

John Rogers: Mom only has it for her life.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Should I slow down?

John Rogers: No, wait, slow down! Slow down! I need to know, like, what, like, what…

John Rogers: What's going on with Mom? Like, what's her name? A?

John Rogers: O to A for life, then to B.

John Rogers: There's Grandma, Mom, and you.

John Rogers: Grandma?

John Rogers: is dead.

John Rogers: Dead.

John Rogers: Died in her sleep.

John Rogers: Maybe she got killed? Who knows?

John Rogers: Mom has it now.

John Rogers: Now, we love Mom.

John Rogers: Most of us.

John Rogers: What happens?

John Rogers: if mom starts… Screwing the property up.

John Rogers: It's this beautiful…

John Rogers: Really nice house. Oh, Black Acre is just a really nice house. Where's the house, guys? Where's the house?

Sennett Devermont: Newport.

John Rogers: Alright, it's in Newport. It's a really nice house in Newport.

John Rogers: Mom.

John Rogers: is not… Keeping up with the property.

John Rogers: She's kind of partying a lot.

John Rogers: The foundation's screwing up.

John Rogers: There's weeds everywhere.

John Rogers: There's, like, a smell of dead bodies coming from the…

John Rogers: Garage, but it's really not a dead body, who knows what it is.

John Rogers: It's really becoming dilapidated.

John Rogers: Would you be happy about that?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: No.

John Rogers: Why?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Because I have a future interest in the house.

John Rogers: When mom dies, you get it.

John Rogers: And you're gonna be getting this property with problems.

John Rogers: It's going to waste.

John Rogers: So, there are different types of waste.

John Rogers: there's… What? Can anyone tell me?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Affirmative waste.

John Rogers: Which is what? Is that intentional?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Intends to damage the land permanently.

John Rogers: That's a problem.

John Rogers: intending to damage.

John Rogers: The other one is what?

John Rogers: Negligent?

John Rogers: The omissions of upkeeping the property?

John Rogers: That's a problem, too. Mom, what are you doing?

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: And the third.

John Rogers: is changing the character.

John Rogers: of the property.

John Rogers: So, mom… Has this great idea.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: This is a cool house in Newport.

John Rogers: It's right near the water.

John Rogers: outside any war zones, next to some really cool restaurants, you get that ocean breeze. It's not 104 like Woodland Hills, like where I was yesterday.

John Rogers: And…

John Rogers: Mom.

John Rogers: Has this idea where she just loves clowns.

John Rogers: Your mom, she loves clowns, and she wants to have a clown circus. She wants to demolish this house, and open up this, like, mini circus with clowns, because she loves clowns.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So mom opens up this little circus.

John Rogers: It's now commercial.

John Rogers: And there's clowns, no one goes by the house, surprisingly. I don't know why.

John Rogers: Thought clowns were funny.

John Rogers: Anyways… She puts in a lot of effort, expenses, into making this kind of circus.

John Rogers: Mom dies.

John Rogers: Police discover it's not murder, But she dies.

John Rogers: And you are cleared.

John Rogers: You get the property now, right?

John Rogers: what was originally A home in Newport, with that nice ocean breeze.

John Rogers: Whatever.

John Rogers: Now, it's a circus?

John Rogers: And you… Have to manage it? You're the property owner now?

John Rogers: Wait a minute.

John Rogers: This is far.

John Rogers: Beyond what was contemplated, and outside of what the intentions were of the grantor.

John Rogers: Plus.

John Rogers: you are hurting the future interest holder. Me, the son or daughter of mom.

John Rogers: Because now I have to now worry about a business, Taxes, all kinds of responsibilities.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: it's…

John Rogers: Mom.

John Rogers: Is changing the character.

John Rogers: Of the property.

John Rogers: Notice that?

John Rogers: ameliative waste.

John Rogers: But that's just not fair to you, right?

John Rogers: Three types of waste.

John Rogers: So, what can happen Is that, What can happen?

John Rogers: Is that the future interest holder could… Sue for damages?

John Rogers: Seek an injunction?

John Rogers: To stop the activity?

John Rogers: Or, and I… believe…

John Rogers: I'm not sure, but I don't believe the future interest holder can step in and divest the present interest holder, but maybe. That's a pretty good research assignment for someone in this class.

John Rogers: I'd like to know.

John Rogers: Someone has her hand raised.

Avi Omrany: Yeah, I had a question. So, for, I suck at pronouncing the word… ameliorative waste?

Avi Omrany: If you change, the… what the…

Avi Omrany: what it is, even though it increases the value of the property, how do you know what you can and can't do? Like, let's say you want to remodel the bathroom. How do you know if you're not going to get sued for amelior to waste or not?

John Rogers: Well, that's different, because if you change the bathroom, it's still nature and characteristic of the property, I would assume, is still residential, right?

Avi Omrany: Mmm.

John Rogers: So, I mean, think of it kind of like changing it from residential to commercial.

John Rogers: Commercial to industrial.

John Rogers: Stuff like that.

Avi Omrany: Okay, and then if…

Avi Omrany: let's say… and I don't want to ask, like, hyper-specific ones, but let's say something, for example, like, it's just an old, rustic house.

Avi Omrany: And it has that, like, I don't know, eclectic vibe of the house, and you make it more modern. So, you know, if someone…

John Rogers: calls the house, Mediterranean style, and you change it to cottagecore? Would that be changing the type of… What is cottagecore? What is that?

Avi Omrany: Cottagecore is, like, the barn-style houses, you know, the white houses, triangle roof, got the columns…

Avi Omrany: Live, laugh, love on the wall.

John Rogers: What!

Avi Omrany: Yeah, that's cottagecore.

John Rogers: Live, laugh, love on the wall?

Avi Omrany: Live, laugh, love on the wall. You know, a picture says a thousand words. Vahe's laughing, he knows what I'm talking about.

John Rogers: I don't… I've never heard of that type of property.

John Rogers: Anyways… Good question.

John Rogers: It's… The… is the interest of the future interest holder?

John Rogers: Prejudiced in any way.

John Rogers: unrepairable.

John Rogers: Too burdensome.

John Rogers: I don't think in that situation.

John Rogers: I don't think so.

John Rogers: Plus, it's, I don't think… I think that's strictly cosmetic.

John Rogers: In a way.

John Rogers: I think I know what I'm talking about.

John Rogers: But, I don't see that being a problem.

Avi Omrany: Okay.

Avi Omrany: Perfect, thank you.

John Rogers: I mean, I'd be thinking, like, taking the Newport Beach house and turning it into a junkyard.

John Rogers: Lots of hands raised.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Go ahead, Doug.

doven: Okay.

doven: So there's two ways that the future interest holder can…

doven: You know, legally to do something, is it super damages an injunction to start… an injunction to stop the activity?

doven: Or is it more?

John Rogers: No, there's three. There's probably more, but what we learn in this universe is 3.

John Rogers: I used to teach it for just any interest holder. I'm gravitating more towards interest holders that are nearly guaranteed to get it, that follow life estates.

John Rogers: unlikely to follow a fee, because, like, A, on a fee-simple determinable, could have it, their estate, forever and ever and ever. It may never go to B.

John Rogers: So it's applicable to life estates.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Obviously, they would have to step in before A dies.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: They don't have any…

Vahe Baghdasaryan: They can't do anything about it if they let it go on, and then A dies.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: You can't recover anything, or you can't…

John Rogers: Well, maybe you could sue A's estate.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Oh, so it wouldn't pass down.

John Rogers: Potentially, for any damages.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Okay.

John Rogers: Other questions?

John Rogers: No? No? I missed someone? Did someone have their hand raised?

John Rogers: You know, I would probably say about 90% of this class, I've never… I don't think I've ever heard you say anything.

John Rogers: So, I saw a student at the valet, like, 2 weeks ago. He said, hey, professor, what's up?

John Rogers: And I look at him like, who are you? He's like, oh, I took you for property last year. I said, you never said a word. He says, I never said a word. I didn't even recognize the guy.

John Rogers: So, I mean, I would love to know what you sound like.

John Rogers: Just kind of melt my heart knowing what people sound like.

John Rogers: But usually, I can kind of tell when you call me, and you say something, I'll go, oh, it sounds like this person. Otherwise, I'm like, who is this?

John Rogers: What I'm getting at is…

John Rogers: In many, since I've been teaching this class, most of the students are too timid to say anything.

John Rogers: At this stage?

John Rogers: I think… And it's gonna get harder the next few weeks.

John Rogers: So usually they just don't know what to ask, so they're just quiet.

John Rogers: like, they'll say, like, oh, I think I'm gonna go inside the closet and, like, hide under a bunch of coats and hope that everything works out fine.

John Rogers: It's not gonna work like that. So, I mean, if you want to be friends, let's be friends sooner than later. I'm here to help you, okay? And I'll spend as much time as you want, and I won't yelp you.

John Rogers: We want to be friends right now.

John Rogers: Before I let you out.

John Rogers: Anybody have any questions?

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: Yeah, did you take roll today?

John Rogers: Indeed.

John Rogers: Took roll twice.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: Did you call out names, or…

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: Because I don't remember hearing my name.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: Or you just looked at the names, and you took a role like that.

John Rogers: Maybe I did it during break.

maddykoshkaryan: He never calls out names.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: Got it.

John Rogers: Who calls out names?

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: I don't know, my other professors.

maddykoshkaryan: It does a silent roll.

daniel Saghian: No, no, no, I'm asking, who does? That's all I want to know. Who does?

maddykoshkaryan: The other professor.

gevorg kulikyan: Bill Streets.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: Yeah, guilty.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Land?

John Rogers: Zanda's?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Zan, like, every…

maddykoshkaryan: John Yon!

John Rogers: She does out loud, they are all.

maddykoshkaryan: Do it out loud.

Sennett Devermont: And Casey and all of my professors do.

John Rogers: You're kidding. I have never done it out loud in my life.

maddykoshkaryan: Don't.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: No, it's better this way, but yeah, I was just asking.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: It takes, like, 10 minutes of the beginning of the class every time, so it's like…

John Rogers: I didn't know. I'm gonna ask them.

John Rogers: That would make fun.

gevorg kulikyan: role of somebody being?

John Rogers: Those people are, like, my bosses, so I can't say anything to them. You idiots, you can't do that. You shouldn't do that.

John Rogers: No, I didn't know that.

John Rogers: Noted.

John Rogers: But I'm still sticking by my ways of…

John Rogers: It's 9.15, I'm supposed to let you out, so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to parole you all

John Rogers: the entire week, I'll see you next week. I'll stick around if anyone should have any questions. Otherwise, you have my phone number, you have my email, so you can harass me all you want.

John Rogers: And it will be in the matrix.

John Rogers: There is no more in-person anymore. That's done, it's gone, it's dead, it's murdered, it's buried in the desert, it's never coming back.

John Rogers: Have a wonderful weekend.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Thank you, Professor.

Karen Hernandez: Thank you.

doven: Thank you, Professor.

Fatima Razavi: Thank you, Professor.

Mireya Gonzalez: Thank you.

maddykoshkaryan: Thanks, Professor.

gevorg kulikyan: Professor Lasker.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): President… Take care.

gevorg kulikyan: Last question, Professor. So, the doctrine of waste is not just to protect the monetary future interests of the…

gevorg kulikyan: What's it called?

gevorg kulikyan: Person receiving the property.

gevorg kulikyan: It's not just the monetary interest that it's protecting, like… The… so for negligent waste.

gevorg kulikyan: the omissions of upkeeping the property. If it gives them a hassle in upkeeping with the property in the future.

gevorg kulikyan: The doctrine of waste still stands.

John Rogers: I'm not sure I'm getting to where you're at, what you're saying, but look, for, like, affirmative waste.

gevorg kulikyan: If…

John Rogers: If the property has a bunch of oil.

John Rogers: And I'm the present interest holder, and you're the future interest holder, I can't soak up all that oil, wreak all the profits, and leave you with nothing.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah.

gevorg kulikyan: But again, see, that's protecting my monetary future interests.

John Rogers: And the value of the property, too.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah. Same with… Changing the character of the property.

gevorg kulikyan: If you're going to change it into a circus.

John Rogers: But monetary, I mean, it's increasing the value, too, for that type of waste.

John Rogers: So, I mean, it helps you monetarily, it may burden you, but it certainly increases the value of the asset.

gevorg kulikyan: Or if it's… yeah, if it's changing the character?

John Rogers: Yep.

John Rogers: But what's the rule? What's the rule? What's the rule?

gevorg kulikyan: I didn't… I didn't get a rule for that, the changing the character of the property. I mean, I understand what it is, but I don't have, like, a…

John Rogers: Did you get a rule?

gevorg kulikyan: For changing the character of the property?

John Rogers: You sure? Have you been… did you get all my emails?

gevorg kulikyan: Oh, I've… I've just been doing my own… I haven't looked at your notes.

gevorg kulikyan: Nothing on you, this is how I learned. I have to write it down for me to… Understand it.

John Rogers: You have it, so I purposely don't.

gevorg kulikyan: I'll get it.

gevorg kulikyan: For sure.

maddykoshkaryan: His notes really help.

John Rogers: They're perfect. There's…

maddykoshkaryan: Jay, they really are perfect.

John Rogers: Like, so perfect.

gevorg kulikyan: Right.

maddykoshkaryan: Not that I understand any of it, but it's really perfect.

John Rogers: kidding.

gevorg kulikyan: I'll use it. I just… Okay, so…

gevorg kulikyan: What was I saying? So, affirmative waste.

gevorg kulikyan: Or changing the character of the property.

John Rogers: well, what type of weight… I mean, that's in the book, too, the type… it's not changing the character, it's ameliative ways.

gevorg kulikyan: Sure.

gevorg kulikyan: Oh, that's not the type of…

gevorg kulikyan: Waste. A f- what was it called, though?

gevorg kulikyan: It's in my notes, it's in the book, and I said it a few times at class. I'll get it.

gevorg kulikyan: Alright, I get it.

gevorg kulikyan: There we go.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Thank you, Professor, good night.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

Yessenia Soria: I have a question, Professor.

Yessenia Soria: So, on the readings… We're on week 5, right?

Yessenia Soria: Because we didn't do the…

John Rogers: This is week 5, so yeah, I should, but don't worry, you'll probably have reading for week 6, and we will catch up. Let me go quick.

Yessenia Soria: Okay.

Yessenia Soria: I was gonna call you afterwards, but I have a headache.

Yessenia Soria: Can I call you tomorrow? I'll text you before I call you.

John Rogers: I'm getting on a plane at…

Yessenia Soria: Oh. Okay.

John Rogers: 6, so if you want to call or text him for that, otherwise I land at, like.

John Rogers: 805, so you can call.

Yessenia Soria: Is that in the morning or in the afternoon?

John Rogers: Night.

Yessenia Soria: Oh, okay.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, I'll text you in the morning.

John Rogers: Yeah, you can do that.

Yessenia Soria: I just feel like, like, my brain's overwhelmed, because I literally read.

John Rogers: Let me, let me stop.

Yessenia Soria: Cole…
