# Trespass to Land & Chattels

### 1. Trespass to Land (Scope of License)
* **Black Letter Law:** A trespass action will lie if a defendant enters land with permission (a license) but overstays the duration of the permission or fails to remove an object from the land after the license has expired.
    * **License Definition:** Permission/authority to enter upon the land of another.
* **Key Case:** *Rogers*
    * **Facts:** Defendant had a license to place a snow fence on the decedent's land during winter but failed to remove the post after the season/license expired. The husband died when his mower struck the post.
    * **Holding:** The failure to remove the object after the license expired reverted the defendant to the status of a trespasser.

### 2. Trespass to Chattel vs. Conversion
* **Black Letter Law:**
    * **Trespass to Chattel:** Requires either (1) some harm/damage to the chattel OR (2) dispossession of the chattel for a long enough period that the dispossession itself constitutes damage.
    * **Distinction from Conversion:** The difference is the **degree of interference**.
        * **Trespass to Chattel:** Shorter duration or less interference (e.g., taking a bike for an hour).
        * **Conversion:** substantial interference or total destruction (e.g., taking a bike for a month).
* **Key Cases:**
    * *Liden* (1949): Statutory strict liability for dog bites existed unless the plaintiff was trespassing. The court found a child playing with a dog did not commit trespass to chattel because there was no harm to the dog and no dispossession.
    * *CompuServe v. Cyber Promotions* (1997): Defendant sent unsolicited spam email using CompuServe’s routers. The court held that electronic signals are sufficiently physically tangible to support a trespass cause of action, and damages were satisfied by "intermeddling" that interfered with the possessor's interest.
    * *Pearson v. Dodd:* Former employees removed files, copied them, and returned the originals. Court held this was **not conversion** because the documents were returned before the owner could use them, and the information was not proprietary property.

# Affirmative Defenses to Intentional Torts

**General Procedural Rule:**
* Plaintiff must prove the prima facie elements of the tort (Case in Chief). Attacking the sufficiency of the plaintiff's case is *not* an affirmative defense.
* If the plaintiff meets their burden, the burden shifts to the defendant to raise affirmative defenses.
* **Legal Effect:** A valid affirmative defense is a **complete bar to recovery**.

### 1. Shopkeeper's Privilege
* **Black Letter Law:** A shopkeeper is privileged to detain a person if three elements are met:
    1.  **Reasonable Belief:** There must be a reasonable belief as to the theft.
    2.  **Reasonable Manner:** The detention must be conducted in a reasonable manner, and **no deadly force** can be used.
    3.  **Reasonable Time:** The detention must be only for a reasonable period of time to complete the investigation.

### 2. Consent
* **Black Letter Law:** Consent is a defense to intentional torts (e.g., Battery).
    * **Express Consent:** Exists where plaintiff has expressly submitted (written or oral) to defendant's conduct.
        * *Vitiation:* **Fraud** and **Duress** vitiate (nullify) consent.
    * **Implied Consent:**
        * **Apparent Consent:** Exists when a reasonable person would infer consent from the plaintiff's conduct.
        * **Consent Implied by Law:** Exists where action is necessary to save a person's life or an important interest in property (e.g., emergency surgery on an unconscious patient).
* **Key Cases:**
    * *Hackbart (Cincinnati Bengals):* Players imply consent to conduct within the rules of the game (Apparent Consent) but do not consent to intentional blows/conduct outside the rules.
    * *O'Brien (1891):* Plaintiff stood in line and held out her arm for a vaccination. Court held this was **apparent consent** manifested by her conduct.
    * *De May v. Roberts (1881):* A man falsely claiming to be a doctor's assistant held a woman's hand during childbirth. Any implied consent was invalid because it was obtained through **fraud** regarding his identity/qualifications.

### 3. Self-Defense & Defense of Others
* **Self-Defense Rule:** When a person has a reasonable belief that they are about to be attacked, they may use **reasonable force** for protection.
    * *Proportionality:* Force must be reasonable. Deadly force can only be used to counter deadly force.
* **Defense of Others Rule:** One may use force to defend another person **only when the other person could have used force**.
    * *Standard:* The defender steps into the shoes of the victim.

### 4. Defense of Property
* **Black Letter Law:** One may use reasonable force to prevent the **commission** of a tort against their property.
* **Limitations:**
    * Force can only be used while the tort is in progress (hot pursuit). Once the tort is completed (e.g., thief has escaped), force is no longer privileged.
    * **Deadly force** can **never** be used solely to defend property.

### 5. Public Necessity
* **Black Letter Law:** Where the act is for the public good, the defense is absolute.
* **Damages:** Those whose property is destroyed by an act of public necessity will **not** have the right to recover.
* **Examples:** Fire department smashing a car window to access a hydrant during a fire. Blowing up a house to create a firebreak during a city-wide conflagration.

### 6. Private Necessity
* **Black Letter Law:** A defendant acting out of private necessity is relieved of the technical tort of trespass but **must compensate** the plaintiff for any actual damage done.
* **Hypothetical:** A person seeks shelter under a stranger's porch during a severe lightning storm.
    * *Trespass:* The landowner cannot eject the person while the danger (storm) persists.
    * *Damages:* If the person breaks a vase or damages the floor while sheltering, they are liable for those damages.

### 7. Justification
* **Black Letter Law:** A "catch-all" defense used when other defenses do not fit, but it would be unjust to hold the defendant liable.
* **Elements:** Actions taken were reasonable and done to protect others from injury or to protect property.

### 8. Statute of Limitations
* **Definition:** A specific time period within which a legal action must be filed.
* **Nature:** It is an affirmative defense. A plaintiff can file a lawsuit after the period expires; the defendant must actively **raise** the statute of limitations defense.
* **Legal Effect:** If valid, it is a complete bar to recovery.

# Exam Writing Technique
* **Structure:**
    1.  Identify Parties.
    2.  Identify Cause of Action (e.g., Battery).
    3.  State Rule.
    4.  Analysis (Apply facts to Prima Facie elements).
    5.  Conclusion.
    6.  **Affirmative Defenses:** Always address this section. If no defenses apply, explicitly state: "The facts do not give rise to any affirmative defenses".
