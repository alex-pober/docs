title: "Session 06 - Acceptance"
description: "Acceptance, mirror image rule, UCC 2-207, bilateral vs unilateral contracts, consideration"
---

## I. ACCEPTANCE - FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES

### A. Definition of Acceptance
**Acceptance** = Assent to the terms of the offer in the proper form

**Central Question**: Did the offeree **intend to be bound** by the terms of the offer?
- Or did the offeree attempt to change the terms of the offer in any way?

### B. Standards for Acceptance

#### 1. Objective Standard (NOT Subjective)
- Contracts judged by **objective standard**
- "Received and understood" measured objectively, not subjectively
- Cannot escape contract by claiming lack of understanding
- Sophisticated parties held to higher standards

**Example**: Cannot sign contract in foreign language and claim non-binding due to lack of comprehension

#### 2. Perfect Tender Rule (UCC)
- Under UCC, perfect tender is expected

---

## II. MIRROR IMAGE RULE (Common Law)

### A. Definition
**Mirror Image Rule**: Acceptance must be exact mirror image of offer
- Nothing added
- Nothing deducted
- Nothing changed
- Literally a "carbon copy" of the offer
- Only proper response: "I accept"

### B. Violation of Mirror Image Rule
Any change to offer terms triggers:
1. **Rejection** of original offer
2. **Counteroffer** (new offer)

**Effect**: Original offer is **DEAD**
- Cannot be revived unless offeror puts it back on table

### C. Counteroffer Effects
**Counteroffer** = Both rejection of original offer AND publication of new offer

**Role Reversal**:
- Offeree becomes offeror
- Original offeror becomes offeree

**Example**:
- Painter offers $5,000 to paint home
- You respond: "I will never pay more than $4,000"
- Original $5,000 offer is dead
- Painter can revive: "No, I won't do $4,000. My original offer of $5,000 still stands"
- Now you can accept the revived $5,000 offer

### D. Mere Inquiry vs. Counteroffer

**Mere Inquiry** = Does NOT kill the offer
- Example: "Would you consider $4,000?"
- Just exploring possibilities

**Counteroffer** = Kills the offer
- Example: "I will never pay more than $4,000"
- Definite rejection + new proposal

---

## III. UCC § 2-207 - BATTLE OF THE FORMS

### A. General Rule (§ 2-207(1))
A definite seasonal acceptance OR written confirmation sent within reasonable time:
- **Operates as acceptance** even though it states additional or different terms

### B. Additional/Different Terms Between Merchants (§ 2-207(2))

Additional/different terms **may become part of contract** UNLESS:
1. Offer expressly limits acceptance to terms of offer, **OR**
2. Terms **materially alter** the contract (e.g., arbitration clause), **OR**
3. Notification of objection already given or given within reasonable time

### C. Non-Merchant Situations
If one or both parties are NOT merchants:
- Additional/different terms = **mere proposal**
- To be accepted or rejected separately

### D. Conduct of Parties (§ 2-207(3))
Conduct of parties may trigger formation of contract even without perfect acceptance

---

## IV. BILATERAL vs. UNILATERAL CONTRACTS

### A. Bilateral Contract

**Definition**: Promise for a promise

**Characteristics**:
- Both sides exchange promises
- Can only be accepted by a **promise** (express or implied)
- Contract formed upon exchange of promises

**Example**: "I promise to pay $2,000 if you promise to deliver laptop"

### B. Unilateral Contract

**Definition**: Promise for performance

**Characteristics**:
- Offer seeks **performance**, NOT a return promise
- Can only be accepted by **return performance**
- Return promise means nothing
- Generally requires **full performance** for contract formation

**Example**: "If you give me $2,000, I'll give you my laptop"

**Example**: "If you walk across Brooklyn Bridge, I'll pay $3,000"

### C. Modern Interpretation
**Modernly**: Unless specific response requested, offer interpreted as inviting acceptance by EITHER:
- Performance, OR
- Promise

---

## V. IMPLIED PROMISE

### A. Definition
**Implied promise** occurs when offeree:
1. **Begins performance** (not just preparation)
2. With **awareness of the offer**

### B. Requirements
- Offeree must be aware of offer
- Must begin actual performance
- Before beginning, must have knowledge

### C. Effect
- Beginning of performance = implied promise to accept
- Makes offer **irrevocable** for reasonable time
- NOT full acceptance (full performance still required for unilateral contracts)

---

## VI. CONSIDERATION

### A. Definition
**Consideration** = A bargain for exchange involving a **legal benefit** for a **legal detriment**

### B. Bargain for Exchange
- **Quid pro quo** relationship ("this for that")
- Between:
  - Promise for promise (bilateral), OR
  - Promise for performance (unilateral)

**Examples**:
- Mutual promises: "I promise to pay $2,000, you promise to deliver car"
- Restaurant: You part with money, they give you food

### C. Legal Detriment - Two Ways to Incur

#### 1. Performs or Promises to Perform
An act they have **NO pre-existing legal duty** to do

**Example**: Parting with your money (no duty to do so, but if you want food, you must pay)

#### 2. Refrains or Promises to Refrain
From performing an act they have a **legal right** to do

**Example**: Uncle/nephew case
- Nephew stops smoking/drinking (had legal right as adult)
- Uncle pays for abstinence
- Legally enforceable consideration

**Counterexample**:
- If nephew was 15 years old
- No consideration (illegal to smoke/drink underage)
- Not giving up legal right

### D. Pre-Existing Legal Duty Rule

**Rule**: Cannot claim consideration if already legally obligated to perform

**Example**: Police officer cannot collect reward for capture
- Pre-existing duty under California Penal Code § 842
- Applies on-duty AND off-duty
- "Once a cop, always a cop"

---

## VII. CASES

### A. Broadnox v. Ledbetter (Supreme Court of Texas)

**Facts**:
- Sheriff offered $500 reward for wanted person
- Plaintiff captured person and turned him in
- Plaintiff had **NO knowledge of reward** at time of capture
- Later discovered reward and requested payment
- Sheriff refused

**Issue**: Does one need knowledge of reward offer to collect it?

**Rule**: **Knowledge of offer required** to form contract
- Cannot accept offer without knowing it exists

**Holding**: No enforceable contract - no recovery

**Reasoning**:
- Contract formation requires **mutual assent** ("meeting of the minds")
- Plaintiff unaware of reward when performed
- No meeting of minds, no valid acceptance

**Key Quote**:
> "A mere offer or a promise to pay does not give rise to a contract. That requires the assent or meeting of the two minds... Such an offer may be accepted by anyone who performs a service called when **acceptor knows it has been made** and acts in performance of it, but **not otherwise**."

**Significance**:
- Must have **prior knowledge** of offer before beginning performance
- Cannot discover offer mid-performance or after and collect

---

### B. MCC Marble & Ceramic Center v. Ceramica Nuova D'Agostino

**Parties**:
- MCC (Florida company) - American owner who didn't speak Italian
- Ceramica (Italian tile manufacturer)

**Facts**:
- Used translator for oral agreement on basic terms for ceramic tile orders
- Tiles didn't arrive, MCC sued
- Ceramica relied on provisions on **back of contract** (written in Italian)
- MCC appealed - argued never intended to be bound by terms he couldn't understand

**Issue**: Is party bound by contract terms in foreign language they don't understand?

**Holding**: **YES** - Duty to read contract regardless of language

**Reasoning**:
> "Nothing short of astounding that individual purportedly experienced in commercial matters would sign contract in foreign language and expect not to be bound simply because he could not comprehend the terms."

- **Objective standard** applies
- Sophisticated international businessperson cannot claim ignorance
- Could have refused to sign, requested translation, or demanded contract in English

**Key Legal Principle**: **Duty to Read**
- Exists regardless of language barrier
- Objective standard - not what party subjectively understood
- What reasonable person would understand
- Cannot escape contractual obligations by claiming lack of understanding

**Exception**: California law requires certain dealers to provide contracts in multiple languages (e.g., Spanish for car sales) to prevent abuse

---

### C. Carlill v. Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. (1893)

**Facts**:
- Carbolic Smoke Ball Co. made medical devices (carbolic smokeballs)
- Advertised as preventative for influenza during public scare
- **Newspaper advertisement**: Anyone using smokeball 3 times daily for 2 weeks as directed who still contracts influenza will receive **£100**
- Company deposited **£1,000 in bank** as proof of sincerity
- Mrs. Carlill purchased smokeball, used as directed
- She contracted influenza, sued for £100 reward
- Company refused, arguing no binding contract (just puffery)

**Issues**:
1. Was advertisement binding offer or mere invitation to treat?
2. Was this puffery or genuine offer?

**Rule**: Advertisement can constitute offer if sufficiently definite and serious

**Holding**: Advertisement = **unilateral offer to the world**
- Accepted by performance (using smokeball as directed)
- Enforceable contract

**Reasoning**:

1. **Offer to General Public**: Offer CAN be made to general public

2. **Evidence of Seriousness**: £1,000 deposited with Alliance Bank
   - "Shows sincerity of the matter"
   - Not mere puffery

3. **Binding Offer**:
   > "In point of law, this advertisement is an offer to pay £100 to anybody who will perform these conditions. Performance of the conditions is acceptance of the offer."

4. **Notice NOT Required**:
   > "Person who makes offer may dispense with notice to himself if he thinks it desirable to do so."

   Court example:
   > "If I advertise to the world that my dog is lost...are all persons whose business it is to find lost dogs to be expected to sit down and write note saying they have accepted my proposal?"

   - Makes no sense to require prior notice for unilateral act
   - **Just perform**

**Significance**:
- Exception to general rule that advertisements are NOT offers
- Rewards for unilateral contracts are enforceable
- Notice of acceptance not required for unilateral contracts
- Performance = acceptance

**Note**: Police cannot accept reward money (pre-existing legal duty)

---

### D. Leonard v. PepsiCo (Harrier Jet Case)

**Facts**:
- Pepsi created "Pepsi Points" advertising program
- Commercial showed items purchasable with Pepsi points
- Commercial showed **Harrier Jet** delivered to school - displayed "7,000,000 Pepsi Points"
- Plaintiff argued this was offer and attempted to collect jet
- Pepsi refused

**Issue**: Was commercial an offer or invitation for offer?

**Holding**: **NOT an offer** - mere advertisement inviting buyer to make offer

**Distinction from Carbolic Smokeball**:

| Carbolic Smokeball | PepsiCo |
|-------------------|---------|
| Sought **performance** | Sought **promise/offer from buyer** |
| Serious (£1,000 deposited as proof) | **Joke/puffery** - no reasonable person would believe |
| Clear, definite terms | Not definite offer |
| Was actual **OFFER** | Was **invitation to make offer** |

**Court Reasoning**:
- One case: advertisement was offer
- PepsiCo: advertisement was invitation for buyer to make offer
- **Reasonable person standard**: Would reasonable person believe Pepsi would give Harrier Jet to teenager?
- No evidence of seriousness (unlike smokeball's bank deposit)

**Significance**: Courts distinguish offer from invitation to offer based on:
- Evidence of seriousness
- What reasonable person would conclude
- Whether seeking performance vs. seeking buyer's offer
- Nature of promise (realistic vs. puffery)

---

### E. Secretarial v. RJ Reynolds Tobacco Company (9th Circuit, 2012)

**Facts**:
- RJ Reynolds ran "Camel Cash" program
- Customers collected coupons (C-notes) from cigarette packages
- Coupons redeemable for merchandise from catalog
- Company discontinued program abruptly
- Customers unable to redeem coupons
- Customers sued for breach of contract

**Issue**: Did Camel Cash program create enforceable unilateral contract obligating redemption?

**Rule**: Offer for unilateral contract accepted by performance; revocation after performance begins may constitute breach

**Holding**: Coupon program created enforceable unilateral contract
- RJR made standing offer promising merchandise in exchange for Camel Cash
- Customers accepted by buying cigarettes and collecting coupons
- Company could not revoke arbitrarily without giving consumers chance to redeem
- Plaintiffs stated valid breach claim

---

#### Key Legal Principles from RJ Reynolds

**1. Definition of Offer**:
> "Offer is manifestation of willingness to enter into bargain, so made as to justify another person in understanding that **his assent to that bargain is invited and will conclude it**."

- Once you assent, bargain is concluded
- No need to say more than "I accept"

**2. Test for Offer**:
> "Determination of whether particular communication constitutes operative offer, rather than inoperative step in preliminary negotiation, **depends upon all surrounding circumstances**."

**Pertinent Inquiry**:
> "Whether individual to whom communication was made has reason to believe it was **intended as an offer**."

**3. Bilateral Contract Definition**:
> "Bilateral contract consists of **mutual promises made in exchange for each other** by each of two contracting parties."

Both sides must have made promises

**4. Conditions vs. Promises**:
- Terms can be "conditions that plaintiff were required to satisfy to trigger RJR duty to perform"
- NOT same as "promise that plaintiff were bound to perform to avoid incurring their own contractual liability"

**5. Promise** (Restatement 2d § 224):
> "Express or implied declaration in contract that raises duty to perform and subjects promisor to liability for breach or failure to do so."

**6. Unilateral Contract**:
> "Involves exchange of **promise for performance**. Offer accepted by **rendering performance** rather than providing promise."

*See* Restatement 2d § 45

**7. Advertisements - General Rule with Exception**:

**General Rule**:
> "Advertisements of goods by display, sign, handbill, newspaper, radio, or television are **not ordinarily intended or understood to be offers**."

**EXCEPTION**:
> "Offers of reward, including offers of reward for redemption of coupons."

**8. Reward Offers**:
> "Very common where one desires to **induce many people to action**...to offer reward for such action by general publication."

> "Statement that plausibly makes offer of this kind must be reasonably interpreted according to **terms and surrounding circumstances**."

> "If statement calls for performance or commencement of performance of specific acts, actions in accordance will **close contract** or **make offer irrevocable**."

**9. Buyers' Advertisements**:
> "Advertisements placed by **buyers** inviting sellers to ship goods without prior communication are **clear cases of offers**."

**Example**: *Payne v. Louth's Press* (1916) - reward coupons with soap wrappers
- Found enforceable unilateral contract
- Defendant advertised round-trip train ticket for consumers collecting 25 coupons from soap packages

**10. Over-Acceptance Problem**:
- Common law rule (ads not offers) arose to address "potential for over-acceptance"
- **RJR Case Different**: "RJR alone decides how many C notes to distribute"
- Exercises absolute control over number of acceptances
- No reason to presume communication did not constitute offer

---

#### Evidence of Offer - Totality of Circumstances

Court found offer based on 7 factors:

1. **Repeated use of word "offer"** in C-notes
2. **Absence of disclaimer** of intent to be bound
3. **Specific restrictions** in C-notes:
   - "Offer restricted to smokers 21 years of age or older"
   - "Offer good only in USA"
   - "Void when restricted or prohibited by law"
   - "Check catalog for expiration date"
   - "Limit 5 requests for catalog per household"

**Conclusion**: Court found RJR **intended an offer**

---

#### Illusory Promise

**Definition**: If offeror expressly reserves:
- Not only right to revoke offer at will or without notice, BUT ALSO
- **Unrestricted right not to perform**
- Then offer is **not legally effective as offer at all**

**What Makes Promise Illusory**:
- Promisor has complete discretion whether to perform
- "If I want to" language
- Right to cancel at any time without notice
- No actual commitment = no offer

**Example**:
- Car dealer: "I'll give you car for $20,000"
- You: "I promise to buy if I want to, maybe today, maybe tomorrow, but I have right to cancel any time without notice"
- This is **illusory** - not binding
- No manifestation of intent to be bound

**RJR Did NOT Make Illusory Promise**:
- Court found RJR committed for definite period (6 months)
- Not illusory

**Other Examples of Illusory Promise**:
- "Agree to agree" = illusory promise
- "I agree if I want to, maybe" = illusory

---

#### Significance

**Comparison**:

| Leonard (PepsiCo) | RJ Reynolds |
|------------------|-------------|
| Illusory promotional promise | Serious and defined offer |
| Puffery | Inducing consumer reliance |
| Joke (Harrier Jet) | Genuine program |

**Acceptance by Conduct**:
- Buying cigarettes and collecting coupons = acceptance AND consideration

**Professor's Note**: "Most important case of evening"
- Reviews most concepts covered so far
- Discusses: offers, acceptance, puffery, illusory promises
- "Amazing decision" - comprehensive review in "plain, beautiful, concise language"

---

## VIII. PROPER FORM OF ACCEPTANCE

### A. Determining Proper Form
**Central Question**: Was this offer to bilateral or unilateral contract?

### B. Bilateral Contract Acceptance
- Offer to bilateral contract can **only be accepted by promise**
- Promise may be **express** or **implied**

### C. Unilateral Contract Acceptance
- Offer to unilateral contract can **only be accepted by return performance**
- Generally requires **full performance** for contract formation
- **Exception**: Beginning of performance makes offer **irrevocable** for reasonable time

### D. Beginning Performance - Special Rule

If offeree **begins performance** (not just preparation):
- Offer becomes **irrevocable** for reasonable time
- Offeror cannot revoke by saying "I changed my mind"
- Offeree can sue if offeror attempts revocation
- BUT still needs full performance to complete contract

**Example**:
- Offer: "Walk across Brooklyn Bridge on Saturday at noon for $3,000"
- Offeree shows up, books flight, hotel, ready to walk
- Offeror says "I changed my mind"
- **Result**: Too late - beginning of performance makes offer irrevocable
- Must allow reasonable time to complete performance

---

## IX. ADVERTISEMENTS AS OFFERS

### A. General Rule
**Advertisements generally NOT offers** - invitation for offer from buyer

### B. Exceptions - When Advertisement IS an Offer

**1. Rewards for Unilateral Contracts**
- FBI reward for information
- Lost dog rewards
- Redemption coupons

**2. Specific Identifying Information**
- VIN number for specific car
- Particular identified goods
- Example: "Ford Mustang VIN 1234 for sale at $X"

**3. Evidence of Seriousness**
- Money deposited in bank (*Carbolic Smokeball*)
- Specific terms and conditions
- Absence of disclaimer

### C. Responding to Advertisement

**Important Rule**: Response to advertisement = making an offer (not acceptance)

**MBE Tip**: When responding to advertisement, you're typically making offer
- State Bar uses this as trick question
- Fall for this if unsure

**Example**:
- See general ad: "Lease Porsche Cayenne for $1,800/month"
- Call dealer: "Do you have car with these specific specs available at this price?"
- **You just made an offer** (not accepting their offer)
- Dealer can accept by saying "Yes, it's ready for you"

---

## X. NOTICE OF ACCEPTANCE

### A. General Rule
- Notice typically required for bilateral contracts
- Notice may be waived by offeror

### B. Unilateral Contracts - Notice NOT Required
- Performance = acceptance
- No need to notify offeror before or during performance

**Rationale**: Makes no sense to require notice for acts like finding lost dog

### C. Offeror as Master of Offer
> "Person who makes offer may dispense with notice to himself."

- Can expressly or impliedly indicate particular mode of acceptance
- Offeree must follow indicated method

---

## XI. DEATH OF OFFEROR

### A. General Rule
- **If offeror dies, offer dies** with offeror
- Cannot accept offer after offeror's death

### B. Exception - Performance Already Begun
If performance already begun (unilateral contract):
- Beginning of performance = acceptance OR makes offer irrevocable
- May have claim against **estate**
- Must sue estate (offeror is dead)

### C. No Performance Begun
- If offer not yet accepted and no performance begun
- Death of offeror terminates offer

---

## XII. OPTION CONTRACTS

### A. Definition
Contract where offer remains open for specified period
- Requires **consideration** to be enforceable

### B. Common Law Rule
- Offers are freely revocable until accepted
- **Exception**: Option contract with consideration
- Example: "Here's $1, keep offer open for 3 days"

### C. UCC Merchant Firm Offer (§ 2-205)
- Merchant can send signed writing saying offer remains open
- **Maximum period**: **90 days (3 months)** - CAPPED BY STATUTE
- Even if merchant says "120 days," only enforceable for 90 days
- **No consideration required** (exception to common law rule)

### D. Without Consideration
- Mere statement "offer open for 3 days" is NOT binding
- Offeror can revoke before acceptance
- Not actually "open" unless consideration paid

### E. Lease Example
- 5-year lease with option to renew
- Signing of lease = consideration for option
- Can exercise option at specified time and price

---

## XIII. ILLUSORY CONSIDERATION

### A. Definition
Consideration that is fake or worthless
- Not real bargain for exchange

### B. Examples
- **One penny**: Most courts say not real consideration
- Could be $5, $10 depending on:
  - Past relationship of parties
  - Prior dealings (if done same way for 20 years, court may enforce)
  - Context and reasonableness

---

## XIV. HYPO PROBLEMS

### Problem 1 (Page 100)
**Facts**: Grandfather says to granddaughter: "If you make Pi Delta Kappa, I will pay you $20,000." Granddaughter **promises** to attain membership.

**Question**: Is there contract?

**Answer**: **NO**

**Reasoning**:
- This is offer to **unilateral contract**
- Grandfather seeking **performance** (making Pi Delta Kappa)
- Granddaughter gave **promise** instead
- Promise is nullity - doesn't accept unilateral offer
- Must actually **perform** (make Pi Delta Kappa)
- No contract formed

---

### Problem 2 (Page 100-101)
**Facts**: On June 10, homeowners executed instrument for roofing company to re-roof residence. Document contained all material terms plus: "This agreement shall become binding only upon written acceptance thereof, **or** upon performance of work."

**Questions**:
1. Who makes offer?
2. Does offer invite acceptance by performance only, promise only, or either?

**Answers**:
1. **Homeowners make offer** (to roofing company)
2. Offer invites **BOTH promise AND performance**

**Reasoning**:
- "Written acceptance thereof" = promise/bilateral acceptance
- "Upon performance of work" = unilateral/performance acceptance
- Offeror left door open for either method
- Roofing company can accept by:
  - Signing agreement (promise), OR
  - Starting/completing work (performance)

---

### Problem 3 (Page 101)
**Facts**: A says to B: "If you promise to rake my lawn today, I promise to pay you $25." B starts to rake in A's presence (no express promise).

**Question**: Is there contract?

**Answer**: **YES - Implied acceptance**

**Reasoning**:
- Offer to **bilateral contract** (seeking promise)
- B did NOT give express promise
- B **began performance** in A's presence
- **Implied acceptance** created
- A was present and could have objected/stopped B
- A remained silent = implied acceptance
- B's conduct + A's silence = contract formed

**Policy**:
- Would be unfair to let A refuse payment after B performs work
- A watched B perform and said nothing
- Implies assent to the work

**Key Distinction**:
- Different if A had left and B performed in A's absence
- Then no notice of acceptance
- Might not be contract

---

### Problem 4 (Page 101) - TRICKY QUESTION

**Facts**:
- January 2: A promises B to pay $7,500 if B paints outside of A's summer house at Point Lookout **within 2 weeks from January 2**
- A states: "This offer is **open for 3 days**"
- B makes no express promise
- B begins job **January 4** (within 3 days)
- B completes job **January 9** (within 2 weeks)

**Question**: Is there contract?

**Initial Answer**: Most students say **unilateral** (seeking performance)

**CORRECT Answer**: This is **BILATERAL** offer (seeking promise)

**Reasoning - Key to Analysis**:

1. **Language Analysis**:
   - "Within 2 weeks from January 2" = can perform anytime in 14-day window
   - "Offer open for 3 days" = seeking response within 3 days

2. **"Open for 3 Days" Implication**:
   - If purely unilateral (performance only), why limit acceptance period to 3 days?
   - Cannot complete performance in 3 days (need up to 2 weeks)
   - **Clearly implies** A wants **promise** within 3 days
   - Not seeking completion within 3 days

3. **Bilateral vs. Unilateral**:
   - If truly unilateral: "Only way to accept is by painting house within 2 weeks. Thank you, goodbye."
   - But A said offer "open for 3 days" - left door open
   - Implies B can call and say "I accept" within 3 days

4. **Court Interpretation**:
   - Court would say: "You actually wanted return promise, not performance"
   - Otherwise wouldn't limit offer acceptance period to 3 days
   - Two-week performance window ≠ three-day acceptance window

**Teaching Point**:
- "There is no black and white in law school"
- "Always leave door open for possibility"
- Must read every word carefully
- Ask: "Why is this detail here? Is it red herring?"

**Exam Strategy**: If offered "unilateral" or "bilateral because implied promise," choose **bilateral**
- The 3-day language is key to analysis

---

#### Additional Issue: Is Offer Actually Open for 3 Days?

**Facts**: A says "offer open for 3 days"

**Question**: Can A revoke before 3 days expire?

**Answer**: **YES** - offer NOT actually open for 3 days

**Reasoning**:

1. **Common Law Rule**: Offers are freely revocable until accepted
   - Unless consideration paid for option contract

2. **No Consideration Here**:
   - No payment to keep offer open
   - No "Here's $1, keep offer open 3 days"
   - Therefore NOT option contract

3. **Can Revoke Any Time**:
   - Before acceptance, A can say "I revoke my offer"
   - Statement "open for 3 days" is not binding without consideration
   - It's open as long as A hasn't revoked it

4. **If Consideration Paid**:
   - Then becomes **option contract**
   - Must keep open for 3 days
   - Cannot revoke

5. **UCC Alternative** (if applicable):
   - Merchant firm offer (§ 2-205)
   - Signed writing by merchant
   - No consideration needed
   - Max 90 days (3 months)
   - But this is common law question (services, not goods)

**Consideration for Options**:
- Must be real consideration (not illusory)
- One penny = usually not sufficient (courts say it's fake)
- Could be $5, $10 depending on:
  - Past relationship
  - Prior course of dealing
  - Context

---

## XV. REWARD OFFERS - SPECIAL RULES

### Multiple Reward Offers
**Scenario**: FBI offers $100,000 + Elon Musk offers $50,000 + Governor offers reward

**Question**: Can performer collect from all?

**Answer**: Potentially **YES** from all who made offers IF:
1. Performer had **knowledge of each offer** before performing
2. Source was **credible** (reasonable person standard)
3. Not mutually exclusive

**Analysis**:
- Each offer = separate contract
- Same performance satisfies all
- No pre-existing duty (if private citizen)
- Can collect from each offeror

**Credible Source Test**:
- Would reasonable person rely on source?
- FBI = yes (full faith & credit of U.S. government)
- Elon Musk on official X account = probably yes (makes business when makes offer)
- Random person with 500 followers = probably no

**Knowledge Requirement**:
- Must know about reward BEFORE performing
- If only knew about FBI reward, can only collect $100,000
- Cannot collect from Elon if didn't know about his offer before performing

---

## XVI. EXAM TIPS & PRACTICAL ADVICE

### A. Writing Style
- **Be BASIC** - not sophisticated
- More basic = better grade
- Don't complicate language
- "Don't try to look like scholar"
- Just give facts, follow law, argue with facts

### B. Using Case Names & Citations

**General Advice**: **DON'T use case names** (except UCC 2-207)

**Reasoning**:
- If you make small mistake (wrong case name or facts), graders will ding you
- Most graders know important cases by heart
- Risk of error outweighs benefit

**Exception**:
- UCC § 2-207 - can reference by number
- But can also just say "Under UCC, Battle of the Forms..." without number

**Can Reference**:
- Restatement sections (if certain)
- General principles without case names
- Court reasoning/language (without attribution)

### C. Using Analogies & Examples

**YES - Can and Should Use**:
- Analogies to explain concepts
- Hypotheticals to illustrate points
- Common sense examples
- "Absolutely can use analogies" - same as court arguments

**Best Practice**:
- Stick to facts given in question
- Can add examples if helps demonstrate understanding
- Use to convey that you understand concepts

### D. AI Use Warning

**STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**:
- 9 students kicked out for using AI
- Exam questions designed to detect AI answers
- School MUST report to State Bar
- **Consequence**: Cannot attend ANY law school in country
- Permanent bar from legal profession
- "Not worth ruining your life"

**Example**: Student caught cheating on final
- Video camera evidence
- Hired best lawyer to sue school - unsuccessful
- Reported to State Bar
- **28 years later, still not a lawyer**
- Never recovered

---

## XVII. KEY DEFINITIONS

1. **Acceptance**: Assent to terms of offer in proper form

2. **Offer**: Manifestation of willingness to enter bargain, so made as to justify another in understanding their assent will conclude it

3. **Bilateral Contract**: Mutual promises made in exchange for each other by each of two contracting parties

4. **Unilateral Contract**: Exchange of promise for performance; accepted by rendering performance rather than providing promise

5. **Consideration**: Bargain for exchange involving legal benefit for legal detriment

## XIX. ADDITIONAL LEGAL PRINCIPLES

### A. Duty to Read
- Every party has **duty to read** contract
- Cannot claim "didn't read" or "didn't understand"
- Applies even to foreign language (for sophisticated parties)
- **Exceptions**:
  - California law requires certain contracts in multiple languages
  - Dealers must provide car sales contracts in Spanish (if applicable)

### B. Battery in Medical Context

**Definition**: Performing treatment without consent = **battery**

**Examples**:
1. Patient consents to remove tooth #3
   - Doctor removes tooth #4 instead
   - **Battery** - no consent for tooth #4

2. Patient consents to COVID shot
   - Receives flu shot instead
   - **Battery** - no consent for flu shot

3. Patient sedated in dentist chair
   - Dentist/nurse steals wallet
   - **NOT medical malpractice** - it's **theft/embezzlement**

**Rationale**:
- Must have consent for specific treatment
- Performing different treatment = battery
- Not all acts in medical office are "medical malpractice"

### C. Boxing Ring Analogy - Consent
- Boxer consents to being punched (hand-to-hand)
- Does NOT consent to:
  - Use of weapons
  - Kicks (if not allowed in rules)
- Exceeding scope of consent = battery/assault
