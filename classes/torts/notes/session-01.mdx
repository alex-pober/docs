# Session 01 - Foundations & Introduction to Torts

## I. Foundations of American Law

### Historical and Philosophical Foundations

**Primary Sources of Law:**
- Code of Hammurabi
- Old Testament (613 Commandments, not just 10)
- New Testament
- Magna Carta
- United States Constitution

**Definition of Law:**
- Law is humanity's feeble attempt to put into words our notion of justice and equity

**Judeo-Christian Legal System:**
- American judicial system is primarily a Judeo-Christian system
- Heavily influenced by Jewish legal traditions
- Primary commandments: 613 total commandments in the Bible (categorized as laws, testimonies, and decrees)

**English Common Law:**
- Approximately 700 years old
- American jurisprudence is based on English common law
- The 13 original colonies imported English law as the law of the land
- Common law is still the law of the land unless overwritten by statute or appellate court decisions

### Sources of American Law

**Common Law:**
- Common law is the "DOS" (digital operating system) of American law
- Remains the law of the land today across all 50 states
- Can only be changed by:
  1. Legislative action (statutes enacted by Congress or state legislatures)
  2. Appellate court decisions

**Statute vs. Statue:**
- **Statute** = a law (correct usage)
- **Statue** = a monument (incorrect when referring to law)

---

## II. Constitutional Law Principles

### Federal System Structure

**Sovereignty:**
- The United States has 51 sovereign entities:
  - 50 sovereign states (each acts as a "king" under common law)
  - 1 Federal government (the "king of kings")

**Supremacy Clause:**
- Federal law is the supreme law of the land
- When California law conflicts with Federal law, Federal law wins
- Federal law preempts all contrary state law

**Preemption Doctrine:**
- Federal law preempts contrary state law
- Example: California cannot pass a law allowing waterboarding of defendants because it violates the 5th Amendment
- Example: Social Security Administration is Federal law; California courts cannot interfere with division of social security benefits in divorce cases

**5th Amendment:**
- You cannot be compelled to testify against yourself
- Protects against self-incrimination

**Constitutional Muster:**
- A law must pass constitutional muster to be valid
- Laws that violate the Constitution are unconstitutional and invalid

---

## III. Courtroom Structure and Procedures

### Physical Layout of Courtroom

**The Bar:**
- A 2.5 to 3-foot high barrier separating public from court proceedings
- Only lawyers can pass beyond the bar
- Origin of term "passing the bar"
- Swing door that leads to the court area

**Public Seating:**
- All courts are open to the public except:
  - Juvenile criminal proceedings
  - Dependency court proceedings
- Public sits to the left and right upon entering

**Council Tables:**
- Two tables: one for plaintiff, one for defendant
- **Party with burden of proof sits closer to jury box** (preferential seating)
  - In civil cases: plaintiff sits closer to jury
  - In criminal cases: prosecutor sits closer to jury

**Jury Box:**
- Can be on either left or right side of courtroom
- **12 jurors** (based on Jesus Christ having 12 apostles)
- **Alternates:** Judge determines number (4, 6, 8, etc.) based on expected case length
  - Alternates hear entire case
  - Can replace voting jurors if needed to prevent mistrial
  - Alternates do not vote

**The Bench:**
- Where judge sits
- Judge is called a "bench officer"
- Historical origin: In medieval England, King sent aristocrats to villages to dispense justice; they sat at a bench

**The Well:**
- Area in front of the bench
- No one may walk across the well under any circumstances
- Historical origin: An actual ditch to protect the King's representative from villagers (villainous villagers)
- Width: Arm's length plus length of a sword (so villagers couldn't pull sword and stab the King's representative)
- Tradition continues in 21st century Los Angeles courts

**Witness Stand:**
- Where witnesses testify

**Court Clerk Position:**
- Usually sits to the side (not in center)

**Bailiff/Deputy Position:**
- Sits near the courtroom
- Responsible for courtroom security
- Will physically prevent anyone from entering the well

### Roles in the Courtroom

**Judge:**
- **Decides questions of law**
- Is NOT the "13th juror"
- Can hear post-verdict motions (additur or remittitur to increase/decrease judgment)
- Can grant judgment notwithstanding verdict (JNOV)
- Can set aside verdict as matter of error
- Judge never sits in jury room or acts as a juror

**Jury:**
- **Finders of fact**
- 12 voting members
- Decide whether plaintiff wins or loses
- Award damages in civil cases
- Render guilty/not guilty verdicts in criminal cases

**Attorneys:**
- Only attorneys can go past the bar
- Sit at council tables during proceedings
- Attorneys waiting for their case sit in chairs near council tables

---

## IV. Burden of Proof

### Three Burdens of Proof

**1. Preponderance of the Evidence (LOWEST)**
- **Definition:** More likely than not; 51%
- **Used in:** Civil cases
- **Standard:** In a civil case, plaintiff's burden of proof is to the preponderance of the evidence
- Plaintiff must prove it's more likely than not that defendant is liable

**2. Clear and Convincing Evidence (MIDDLE)**
- **Definition:** Evidence that there is a high probability that a fact is true
- **Used in:** Civil cases for certain claims (e.g., punitive damages)
- Higher than preponderance but lower than beyond a reasonable doubt

**3. Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (HIGHEST)**
- **Used in:** Criminal cases only
- Prosecutor must prove defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
- Higher burden because prosecution can take away life or liberty

### Why Different Burdens?

**Civil vs. Criminal Consequences:**
- **Civil case:** Can only take money from defendant (lower burden = preponderance)
- **Criminal case:** Can incarcerate defendant or impose capital punishment (higher burden = beyond reasonable doubt)

**Punitive Damages Rationale:**
- In civil cases, plaintiff first proves case by preponderance to be made whole
- To award **punitive damages** (to punish and deter), higher burden required: clear and convincing
- Purpose of punitive damages: Punish defendant and deter similar future conduct
- Example: Hate crime battery (based on sexual orientation, skin color, gender, place of origin, religion)

### Party with Burden of Proof

**In Civil Cases:**
- **Plaintiff has burden of proof**
- Must prove case to preponderance of evidence
- Defendant does not have to do anything unless/until plaintiff meets burden

**In Criminal Cases:**
- **Prosecutor has burden of proof**
- Must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
- Defendant does not have to do anything; can "sit and twiddle thumbs"

---

## V. Civil Law vs. Criminal Law

### Fundamental Distinction - Firewall Between Civil and Criminal Law

**IMPORTANT RULE:** There is a firewall between criminal law and civil law
- Do NOT try to reconcile them
- Different procedures, different lexicon, different rules
- Criminal law battery (Penal Code Section 242) has minimal commonality with tort law battery
- Never use criminal law language in civil cases
- Never use civil law language in criminal cases

### Terminology Differences

**Civil Law:**
- Defendant found **LIABLE**
- **Liability** (not guilt)
- Civil wrong = **TORT**

**Criminal Law:**
- Defendant found **GUILTY**
- **Convicted**
- Penal Code Section 242 = battery

**11th Commandment (Professor's Rule):**
- Thou shalt NOT use criminal law language in civil cases
- Thou shalt NOT use civil law language in criminal courses

### Case Examples

**O.J. Simpson Case:**
- **Criminal case:** Found NOT guilty (could not meet burden of beyond reasonable doubt)
- **Civil case:** Found LIABLE in wrongful death case (met burden of preponderance - 51%)
- No inconsistency - different burdens of proof
- If found guilty in criminal case, civil case would only need to determine damages (higher standard already met)
- If found liable in civil case, meaningless in criminal case (lower standard insufficient)

**Rodney King Case:**
- **State Court:** Officers found not guilty
- **Federal Court:** Officers found guilty of civil rights violations
- Why no double jeopardy? Different sovereigns prosecuting

---

## VI. Double Jeopardy

### Double Jeopardy Doctrine

**Definition:**
- Once convicted of a crime, cannot be retried for the same crime
- Once acquitted (not guilty verdict), prosecutor cannot take another shot at defendant

**Limitation - Sovereign Exception:**
- Double jeopardy only applies to the **same sovereign**
- Each state is a sovereign ("king")
- Federal government is a separate sovereign ("king of kings")
- State prosecution does not bar Federal prosecution for same conduct

**Example - Rodney King:**
- State of California prosecuted once (not guilty verdict)
- State could not re-prosecute due to double jeopardy
- Federal government (different sovereign) prosecuted for civil rights violations
- Federal prosecution did not violate double jeopardy

---

## VII. Tort Law Fundamentals

### Definition and Purpose

**What is a Tort?**
- **A tort is a civil wrong**

**Purpose of Tort Law:**
- **To make plaintiff whole again (W-H-O-L-E)**
- Cannot give back what was lost (e.g., missing toe, finger)
- Jury puts dollar value on injury/loss
- Defendant must pay that amount to compensate plaintiff

**Value Varies by Plaintiff:**
- Same injury worth different amounts depending on plaintiff
- Example: Professor's finger vs. LeBron James's finger
  - Professor missing finger: Minimal impact on law practice
  - LeBron James missing finger: Billion dollars in damages

### Tort Law as Fault-Based System

**Fundamental Principle:**
- **Tort law is a fault-based system of recovery**
- Must prove fault to recover
- If cannot show fault, no recovery

### Three Ways to Prove Fault

**1. Intentional Torts**
- Person intended to cause harmful or offensive touching
- Intent can be specific or general (defined below)

**2. Negligence**
- No intent, but carelessness
- Conduct fell below standard of care of reasonable, prudent person under the circumstances

**3. Strict Liability**
- Engaged in abnormally dangerous activity
- Can recover **without showing fault**
- Example: Dynamite blasting business
  - Allowed to engage in activity
  - But if anyone injured, they can recover without showing fault
- Does NOT apply to ordinary activities like driving

---

## VIII. Intent - Types and Definitions

### Battery - First Tort Definition

**Battery:**
- **An intentional act that causes a harmful or offensive touching of the plaintiff's person**
- Must memorize this definition
- Will be tested on California State Bar exam

### Two Types of Intent

**1. Specific Intent**
- Defendant **wanted to bring about that particular consequence**
- Defendant's goal was to bring about those specific consequences
- Example: Intended to blind the person

**2. General Intent**
- Actor intends a consequence of his conduct **if he knows with substantial certainty that those consequences will occur**
- Example: Swinging cane in proximity to plaintiff's face with substantial certainty it will strike face
- Still provides basis for intentional tort even without specific intent

---

## IX. Causes of Action and Theories of Recovery

### Theory of Recovery / Cause of Action

**Definition:**
- **Theory of recovery** = How attorney will make client whole again
- Also called **cause of action**
- Attorney must determine which cause of action applies

**Example - Dog Fighting Case (Kendall v. Brown):**
- Facts: Two dogs fighting; owner used cane to separate them; upward motion of cane blinded other dog owner
- Attorney analysis:
  1. Was conduct intentional? → Battery cause of action
  2. If no intent, was conduct careless? → Negligence cause of action
  3. Was it abnormally dangerous activity? → Strict liability (No in this case)

### Prima Facie Elements

**Prima Facie:**
- Latin term meaning "on its face" or "at first appearance"
- Appears in every law school subject (contracts, torts, etc.)

**Prima Facie Elements:**
- The required components of a cause of action
- Plaintiff must prove each and every prima facie element

**Example - Negligence (will learn in detail later):**
1. Duty
2. Breach
3. Causation
4. Damages

---

## X. Anatomy of a Trial

### Plaintiff's Case in Chief

**Opening:**
- Court says: "Attorney [name], you may proceed"
- Plaintiff's attorney presents evidence to establish each prima facie element
- Evidence can be testimony, documents, or other forms

**Plaintiff Rests:**
- When plaintiff has met burden of proof for each prima facie element
- Attorney states: "Your Honor, plaintiff rests"
- Legal meaning: "We have met our burden of proof to meet each and every prima facie element"

### Defendant's Response

**Motion to Dismiss:**
- After plaintiff rests, defendant moves for dismissal
- Argues: "Plaintiff has failed to meet his or her burden of proof"
- Judge rules yes or no

**If Plaintiff Met Burden:**
- Burden of proof shifts to defendant
- Defendant must raise **affirmative defenses**

### Affirmative Defenses

**Definition:**
- **A complete bar to recovery**
- Even if plaintiff proved case, affirmative defense defeats claim

**Example:**
- Plaintiff sues for battery
- Defendant raises affirmative defense: **Self-defense**
- If proven, bars plaintiff's recovery

---

## XI. Case Briefing Method - IRAC

### Components of a Case Brief

**1. Facts (Operative Facts)**
- Identify only facts that matter to legal analysis
- Ignore irrelevant details (e.g., "dark and stormy night," color of cane)
- Example (Kendall v. Brown): Two dogs fighting; owner used cane to separate; upward motion hit other owner, blinding him

**2. Issue**
- What legal question is court deciding?
- Example: Did defendant act intentionally?

**3. Rule**
- State the black letter law
- Example: Intent is either specific or general intent [followed by definitions]

**4. Analysis**
- Apply facts to the law
- Show reasoning process

**5. Conclusion**
- Final determination

### IRAC Method

**I**ssue - **R**ule - **A**nalysis - **C**onclusion

**Repeat for each issue:**
- Issue → Rule → Analysis → Conclusion
- May have multiple causes of action in one case
- Each gets own IRAC analysis

## XII. Study Tips and Bar Exam Preparation

### Memorization is Critical

**California State Bar is a Memorization Exam:**
- Not open book
- Must memorize black letter law
- Cannot sit and think about definitions during timed exam

**Multiple Choice Questions:**
- 100 questions in 3 hours
- Must retrieve information quickly
- Memorization essential for speed

**When to Memorize:**
- Memorize as you go throughout law school
- Do NOT wait until 2 months before bar to memorize 11 subjects
- If you memorize material now, it comes back faster when studying for bar later
- The act of writing/typing helps with memorization

**Black Letter Law:**
- Professor will provide all black letter law needed
- Given slowly for students to write down
- Writing/typing aids memorization (proven by studies)
- Do not need to buy study guides

### Essay Writing

**Grading Emphasis:**
- Great emphasis on correct statement of law
- Must write black letter law correctly on bar exam

**Academic Support:**
- Friday academic support classes available
- Can submit essays for grading
- Free if not taking for units
- Essay writing and MBE practice available

### Language and Grammar

**Importance for Lawyers:**
- Language is the art of lawyers
- Front and center of what lawyers do
- Misspelling and grammar errors reflect poorly
- Judges judge attorneys by grammatical skills

**Common Mistakes:**
- Cannot = one word (not two words: "can not")
- No such thing as "close proximity" (proximity means close)
- "Very unique" is wrong (unique cannot be modified)
- Effect vs. affect

**Latin Terms:**
- Latin is the language of law (Lex = law)
- Learn Latin legal terms
- Gives advantage in court
- **Res ipsa loquitur** = "The thing speaks for itself"
- Recommend: Watch "Latin for Lawyers" on YouTube
- Use Latin in court to establish authority and potentially intimidate opponents

### Case Analysis Tips

**Check Case Year and Jurisdiction:**
- **California cases:** Pay close attention - California leads in legal innovation
- California Supreme Court cases: Really pay attention
- Cases from other jurisdictions: May be included for pedagogical purposes only
- Look at historical development (some cases go back to 14th century)

**California Legal Leadership:**
- Sexual harassment originated in California
- Intentional infliction of emotional distress originated in California
- Negligent infliction of emotional distress originated in California
- Every good legal development happens in California first
