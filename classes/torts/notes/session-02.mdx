# I. Introduction to Tort Liability

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Purpose of Tort Law:** To make the plaintiff "whole again"[cite: 42].
* [cite_start]**Remedy:** The primary tool available to the jury is monetary compensation[cite: 43].
* [cite_start]**Fault-Based System:** Torts is a fault-based system of recovery[cite: 53]. There are three pathways to prove fault:
    1.  [cite_start]**Intentional Torts:** The defendant acted intentionally[cite: 55].
    2.  [cite_start]**Negligence:** The defendant's conduct fell below the standard of care[cite: 57, 149].
    3.  [cite_start]**Strict Liability:** Liability without a showing of fault, usually reserved for abnormally dangerous activities [cite: 59-60].

### 2. Key Cases
* **Spano (New York Case):**
    * [cite_start]**Facts:** Involved damage caused by blasting (dynamite)[cite: 680].
    * **Rule/Holding:** Illustrates **Strict Liability**. [cite_start]If a defendant engages in an "abnormally dangerous activity" (like blasting or owning a crocodile), they are liable for resulting injuries regardless of fault or care taken [cite: 680-689]. [cite_start]The policy is about who bears the cost of the damage: the person who engaged in the dangerous activity or the innocent neighbor [cite: 753-755].

# II. Intent

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
To prove an intentional tort, one must establish **Intent**. Intent is divided into two categories:
* [cite_start]**Specific Intent:** An actor intends the consequences of his conduct if his **goal** is to bring about those consequences [cite: 89-91].
* [cite_start]**General Intent:** An actor intends the consequences of his conduct if he knows with **substantial certainty** that those consequences will occur [cite: 107-111].
    * [cite_start]*Note:* "Substantial certainty" is a high threshold; it is not merely "should have known" (which is negligence) [cite: 138-140, 146].

### 2. Key Cases
* **Garratt v. Dailey (1955):**
    * [cite_start]**Facts:** Brian, a 5-year-old child, pulled a lawn chair out from under the plaintiff as she was sitting [cite: 768-769].
    * **Rule/Holding:** **Intent $\neq$ Malice.** Intent does not require a desire to injure, "ill will," or bad motive. [cite_start]It only requires a volitional act performed with the purpose (specific intent) or substantial certainty (general intent) that contact would occur [cite: 798-804]. [cite_start]The court found that if the child knew with substantial certainty the plaintiff would hit the ground, he acted with intent [cite: 825-826].
* **Wagner (2005):**
    * [cite_start]**Facts:** Plaintiff was attacked in a K-Mart by a mentally disabled man being supervised by state employees [cite: 832-834].
    * [cite_start]**Rule/Holding:** Intent only requires the intent to make contact, not the intent to cause *offense* or *harm* [cite: 838-839].

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples
* **The Cane Fight:** Two dogs fight; owner tries to separate them with a cane and accidentally hits a person.
    * *Analysis:* Did he have the *goal* to hit the person? (No = No Specific Intent). Did he know with *substantial certainty* he would hit the person? (Likely No = No General Intent). [cite_start]If no intent is proven, the theory of recovery shifts to **Negligence** [cite: 46-47, 114-116].
* **Texting and Driving:** A driver texts and rear-ends another car.
    * *Analysis:* This is generally **Negligence**, not an intentional tort. [cite_start]While the act of texting was voluntary, the driver did not know with *substantial certainty* that an accident would occur [cite: 142-143].

# III. Battery

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Definition:** Battery is an intentional act that causes a harmful or offensive touching of the plaintiff's person [cite: 218-221].
* **Prima Facie Elements:**
    1.  [cite_start]**Intent:** (Specific or General)[cite: 233].
    2.  [cite_start]**Act:** Must be a **Volitional Act** (conscious/willed movement) [cite: 273-282].
    3.  [cite_start]**Causation:** The act must cause the result[cite: 236].
    4.  [cite_start]**Harmful or Offensive Touching:** Measured by a **Reasonable Person Standard**[cite: 321, 353].
    5.  [cite_start]**Plaintiff's Person:** Includes anything **intimately connected** to the plaintiff's body [cite: 359-360].
* [cite_start]**Damages:** Damages are **not** a prima facie element of battery; a plaintiff does not need to prove injury to recover (unlike negligence)[cite: 392, 415].

### 2. Key Cases
* **Cohen v. Petty:**
    * **Facts:** Driver fainted while driving, causing an accident. [cite_start]He had no history of fainting [cite: 474-477].
    * **Rule/Holding:** **The Act must be Volitional.** Fainting or a seizure is not a volitional act. [cite_start]Therefore, there is no liability for battery or negligence unless the defendant knew of a history of fainting (which would be negligence/recklessness) [cite: 481-489].
* **McGuire v. Almy (1937):**
    * [cite_start]**Facts:** A mentally ill patient struck a nurse with a furniture leg[cite: 931, 971].
    * [cite_start]**Rule/Holding:** **Mental Illness does not negate Intent.** A mentally ill person is liable for intentional torts if they are capable of forming the requisite intent (e.g., intent to strike), regardless of the delusion or motivation behind it [cite: 979-982].

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples
* **The Tie Yank:** Defendant grabs Plaintiff's tie or flips their hat.
    * *Analysis:* Even if the Defendant never touches the Plaintiff's skin, the tie/hat is "intimately connected" to the person. [cite_start]This satisfies the touching element of battery [cite: 332-338].
* **Shoulder Tap:** Tapping someone on the shoulder to ask for directions.
    * [cite_start]*Analysis:* Even if the specific plaintiff is offended (e.g., "I am the King of England"), this is **not** battery because a **Reasonable Person** would not find it offensive [cite: 317-323].

# IV. Assault

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Definition:** Assault is an intentional act that places the plaintiff in the **imminent apprehension** of a harmful or offensive touching [cite: 1169-1172].
* **Prima Facie Elements:**
    1.  [cite_start]Intent[cite: 1399].
    2.  [cite_start]Act (Overt)[cite: 1399].
    3.  [cite_start]Causation[cite: 1400].
    4.  [cite_start]Imminent Apprehension[cite: 1400].
    5.  [cite_start]Of a Harmful/Offensive Touching[cite: 1400].
* [cite_start]**Apparent Ability:** The defendant's **apparent ability** to commit the battery is sufficient; actual ability is not required (e.g., an unloaded gun can cause assault if the plaintiff doesn't know it is unloaded) [cite: 1185-1189].
* **Words Alone:** Words alone are **insufficient** to constitute assault. [cite_start]They must be accompanied by an **overt act** [cite: 1190, 1237-1238].
* [cite_start]**Immediacy:** The apprehended contact must be immediate; future threats do not constitute assault [cite: 1258-1260].

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples
* **The Unloaded Gun:** Pointing an unloaded gun at someone who believes it is loaded.
    * [cite_start]*Analysis:* This is assault because the plaintiff has a reasonable apprehension of imminent harm based on **apparent ability** [cite: 1179-1189].
* **Future Threat:** "I am going to hit you tomorrow."
    * [cite_start]*Analysis:* Not assault because the threat is not **immediate**[cite: 1260].
* **Raised Fist:** Saying "I am going to hit you" while raising a fist.
    * *Analysis:* This creates assault. [cite_start]The words alone are insufficient, but the words **accompanied by the overt act** (raising the fist) create imminent apprehension [cite: 1239-1240].

# V. False Imprisonment

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Definition:** False imprisonment is an intentional act or omission to act (where there is a duty to act) that **confines or restrains** the plaintiff to a **bounded area** [cite: 1289-1293].
* [cite_start]**Awareness:** The plaintiff must generally be **aware** of the confinement at the time it occurs [cite: 1355-1356].
* **Methods of Confinement:**
    1.  [cite_start]**Physical Barriers:** Locking a door[cite: 1302].
    2.  [cite_start]**Physical Force:** Grabbing a wrist or coat[cite: 1306].
    3.  [cite_start]**Threat of Force:** Directed at the plaintiff or a loved one (e.g., "Don't move or I'll shoot") [cite: 1311-1317].
    4.  [cite_start]**Failure to Provide Escape:** Specifically where there is an affirmative duty to do so [cite: 1341-1342].

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples
* **The Locked Sleeper:** A person is locked in a room while asleep and wakes up after the door is unlocked, never knowing they were trapped.
    * [cite_start]*Analysis:* Generally not false imprisonment because there was no **awareness of confinement** [cite: 1353-1360].
* **The Immigrant (Omission):** An immigrant on a boat (Ellis Island era) is refused permission to leave the boat despite a promise/duty to let them ashore.
    * [cite_start]*Analysis:* This constitutes an **omission to act** where there is a duty, satisfying the element for false imprisonment [cite: 1323-1330].

# VI. Nuance & Policy

* **Civil vs. Criminal Law:** There is a "firewall" between civil torts and criminal law. Do not try to reconcile the definitions (e.g., "Guilt" vs. "Liability"). [cite_start]They are distinct systems with different rules [cite: 1140-1155].
* **Insanity Defense:** The insanity defense (a criminal law concept) does not apply to intentional torts. [cite_start]Society has determined that mentally ill persons are liable for their torts to ensure victims are compensated [cite: 982-990].
* **Sovereign Immunity:** Under common law, one could not sue the government ("The King"). [cite_start]Modern law retains this but allows for waivers (e.g., suing the state under specific statutes), often requiring procedural steps like filing a claim within 6 months [cite: 898-915].
