# Property - Session 13 Notes

## Landlord-Tenant Law Overview

### I. Constructive Eviction

#### A. Elements of Constructive Eviction

**Three Essential Elements:**

1. **Substantial Interference**
   - Must be significant or substantial interference with tenant's use and enjoyment
   - Measured **objectively** (reasonable person standard), not subjectively
   - Examples of substantial interference:
     - Broken locks
     - No heating or gas
     - No hot water
     - Roach or rodent infestations
     - Leaks
     - Electrical issues
     - Noise problems
     - Toxic mold
   - Minor issues typically insufficient (e.g., single moth in closet)

2. **Notice to Landlord**
   - Tenant must provide landlord notice of the issue
   - Landlord cannot cure problems they don't know about
   - Tenant must give landlord **reasonable time to cure** the problem
   - What constitutes "reasonable time" is case-by-case
     - Emergency situations (overflowing toilet) vs. non-emergency (single mouse)
   - Failure to give notice = constructive eviction claim fails
   - If tenant leaves before allowing reasonable cure time, claim fails

3. **Vacate the Premises**
   - Tenant **must vacate** the property
   - Cannot claim constructive eviction while still occupying premises
   - Rationale: If condition is truly uninhabitable, tenant would be forced to leave
   - Tenant leaves on their own based on landlord's omissions

**Important Note:** Constructive eviction discussion is typically brief - don't over-write the vacate element.

#### B. Relationship to Abandonment

- Landlord will often claim abandonment when tenant vacates
- Tenant's response: justified departure due to constructive eviction
- If constructively evicted, tenant's obligation to pay rent is extinguished
- Abandonment is arguable when constructive eviction is contested

#### C. Constructive Eviction vs. Habitability

- Can incorporate habitability issues
- Same facts may raise both constructive eviction AND implied warranty of habitability
- Two separate discussions required
- Example: Toxic mold could support both claims

---

### II. Illegal Lease

#### A. Definition and Requirements

**An illegal lease is based on violation of housing code at the inception of the lease**

- If city issues order that property is not habitable, landlord cannot rent it
- Leasing property in violation of housing code = illegal lease
- Illegal lease is **unenforceable**

#### B. Timing Is Critical

- Issue must exist **at inception** of lease
- If problem arises **after** lease begins, illegal lease does not apply
- Post-inception problems may be habitability issues instead

#### C. Examples of Illegal Leases

- Lease for purposes of cooking methamphetamine
- Lease for running prostitution ring
- Any lease premised on illegal activity
- Lease of property under housing code violation order

**Note:** If activity is illegal but landlord unaware (no meeting of minds), lease may not be illegal

---

### III. Implied Warranty of Habitability

**Very commonly tested - expect this on exams**

#### A. Basic Principles

- Applies **only to residential leases** (NOT commercial)
- Is **implied** in every residential lease (need not be in writing)
- Landlord **cannot waive** habitability protections (public policy)
- Protects tenant's right to premises suitable for ordinary residential use

#### B. Key Question

**Is the premises habitable for ordinary residential use?**

#### C. Effect on Tenant's Obligations

- Uninhabitable premises **excuses tenant from paying rent**
- **No requirement to vacate** (unlike constructive eviction)
- Tenant may remain on premises and refuse rent payments

#### D. Analysis Requirements

**Must show:**
1. How the condition is a habitability issue
2. How it affects the **entire premises** to deem it uninhabitable
3. Objective standard applies (reasonable person)

**Common exam mistakes:**
- Identifying habitability issue but failing to explain impact on entire premises
- Vague fact patterns require analysis of whether issue rises to uninhabitability level

#### E. Examples of Habitability Issues

**Clear habitability concerns:**
- Toxic mold (sanitary issue)
- Rat/rodent infestations
- Non-functioning toilet (only toilet in unit)
- No electricity
- No hot water
- Broken locks (California law recognizes as habitability issue)

**Questionable/arguable issues:**
- Broken elevator (generally not habitability, but could be if wheelchair-bound tenant cannot access unit)
- One non-working toilet in multi-bathroom unit
- Ants in kitchen (minor, tenant could spray/wipe)
- "Sometimes" non-working toilet (vague - requires analysis)

**NOT habitability issues:**
- Broken elevator (general annoyance)
- Issues that are merely inconvenient vs. sanitary/safety concerns

#### F. Scope of "Entire Premises"

- "Premises" = the unit being rented, not entire apartment complex
- Must affect tenant's specific rental unit

#### G. Tenant's Remedies for Habitability Issues

1. **Refuse to pay rent**
2. **Remedy defect and offset cost against rent**
   - Example: $5,000/month apartment with mold
   - Tenant pays $1,000 to remove mold
   - Following month, tenant pays only $4,000
3. **Defend against eviction**

#### H. Exam Tips

- Constructive eviction can exist without habitability discussion (100%)
- Sometimes both doctrines coincide
- Don't write "same as above" after constructive eviction discussion
- Habitability requires different analysis:
  - Focus on sanitary issues, not mere annoyances
  - Explain impact on entire premises
  - Address whether reasonable person would find uninhabitable

---

### IV. Retaliatory Eviction

#### A. Definition

- Occurs when landlord retaliates against tenant for reporting violations
- Landlord punishes tenant for exercising legal rights

#### B. Elements

1. **Tenant reports problem** (to city, housing authority, etc.)
2. **Landlord takes adverse action** in response
   - Raising rent
   - Refusing to renew lease
   - Other punishments

#### C. Presumptions

**Statutory Presumptions (0-180 days depending on jurisdiction):**
- If landlord increases rent within 90-180 days after tenant reports violation
- Presumption that action is retaliatory
- Presumption can be rebutted
- Some jurisdictions: 90 days
- Other jurisdictions: up to 180 days

#### D. Public Policy

- Law encourages tenants to report problems
- Landlord cannot silence "whistleblowers"
- Retaliatory eviction violates public policy

#### E. Consequences

- Lease can be canceled
- Tenant protected from retaliation

---

### V. Tort Liability (Premises Liability)

**NOT TESTED in Property course**

- Covered in Torts 2
- Deals with injuries on premises
- Who is liable: landlord or tenant?
- Involves invitee/licensee/trespasser distinctions
- Professor will never test this because not all students have taken Torts 2

---

### VI. Fixtures

**Definition:** A chattel (personal property) that becomes affixed to the realty

#### A. Basic Rule

**When tenant installs fixture, does it become part of realty (landlord's property)?**

#### B. Test for Fixtures

**Two-part inquiry:**
1. **Is the chattel affixed to the property?**
2. **Did tenant intend for it to become part of the realty?**

Intent is determined by:
- Nature of the item itself
- Whether item is typically transient
- Combination of objective intent and actual installation

#### C. Examples of Fixtures

**Likely to be fixtures (remain landlord's property):**
- Water heater (affixed via plumbing)
- Carpet (installed, not area rug)
- Wallpaper
- High-tech toilet bolted down (even $8,000 Japanese toilet)
- Rose garden planted in ground
- Solar panels attached to house
- Security system (if permanently installed)

**Analysis considerations:**
- Is item typically transient?
- Toilets are not typically taken from place to place
- Carpet is installed (vs. area rug which is movable)
- Intent shown by permanent installation

#### D. Trade Fixtures (Commercial Exception)

**Special rule for commercial leases:**
- Machinery/equipment installed for business operations
- May be removed if:
  1. Removed upon termination of lease
  2. Do not cause significant damage to realty
- Recognizes transient nature of business operations
- Example: Manufacturing equipment in warehouse

**Important:** Trade fixtures apply to commercial leases only, NOT residential

#### E. Remedies for Fixture Disputes

- If tenant removes fixture improperly, landlord can sue for:
  - Return of the item
  - Replacement cost
  - Damages resulting from removal

#### F. Exam Considerations

- If facts mention installation of items, consider fixture analysis
- Discuss whether item affixed and intended to become part of realty
- Address whether item is typically transient
- If price mentioned (e.g., $8,000 toilet), still likely fixture if affixed

---

### VII. Duty to Repair

#### A. General Rule

- Tenant has **no obligation** to make significant repairs
- Tenant **not responsible** for ordinary wear and tear

#### B. Tenant's Responsibilities

**Tenant must repair if:**
- Damage caused by tenant's own actions
- Example: Knife going through wall during knife fight

#### C. Relationship to Other Doctrines

- Consider duty to repair when discussing:
  - Constructive eviction issues
  - Habitability issues
- Analysis: Is damage significant enough to require landlord repair?
- Or is it minor enough for tenant to handle?

---

### VIII. Waste

**Same rules of waste apply to landlord-tenant as to other property interests**

#### A. Tenant Cannot Commit Waste

- Cannot damage the property
- Cannot change character of property
- Cannot be negligent
- Cannot be a hoarder
- Cannot spray paint walls

#### B. Types of Waste

- Voluntary waste
- Permissive waste
- (Same framework as discussed earlier in semester)

---

## Case Law

### IX. Delivery of Possession

#### **Hanan v. Dusch** (Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, 1930)

**Facts:**
- Hanan rented property from Dusch beginning January 1, 1928
- Prior tenant still occupying when Hanan tried to move in
- Hanan sued, claiming landlord must deliver vacant possession

**Issue:** Does landlord have implied duty to deliver actual possession at lease commencement?

**Rules - Two Competing Views:**

1. **English Rule (Majority View):**
   - Landlord must deliver both legal AND actual possession
   - Landlord responsible for removing holdover tenants
   - More protective of incoming tenant

2. **American Rule (Minority View):**
   - Landlord only required to provide **legal right to possession**
   - NOT responsible for delivering actual physical possession
   - Tenant's burden to remove holdover occupants
   - Rationale: Unfair to hold landlord responsible for third party wrongdoing

**Holding:** Court adopted American Rule - affirmed for Dusch

**Analysis:**
- This case applies specifically to **holdover tenants** (prior tenants refusing to leave)
- Tenant has ability to include provision in lease requiring landlord to remove holdovers
- If not in lease, law doesn't require it under American Rule

**Modern Application:**
- English Rule believed to be majority view in most jurisdictions
- American Rule creates burden on incoming tenant
- Better reasoned view: Landlord should remove prior tenant (it's their property)

**Exam Application:**
- If holdover tenant issue arises, discuss both rules
- English Rule: Landlord must provide actual possession
- American Rule: Only legal possession required

---

### X. Assignment vs. Sublease

#### **Ernst v. Conditt** (Tennessee Court of Appeals, 1964)

**Facts:**
- Ernst (landlord) leased lot to Rogers for 1 year with renewal option
- Lease required written consent for any transfer
- Rogers built go-kart track business
- Rogers wanted to sell business to Conditt
- Ernst approved transfer only after Rogers guaranteed rent if Conditt defaulted
- Agreement stated Rogers "**sublet**" premises to Conditt for remainder of term
- Rogers waived all right of reentry or control
- Conditt took possession, paid rent directly to Ernst
- Conditt failed to pay rent and abandoned property
- Ernst sued Conditt for unpaid rent

**Issue:** Was transfer a sublease or assignment?

**Rule:** Courts look to **intent of parties and surrounding circumstances**, not merely labels used

**Key Factors Indicating Assignment:**

1. **Exclusive possession for entire remainder of term** (defining feature)
2. **Rent paid directly to landlord** (Ernst), not to intermediate party (Rogers)
3. **Rogers retained no right of reentry**
4. **Rogers sold entire business** to Conditt (showed no intent to return)
5. **Conditt remained in possession even after original lease expired**

**Holding:** Transaction constituted **assignment**, not sublease

**Analysis:**
- Label "sublease" in document NOT controlling
- Court examines:
  - Intent from instrument as a whole
  - Parties' conduct
  - Legal effect, not name
- Rogers' promise to remain liable for rent = surety agreement, NOT reversionary interest
- Conditt in privity of estate with Ernst, personally liable for rent

**Important Distinctions:**

**Assignment:**
- Transfer of **entire remaining interest**
- All durational interest transferred
- Landlord can sue both original tenant AND assignee
- Privity of estate between landlord and assignee

**Sublease:**
- Transfer of **less than entire interest**
- Original tenant retains reversionary interest
- Sublessee pays rent to original tenant (not landlord)
- Original tenant then pays landlord

**Exam Tips:**
- Don't rely solely on labels ("sublease" vs. "assignment")
- Analyze duration of transfer
- Follow the rent payments
- Look for intent to return to premises
- Sale of business suggests no intent to return = assignment

---

### XI. Consent to Assignment

#### **Kendall v. Ernst Pestana, Inc.** (California Supreme Court, 1985)

**Facts:**
- Bixler leased commercial hangar space in San Jose (1969, 25-year lease)
- Lease assigned to Ernst Pestana (became landlord)
- Bixler subleased to Kendall (plaintiffs) for aviation service business
- Sublease included clause: "Sublessee shall not assign or sublet without written consent"
- Plaintiffs sought to sell business (including sublease) to new buyer
- Pestana refused consent UNLESS:
  - Rent increased
  - Other concessions granted
- No evidence proposed assignee was unfit or would breach lease
- Trial court and Court of Appeals sided with Pestana

**Issue:** May commercial landlord **arbitrarily withhold consent** to assignment when lease requires consent but doesn't specify standard?

**Two Competing Views:**

1. **Majority Rule (Traditional Common Law):**
   - Landlord can arbitrarily and unreasonably refuse consent
   - No requirement of good faith
   - Can deny for any reason or no reason
   - Examples: "I don't like Sarah," "I don't like Alex"

2. **Minority Rule (California's Approach):**
   - Landlord may NOT unreasonably withhold consent
   - Implied covenant of good faith applies
   - Must have legitimate reason for denial
   - Purely economic motivation insufficient

**Holding:** California Supreme Court adopted **Minority Rule** (reversed lower courts)

**Rationale for Minority Rule:**

1. **Contract Principles:**
   - Modern commercial leases are contracts, not merely conveyances
   - Should be governed by good faith principles
   - Landlord cannot act capriciously

2. **Policy Against Restraints on Alienation:**
   - Promotes free transferability of property
   - Allows business transfers and sales

3. **Economic Reality:**
   - Business transfers, sales, and absorptions common in commerce
   - Should be facilitated, not arbitrarily blocked

4. **Restatement (Second) Support:**
   - Modern trend recognizes reasonableness requirement

**Application to Facts:**
- Pestana's refusal purely economic (wanted higher rent)
- No legitimate concern about assignee's capabilities
- No concern about use of property
- Refusal unreasonable and unenforceable

**Important Limitations:**

**Applies to:** Commercial leases (explicit in holding)

**Unclear:** Whether applies to residential leases
- Court note 17 (page 508): "We are presented only with commercial lease, therefore do not address whether residential leases controlled by these principles"
- As of decision, unclear if extends to residential

**Practical Effects:**

Under Minority Rule:
- Landlord still gets multiple parties liable (original tenant + assignee)
- Transfer still requires consent
- Consent just cannot be unreasonably withheld
- Landlord must act in good faith with legitimate reason

Under Majority Rule:
- Landlord can arbitrarily deny
- Holds tenant to original lease
- No requirement of reasonableness

**Exam Application:**
- Discuss both majority and minority rules
- Majority: Arbitrary denial permitted
- Minority (California commercial): Good faith required, must be reasonable
- Note: California follows minority view
- Analyze whether denial reasonable under facts
- Consider: Was denial based on legitimate business concern or pure economics?

## Casebook Review - Leaseholds

### XII. Types of Leaseholds (p. 471-472)

#### A. Term of Years
**Rule:** Estate lasting for fixed period of time OR period computable by formula fixing calendar dates for beginning and ending

#### B. Periodic Tenancy
**Rule:** Lease for fixed duration that continues for succeeding periods until landlord or tenant gives notice of termination

#### C. Tenancy at Will
**Rule:** Tenancy of no fixed period enduring so long as both landlord and tenant desire

**Important:** Giving tenant sole power to terminate could create life estate

#### D. Tenancy at Sufferance (p. 474)
**Rule:** Arises when tenant remains in possession (holds over) after termination of tenancy

---

### XIII. Statute of Frauds (p. 477)

**General Rule:** Leases for **more than one year must be in writing**

- Based on English Statute of Frauds (17th century)
- Prevents fraud in lease transactions
- American statutes commonly require writing for leases exceeding one year

**Exam Consideration:**
- If lease term is year-to-year by phone = fails statute of frauds
- Defaults to periodic tenancy (month-to-month based on rent payment schedule)
- May discuss both as term of years (if in writing) and periodic (if statute of frauds fails)
- Professor accepts either approach on exams

---

### XIV. Discrimination (p. 478)

**NOT heavily tested - Constitutional Law issue**

- Landlord cannot discriminate based on:
  - Race
  - Religion
  - National origin
  - Sex
  - Family status
  - Sexual orientation
- High standard of review for race, religion, national origin
- Intermediate scrutiny for sex and family status
- Equal Protection issue (Constitutional Law)

**Professor's Note:** Will not test because this overlaps with Constitutional Law, which not all students have taken

---

### XV. Privity (p. 507, Note 2)

**In Assignment Context:**

**Privity of Estate:**
- Exists between landlord and assignee
- Assignee directly liable to landlord for rent
- Landlord can sue BOTH:
  - Original tenant (privity of contract)
  - Assignee (privity of estate)

**Landlord Preference:**
- Landlords prefer assignments over subleases
- Assignments give landlord two parties on the hook for rent

**In Sublease Context:**
- No privity between landlord and sublessee
- Sublessee pays original tenant
- Original tenant pays landlord
- Landlord can only sue original tenant, not sublessee

---

## Key Exam Tips & Takeaways

1. **Constructive Eviction:** Three elements (substantial interference + notice with reasonable cure time + vacate). Keep vacate discussion brief.

2. **Habitability:** Very commonly tested. Applies ONLY to residential leases. Cannot be waived. Tenant need not vacate. Must explain how condition makes ENTIRE premises uninhabitable.

3. **Constructive Eviction vs. Habitability:** Can discuss both for same facts. Don't write "same as above." Different analyses required.

4. **Retaliatory Eviction:** Look for tenant reporting + landlord punishment. Presumption if within 90-180 days.

5. **Fixtures:** Affixed + intent to become part of realty = landlord's property. Consider whether typically transient.

6. **Assignment vs. Sublease:** Ignore labels. Look at: (1) duration of transfer, (2) who pays rent to whom, (3) intent to return, (4) sale of business.

7. **Consent to Assignment:**
   - Majority: Can arbitrarily deny
   - Minority (California commercial): Must be reasonable and good faith

8. **Illegal Lease:** Must be illegal at inception, not after lease begins.

9. **Waste & Duty to Repair:** Same rules apply as elsewhere in property law.

10. **Final Exam Hints:** Professor indicated one definite hint dropped this session - pay attention to topics emphasized and examples given (e.g., Japanese toilet, fixtures, habitability).
