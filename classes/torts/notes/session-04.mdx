# Mistake and Intent

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* **The Rule of Mistake:** Mistake does not negate intent.
    * [cite_start]If a defendant intends to do an act (e.g., fire a gun, enter land), the fact that they were mistaken about the target or ownership does not relieve them of liability[cite: 115, 116, 120, 146].
    * **Motive vs. Intent:** Motive is irrelevant to intent. [cite_start]The plaintiff does not need to prove the defendant intended to commit the specific tort (e.g., kill the dog); they only need to prove the defendant intended the volitional act (e.g., discharge the firearm)[cite: 148, 150, 152].

### 2. Key Cases
* [cite_start]**Case Name:** *Ranson v. Kitner* (1889) [cite: 60, 101]
    * [cite_start]**Facts:** Hunters intended to shoot a wolf but legally shot the plaintiff's dog by mistake[cite: 110, 114].
    * **Holding:** The defendants were liable for the value of the dog. [cite_start]Their mistake regarding the identity of the animal did not negate their intent to shoot[cite: 120, 146].

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples
* **Trespass to Chattel/Conversion:** If A takes B’s phone by mistake, thinking it is A's own phone, A is still liable for Trespass to Chattel (minor interference) or Conversion (major interference). [cite_start]The mistake does not excuse the intent to take the object[cite: 122, 123, 124].
* **Battery:** If A slaps B thinking B is a friend, but B is a stranger, A is liable for battery. [cite_start]A intended the contact; the mistake regarding identity is irrelevant[cite: 205, 206, 208].

# Battery (Extension to Person)

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Definition:** Battery is an intentional act that causes a harmful or offensive touching of the plaintiff's person[cite: 214, 215].
* [cite_start]**The "Touching" Element:** Touching includes contact with items **intimately connected** to the plaintiff's person such that they constitute an invasion of bodily integrity[cite: 328, 329, 371].

### 2. Key Cases
* [cite_start]**Case Name:** *Fisher v. Carrousel Motor Hotel* (1967) [cite: 228, 233]
    * **Facts:** A restaurant manager snatched a plate from an African American patron's hand while shouting an insult. [cite_start]The manager did not touch the patron's skin[cite: 238, 239].
    * **Holding:** The snatching of the plate constituted a battery. [cite_start]The plate was intimately connected to the plaintiff, satisfying the touching element[cite: 334, 335].

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples
* [cite_start]**Clothing:** Pulling a tie, flipping a cap, or grabbing a coat constitutes battery because these items are intimately connected to the person[cite: 247, 318, 331, 333].

# Assault

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Definition:** An intentional act that places the plaintiff in **imminent apprehension** of a harmful or offensive touching[cite: 216].
* **Apparent Ability:** The plaintiff need only demonstrate that the defendant had the **apparent ability** to bring about harmful contact. [cite_start]Actual ability is not required[cite: 471, 472, 501].
* [cite_start]**Words Alone:** Words alone are insufficient to constitute assault[cite: 490, 716].

### 2. Key Cases
* [cite_start]**Case Name:** *Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Hill* [cite: 372]
    * **Facts:** An employee, smelling of whiskey, reached across a counter toward a female customer and made indecent suggestions. [cite_start]The counter was wide enough that he arguably could not actually reach her[cite: 433, 435, 436].
    * **Holding:** The defendant was liable for assault. [cite_start]The width of the counter did not matter; the defendant had the *apparent ability* to touch the plaintiff[cite: 472, 474].

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples
* **Unloaded Gun:** If a defendant points an empty gun at the plaintiff, it is an assault. [cite_start]Even though the defendant lacks the *actual* ability to shoot, they have the *apparent* ability to cause harm[cite: 477, 482].
* [cite_start]**Threats:** A person stating they will beat the plaintiff up (without physical action) is not assault because words alone are insufficient[cite: 487, 490].

# False Imprisonment

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Definition:** An intentional act (or omission where there is a duty to act) that confines or restrains the plaintiff to a bounded area[cite: 530, 550].
* **Awareness Requirement:** **Awareness of confinement** is a requisite for false imprisonment. [cite_start]If the plaintiff is unaware they are confined, there is no liability (unless harmed)[cite: 552, 556, 603].
* **Methods of Confinement:**
    * [cite_start]Includes physical barriers, physical force, threat of force, or failure to provide means of escape when there is a duty to do so[cite: 624, 625].
    * [cite_start]**Moral Persuasion:** Moral persuasion is **not** sufficient to constitute force or threat of force for confinement[cite: 616, 619].
* **Bounded Area:** The area must be bounded. [cite_start]Exclusion (not letting someone *in*) is not false imprisonment[cite: 570, 576].

### 2. Key Cases
* [cite_start]**Case Name:** *Big Town Nursing Home* [cite: 513, 514]
    * [cite_start]**Facts:** Plaintiff resident was refused permission to leave, denied access to a phone, and locked in a ward[cite: 525, 526].
    * [cite_start]**Holding:** False imprisonment established because the plaintiff was restrained against his will[cite: 531].
* [cite_start]**Case Name:** *Parvi v. City of Kingston* (Discussed in context of police/drunk brothers) [cite: 587]
    * **Facts:** Police took intoxicated brothers to an abandoned golf course/highway instead of arresting them. Plaintiff wandered onto a highway and was hit. [cite_start]Plaintiff had no recollection of the night[cite: 593, 595, 597].
    * **Holding:** Awareness of confinement is an essential element. [cite_start]If the plaintiff was too intoxicated to be aware of the confinement at the time, there is no false imprisonment claim (though negligence might apply)[cite: 603].
* [cite_start]**Case Name:** *Hardy v. LaBelle's Distributing Co.* [cite: 606]
    * **Facts:** Employee accused of stealing a watch was asked to stay in an office for questioning. [cite_start]She was not threatened with force and passed a lie detector test[cite: 607, 610, 613].
    * **Holding:** No false imprisonment. [cite_start]The plaintiff stayed due to "moral persuasion" (desire to clear her name), which is not a sufficient method of confinement[cite: 618, 619].
* [cite_start]**Case Name:** *Enright v. Groves* [cite: 637, 638]
    * [cite_start]**Facts:** Police officer arrested a woman for a dog-leash violation because she refused to show her driver's license (which she was not legally required to produce)[cite: 638, 641, 658].
    * **Holding:** False imprisonment (false arrest). The arrest was unlawful because it was based on the failure to produce a license, not the ordinance violation. [cite_start]Conviction of a crime is usually a defense, but the arrest itself must be lawful[cite: 660, 661].

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples
* [cite_start]**Large Area:** Being confined to a large estate (several hundred acres) is still false imprisonment if the plaintiff cannot leave the grounds[cite: 537, 539].
* [cite_start]**Voluntary Entry:** Entering a room voluntarily does not negate false imprisonment if the defendant subsequently refuses to let the plaintiff leave[cite: 541, 543].
* **Luxury:** Being locked in a luxurious suite (e.g., Waldorf Astoria) is still false imprisonment. [cite_start]The quality of accommodations only affects **damages**, not liability[cite: 560, 565, 567].
* [cite_start]**Exclusion:** Refusing to let a student enter a campus is not false imprisonment; the plaintiff is not confined to a bounded area[cite: 570, 576].

# Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress (IIED)

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Definition:** An intentional act by the defendant that is **extreme and outrageous conduct** that causes the plaintiff to suffer **severe emotional distress**[cite: 773, 787].
* [cite_start]**Extreme and Outrageous Conduct:** Conduct that transcends all bounds of decency tolerated by a civilized society[cite: 781, 788].
    * [cite_start]**Insults:** Mere insulting language is insufficient *unless* there is a special relationship (Common Carrier, Innkeeper) or the defendant exploits a known sensitivity (e.g., weak heart)[cite: 789, 867, 876].
* **Severe Emotional Distress:** The plaintiff must suffer *severe* distress, not merely "mere" distress. [cite_start]Severity is a prima facie element, unlike in other torts where it only goes to damages[cite: 808, 812, 941, 943].
* **Purpose:** IIED is a "gap filler" tort. [cite_start]It should only be used when the plaintiff suffers **pure emotional distress** without another underlying tort (like battery)[cite: 850, 856, 860, 991].

### 2. Key Cases
* [cite_start]**Case Name:** *State Rubbish Collectors Ass'n v. Siliznoff* [cite: 703, 736]
    * **Facts:** A rubbish collector was threatened by association members (Sopranos-style) regarding business territory. [cite_start]Threats were for future action[cite: 734, 736, 740].
    * **Holding:** Recognized the new tort of IIED. Previously, threats of *future* harm were not actionable as assault. [cite_start]This case filled the gap for pure emotional distress caused by extreme threats[cite: 743, 749, 750].
* [cite_start]**Case Name:** *Slocum v. Food Fair Stores of Florida* [cite: 823]
    * **Facts:** Store employee told a customer, "You stink to me." [cite_start]Customer sued for IIED[cite: 824].
    * **Holding:** The insults caused only "mere" emotional distress, not "severe." [cite_start]Insulting language alone is not extreme and outrageous[cite: 827, 828].
* [cite_start]**Case Name:** *Harris v. Jones* [cite: 926]
    * [cite_start]**Facts:** Supervisor mocked the plaintiff's stutter[cite: 927, 930].
    * **Holding:** No IIED liability because the plaintiff failed to prove the emotional distress was **severe**. [cite_start]Severity is a prima facie element[cite: 941].
* [cite_start]**Case Name:** *Taylor v. Vallelunga* (Bystander IIED) [cite: 968, 981]
    * **Facts:** Daughter watched her father get beaten up. [cite_start]The defendant did not know the daughter was present[cite: 981, 1112].
    * **Holding:** No liability. To recover as a bystander, the plaintiff must prove the defendant **intended** to cause the bystander severe emotional distress.
    * **Bystander Intent Rule:** To prove intent, the bystander generally must show:
        1.  Plaintiff was present.
        2.  Plaintiff is a close relative of the injured party.
        3.  [cite_start]Defendant **knew** the plaintiff was present and a close relative[cite: 1101, 1106, 1110, 1146].

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples
* **Battery vs. IIED:** If A breaks B's arm, B sues for Battery. B recovers for pain and suffering (emotional distress) under the Battery claim. [cite_start]B does not need to sue for IIED[cite: 857, 858, 895].
* [cite_start]**Known Sensitivity:** If A knows B has a heart condition and scares them intentionally to cause an attack, this constitutes IIED[cite: 876, 879].

### 4. Nuance & Policy
* **Affect vs. Effect:** In IIED, the severity of distress *affects* liability (it is a required element). [cite_start]In other torts (like Battery), the severity of distress only *affects* the amount of damages[cite: 953].

# Trespass to Land

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Definition:** An intentional act that causes a physical invasion of the plaintiff's real property[cite: 1167, 1224].
* **Intent Requirement:** The defendant must intend the **underlying act** (e.g., walking, throwing an object) that results in the entry. [cite_start]The defendant does *not* need to intend to trespass[cite: 1197, 1198].
* **Damages:** Actual damages are **not** a prima facie element. [cite_start]A plaintiff can recover nominal damages ($1)[cite: 1168, 1172, 1228].
* [cite_start]**Possession vs. Ownership:** The cause of action belongs to the **possessor** of the land (e.g., a tenant), not necessarily the owner[cite: 1185, 1189].
* [cite_start]**Scope:** Trespass can occur on the surface, below the surface, or above the surface (airspace)[cite: 1221].

### 2. Key Cases
* [cite_start]**Case Name:** *Dougherty v. Stepp* [cite: 1151]
    * [cite_start]**Facts:** Surveyor entered the plaintiff's unenclosed/unfenced land by mistake[cite: 1153, 1191].
    * **Holding:** Constitutes trespass. Land does not need to be fenced. Mistake is not a defense. [cite_start]No actual damage to the land is required[cite: 1157, 1162, 1202].
* [cite_start]**Case Name:** *Herrin v. Sutherland* [cite: 1219]
    * [cite_start]**Facts:** Defendant shot at ducks flying over the plaintiff's land[cite: 1220].
    * **Holding:** Trespass to land established. [cite_start]Physical invasion can occur in the airspace above the land[cite: 1227].

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples
* [cite_start]**Landlord Entry:** If a landlord enters a tenant's apartment without permission (and without lease authority), it is Trespass to Land because the tenant has exclusive possession[cite: 1183, 1184].
* **Accidental Fall:** If a person trips and falls onto another's land, it is **not** trespass. [cite_start]They did not have the intent to do the underlying volitional act of stepping onto the land[cite: 1205, 1212, 1213].
* [cite_start]**Transferred Intent:** If a hunter shoots over land (Trespass to Land) and accidentally hits a person, the intent transfers, and they are liable for Battery[cite: 1247, 1251].

# Procedural Notes

* [cite_start]**Demurrer:** A legal motion filed by a defendant arguing that, even if all facts in the complaint are true, they are insufficient to state a cause of action (e.g., failing to allege "severe" distress in an IIED claim)[cite: 1009, 1018, 1024].
* [cite_start]**Nominal Damages:** A token award (e.g., $1) used to vindicate a legal right (e.g., proving ownership/boundary in trespass) when no actual damage occurred[cite: 1228, 1235].
* [cite_start]**Terminology:** Do not use criminal law terms like "victim" in civil torts cases; use "plaintiff"[cite: 291, 294].
