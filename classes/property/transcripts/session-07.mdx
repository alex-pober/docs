# Property - Session 07

## Transcript

Fatemeh Razavi: I'm so proud of you.

Fatemeh Razavi: If you picked up, I knew that, my alert.

John Rogers: Alright, everyone.

John Rogers: So, I got through some essays, I'd still have some more to work on, so if you haven't gotten feedback yet, I'm on it. I just didn't expect so many people to email me. I had, like, 20 essays.

John Rogers: So I'm really happy about that.

John Rogers: Because… Usually, I don't get so many.

John Rogers: I think I had a class of… 80 students last…

John Rogers: year and last semester, and I think maybe 4 total, actually, 4 or 5 that actually submitted an essay to me.

John Rogers: Don't know why.

John Rogers: But a lot of you did, so I will get to it, okay? And I just realized that a lot of the people that sent them to me early, I didn't get to yet. So, I have to go back to the very beginning, other than the people I've gotten to.

John Rogers: So, I do apologize. But if you want to send me a text message, or send me an email and say, hey, what's the status? I'll get back to you, okay?

John Rogers: I don't know where we left off yesterday, so can someone tell me?

John Rogers: last week. It has been a very long… Weak for me.

John Rogers: And I'm very happy, because I don't have court tomorrow, so I'm in a good mood. So I'll be in a good mood.

John Rogers: No court tomorrow.

John Rogers: Does anyone know where we left off from last class?

Karen Hernandez: You spoke about restraints briefly, and then mentioned remainder.

Karen Hernandez: Those are my last notes.

John Rogers: I feel like we talked about that a while ago, but…

Yessenia Soria: No, I have the same thing as her.

John Rogers: Restraint? Really?

Yessenia Soria: Restraints and alien… on alienation.

John Rogers: That's what we left off on?

John Rogers: We weren't in the textbook, I think we were in the textbook, weren't we?

Tamara Baghdasaryan: Progress.

John Rogers: You were on page 274, question number one. You answered last… you answered the first question, and that's where you stopped.

John Rogers: That, I think I kind of remember.

Fatemeh Razavi: Yeah, it was the 1600 O conveys Black Acre to A for Life, and you answered question one, and you answered the second part of question 1 as well.

John Rogers: We didn't go over the gray case, or anything like that? No cases?

John Rogers: We didn't go over that?

Fatemeh Razavi: We did go over cases as well.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: There we go.

John Rogers: So did we go over… hold on.

Yessenia Soria: Yes, we went over the null versus gray.

John Rogers: Okay, and then what else did we do?

John Rogers: The Odd Fellows case? Moscano, is that what we're supposed to do now?

John Rogers: Sorry, I should know this.

John Rogers: But I don't.

Yessenia Soria: I only have that we did that one.

John Rogers: You… excuse me?

Fatemeh Razavi: No, there was two, there's two of them.

Yessenia Soria: Okay.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Armin did too, I remember that.

Leanna Badar: We did the.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: It depends on…

Leanna Badar: versus Whedon?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: First off, Do you guys have any questions from, what we've gone over.

John Rogers: Any questions at all?

John Rogers: You can always send me a private message with a question. I won't call you out.

John Rogers: You're good. You're good if you wrote me a private message, you're good.

John Rogers: No, no questions at all, there's zero, you don't have any questions at all.

John Rogers: Alright, you guys are… Very smart.

John Rogers: Oh, man.

John Rogers: I'm gonna email the whole faculty and say, hey, there's a lot of smart people in my… property class.

John Rogers: I did speak to a couple of my old students yesterday at the Valley. And…

John Rogers: They said that constitutional law was harder than evidence and real property.

John Rogers: It's very dry, but I still stand by this class is hard.

John Rogers: So… We did Baker vs. Wheaton, Mississippi, okay.

John Rogers: Enable.

John Rogers: This is some of the notes on 289.

John Rogers: Look at waste right in the middle. The life tenant may want to take minerals out of the land, or cut timber, or take down still-usable building.

John Rogers: The actions may constitute waste, entitling the remainderman, or remainder woman.

John Rogers: To an injunction or damages. Okay, so the remedy is injunction or damages.

John Rogers: Typically, when we talk about injunction, I usually defer to your remedies class, but I think remedies will probably start being discontinued, and it will merge in with contracts, I think.

John Rogers: 292 goes into the… 3 different types of waste.

John Rogers: We've covered them.

Amir Akbari: Yes, you did.

John Rogers: Thank you. Thank you.

doven: We covered some briefly, I think.

John Rogers: I mean, we lectured on it, I lectured on it, but just for reference, it's right there in your book.

John Rogers: Affirmative waste.

John Rogers: Liability results from injurious acts that have more than trivial effects. Generally, injurious has meant acts of substance to reduce the value of the property in question.

John Rogers: Permissive waste, essentially, negligence.

John Rogers: And narrative waste, Tenant increases rather than decreases the market value of the land.

John Rogers: 294 goes into leasehold estates and defusible estates. Defeasible estates.

John Rogers: The feasible estates.

John Rogers: We go kind of towards the bottom, the fee simple to terminal, the fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and fee simple subject to executory limitation.

doven: May I ask what page that is?

John Rogers: 295.

John Rogers: A fee simple determinable is a fee simple so limited that it will end automatically when a stated event happens.

John Rogers: For example.

John Rogers: Oak conveys Blackacre to Hartford School Board, its successors, and assigns, so long as the premises are used for school purposes.

John Rogers: So long as. Notice it's so long as.

John Rogers: The fee simple may constitute forever, but if the land ceases to be used for school purposes, the fee simple will come to an end, or, using the old word, determine.

John Rogers: that the fee simple will revert back to O, the grantor. The fee simple determinable is sometimes called fee simple on a special limitation. I didn't know that, indicating that the fee will expire.

John Rogers: by this limitation, if it occurs. I didn't know that.

John Rogers: Notice here, the fee simple determinant is created by language connoting that the transfer is conveying a fee simple only until an event happens. In that example above, the word, so long as the premises are used for school purposes, connotes a determinable fee.

John Rogers: Notice other language, while used for school purposes, during the continuance of said school until the board no longer uses the school, or words with durational aspect.

John Rogers: Notice here, words of motivation, or even desire, are insufficient.

John Rogers: The conveyance to the Hartford School Board for school purposes gives the board a fee-simple absolute, and not a fee-simple determinable. Interesting.

John Rogers: Every free simple determinable is accompanied by a possibility of reverter, which is a future interest held in the grantor.

John Rogers: Below that, fee simple, subject to a condition, subsequent to the Hartford School Board, its successors and assigns, but if the premises is not used for school purposes, the grantor has the right to re-enter and retake the premises.

John Rogers: The board's fee simple may be cut short if O elects to exercise the right of entry, but it is not automatically terminated.

John Rogers: I only read from the book because I think it's important, and I want to make sure that I say it, but I can always just default. Hey, it's in your book, read it! I just don't know if you will.

John Rogers: You're supposed to, though.

John Rogers: The right of entry on 297, which is second paragraph in, says, for example, depending upon the circumstance of the transaction, a conveyance to A and his heirs, provided, always.

John Rogers: kind of… Like a former bar exam.

John Rogers: And upon this condition that Affersaid premises shall

John Rogers: Not be used for a tavern might be construed by a court to create either a fee-simple subjection subsequent.

John Rogers: Hmm.

John Rogers: That kind of answers the question when the right of entry is not expressly reserved.

John Rogers: And subject to executory limitation, remember that is when there's a third party. There's seat, for example.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Paul Smith's College of Arts and Sciences.

John Rogers: Yahoo.

John Rogers: Can anyone do this one?

John Rogers: Volunteers for this case?

John Rogers: This is kind of a new addition.

John Rogers: Paul Smith's College of Arts and Sciences, 298.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Professor, this is John. I can do it. Sorry for the delay, I was trying to find it in my notes.

John Rogers: No problem, John, go ahead.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Okay, so this gave… this went up to the, Appellate Division of the Supreme Court. This is, Paul Smith's College of Art and Sciences.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Versus Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Augsenberg.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Paul Smith's College, they sought to,

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Quite titled to act attractive land in Franklin County, this is up in New York.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): This was against the Diocese of Augsburg. A trial court dismissed

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And, they upheld the diocese interest under the deed.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): College appealed, and I went up to the, Appellate Division of, the Supreme Court in New York.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Some of the facts. This was in 37. Smith conveyed land in Franklin County to the Roman Catholic Diocese.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): D contained the following condition. The land was conveyed for so long as the premises shall be used for church purposes, and if not so used, title shall revert to Paul Smith's college.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Diocese built and maintained St. Gabriel's Church on the property, and used it actively for decades, but in the 1970s, the diocese ceased using the land.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): As a parish church, close the building, and they stopped conducting services.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Paul Smith's College then sued, arguing the Diocese estate terminated, and the land reverted back to fee, simple, determinable language of the deed.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Only a fee simple, subject to condition subsequent, meaning the title did not automatically revert, but required affirmative re-entry by the college.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): One of the… one of the quotes in there, the intent was not to divest the title automatically, but merely to provide the grantor with an option to re-enter if religious use ceased.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And the college countered.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): In plain words, so long… in plain words, they said, so long as and shall revert unmistakably establish an estate in fee simple determinable.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Under the rule of law, words of temporal duration, so long as, until, during.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Summarize fee simple determinables. Now, such conveyances would automatically divest upon breach.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And the grantor retains the possibility of reverter. But by contrast, conditional words, like, upon condition, provided that, and but if.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): conditions subsequent.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And those would require reaffirmative re-entry by the grantor.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): At issuance, did 37D create a fee simple determinable?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Or a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): In the court's analysis, the court… some of my notes in here say they examined the language's deed, or the language within the deed, and they look back at those words you talked about earlier, the terminables and the

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): So I have, like, for so long as the premise of shall, church purpose, not used, and, title shall revert. And these words were not mere conditionally language, but durational with an explicit reverter. Diocese urged the court to constitute ambiguous against forfeiture, but the court emphasized that here, the language was not ambiguous.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): On the judge's reasonings, where the grantor used clear words of duration, followed by an expressive…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Not at liberty to transform the grant into one subject merely to a condition subsequent.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): So, the court held the diocese estate was a fee simple determinable.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And, the ruling, the appell division reverted… reversed the lower court's holding.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And they say that, Paul Smith's College was owned… Paul Smith's College owned the property in fee simple absolute by virtue of Roberter.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Judgment for Paul Smith's College.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And that's as far as I got. And then I have a bunch of diagrams I wrote out, trying to…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): decipher the fee simple determinable over fee conditions subsequent. So…

John Rogers: I put a lot of notes on this. You said so long as… is that written anywhere? I don't see that anywhere.

John Rogers: You said so long, did I miss it?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): No, these were… yeah, I had written down words you had used earlier in my notes, where you talked about, determining… determinable conditions, so long as… yada yada yada.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Was it not a determinatable?

John Rogers: I mean, I could see that's what it says, but I'm wanting to double-check something real quick. Maybe because it's just… I kind of disagree, but not with you, but with the case, in my own opinion.

John Rogers: It says, the deed stated, property, and this is the few sentences from the very beginning.

John Rogers: used as for church purposes only, and in case the said premises shall be devoted to any other use than church purposes, this conveyance shall be void, and the parties of the

John Rogers: First part shall have the right to re-enter and retake possession of the premises and every part thereof.

John Rogers: Did I get that right?

John Rogers: I think so, right?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, yeah, you did. You did good.

John Rogers: So, the problem with this… is… With that is… Personally.

John Rogers: It says, right to re-enter and take possession.

John Rogers: So anytime I see that, I think that that is far more controlling, because that shows what the grantor's intent is.

John Rogers: Okay, that's my opinion.

John Rogers: I think that is more controlling, I think it trumps. So if I were to see something like this, and I were to be…

John Rogers: Huh.

John Rogers: analyzing this, even for an exam, I would call this a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: Let me see something, though. I want to make sure I didn't miss something here.

John Rogers: Does anybody, first off, does anyone disagree with that?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: This is a bit strange, though, because we have a situation where it says…

John Rogers: So, think of it as O2A

John Rogers: For residential purposes only, and if it's not, It shall… shall be void.

John Rogers: And the party… first party, O, will have the right to re-enter and retake.

John Rogers: So I can kind of see that. So, there's two parts.

John Rogers: So, the right to re-enter and retake is…

John Rogers: Evidence of a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: That right of re-entry is a discretionary right on part of O, to be able to re-enter at their discretion, at their power, whenever, to terminate.

John Rogers: But what appears to be very controlling to the New York court here are two things.

John Rogers: One, church purposes only.

John Rogers: The word only.

John Rogers: coupled with… Premises shall be… sorry.

John Rogers: this conveyance shall be void.

John Rogers: So, you have to look at those two words, and this court was grappling with that.

John Rogers: And this court found that the word only and shall be void are more indications of a fee-simple determinable which carries an automatic forfeiture.

John Rogers: shall be void.

John Rogers: means it's gone.

John Rogers: Terminated.

John Rogers: Doesn't exist anymore.

John Rogers: But when it's void, and automatically void, That doesn't make…

John Rogers: Sense with the right to re-enter.

John Rogers: The word should have been, then, void a bull.

John Rogers: But it says void.

John Rogers: It says, shall be void.

John Rogers: The term only Is partly consistent with,

John Rogers: The term only is consistent with the determinable.

John Rogers: It's strict limitations, and shows that the grantor intended for the recipient the diocese to… To have this property.

John Rogers: But… Not beyond, at any time, a breach.

John Rogers: Which is consistent with the determinable estate.

John Rogers: So, what we're extracting from this case, for important test-taking purposes, is that purposes only and shall be void when there's a breach.

John Rogers: Are more controlling and evidence the determinable estate.

John Rogers: Versus the latter part, right to re-enter, which is inconsistent with the determinable.

John Rogers: So, the intentions of the grantor were to convey

John Rogers: a fee-simple determiner. Does that make sense? I butcher that up for you.

doven: You said it… This case has a mixture with the language of fee, simple, determinable, and fee.

doven: A simple subject to… This is subsequent, but it really is feasible, determinable.

John Rogers: This court is saying this is a fee-simple determinable, so if we go on 299, what I said before.

John Rogers: The second-to-last paragraph, kind of 5 lines down, it says here the term void

John Rogers: Which precedes the right to re-enter language is distinguishable from Boyd a bull.

John Rogers: When something is voidable, it doesn't mean it's automatically void, it just means at some point, whoever holds that power can void it at any time.

John Rogers: void a bull.

John Rogers: But when it has words like void shall be void.

John Rogers: That saying that upon breach, or when it ceases to be used for church purposes, it's gone.

John Rogers: It's void.

John Rogers: Immediately.

John Rogers: And when something's immediate, immediately forfeited, that's consistent with the fee simple determinable.

John Rogers: That makes sense.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: I hate these things, because what is church purposes?

John Rogers: What is church purposes? Oh, we use this as a dumpster… we use this property as a…

John Rogers: as a dumpster.

John Rogers: Where we throw all our trash.

John Rogers: Garbage.

John Rogers: The garbage people collect it.

John Rogers: Is that church purposes?

Yessenia Soria: No.

John Rogers: Why?

Yessenia Soria: Because the church used to go pray.

Yessenia Soria: for Masses, for people to go and…

John Rogers: Find spiritual healing. Church purpose.

John Rogers: purposes. What was that? So, I mean, you're saying a church can't throw away trash?

Yessenia Soria: Oh, I thought you meant it was for people to throw trash at the church.

John Rogers: Well, no, it's the church's property, and the church is obligated to use this land for church purposes. So what is church purposes? So is using this land for garbage of the church, for example, a church purpose?

John Rogers: you would typically think it's a place of worship, and we go have fun, or whatever it is we talk about in those things.

John Rogers: But that's not what is said. It's just church purposes.

John Rogers: So, I don't know.

John Rogers: I would think so.

John Rogers: I would think that it's church purposes.

John Rogers: Questions

John Rogers: Haha, alright.

Yessenia Soria: Can you, can you, can you, explain the void and voidable again? Because I'm a little confused with that.

John Rogers: Well, what does void and voidable mean, you know?

Yessenia Soria: I know what they mean, but when… in that sentence on page 299 that you read.

Yessenia Soria: It just confuses me, like, void means terminated right there. Voidable is it…

Yessenia Soria: For future, or what is it?

John Rogers: Well… Let's suppose I give you my car, and I say, if you go above 65 miles an hour.

John Rogers: It's void. This transfer is void.

John Rogers: That means it's gone. You don't have the car anymore, right?

John Rogers: But if I say I give you my car, and I say, if you go above 65,

John Rogers: This transfer is void of bull.

John Rogers: So does that mean you don't have the car anymore, or does that mean that I can take it whenever I feel like it now?

Yessenia Soria: Makes sense now. Thank you.

John Rogers: Yeah, so if it says void, this shall be void, it means this shall end.

John Rogers: And if it ends, That's automatic forfeiture.

John Rogers: Which is consistent with the fee simple determinable.

John Rogers: Where if it said void a bowl.

John Rogers: That would be consistent with a V simple subject to a condition subsequent.

Yessenia Soria: Thank you.

Amir Akbari: Can we say the… Void is like a reversion, and voidable is like a possibility of reversion.

John Rogers: No.

Amir Akbari: About possibility of Roberto?

John Rogers: You got that mixed up. Void is, like, a possibility of reverter.

John Rogers: Void of bull is, like, a right of entry.

Amir Akbari: So, the first one, really, void, is an automatic forfeiture forfeiture, right?

John Rogers: Yeah?

Amir Akbari: And it's, like, a reversion.

Amir Akbari: It's funny.

John Rogers: There's no… don't talk about reversion. Okay. It's possibility of reverse.

Amir Akbari: fruit.

John Rogers: E, simple, determinable.

Amir Akbari: Determinable.

John Rogers: And then if it's buoyed a bowl… It means it could terminate

John Rogers: Whoever has the power to terminate at any time.

John Rogers: Which is consistent with a right of entry.

Amir Akbari: entry.

Amir Akbari: Got it, thanks.

John Rogers: So remember, like, O to A…

John Rogers: On condition that Blackacre is used for residential purposes.

John Rogers: And if not, O reserves the right to re-enter and take back.

John Rogers: You guys seen that before?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yep.

John Rogers: Yes, you have. You have… So if I use it as a karate studio, What can you do?

John Rogers: You're out.

Sennett Devermont: Re-enter and reclaim?

John Rogers: But do I… do you have to do it right away?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: No.

John Rogers: Do it anytime you want, right?

John Rogers: But nonetheless, it's voidable. The transfer to me is voidable, and you can exercise that whenever you want, right?

John Rogers: Whereas, if it's void, it's automatic. You don't have to do anything.

John Rogers: it automatically forfeits back to you. So, the word void here was very controlling.

John Rogers: coupled with… purposes only.

John Rogers: So even though you don't necessarily see so long as, while, until, you don't see those types of words, you see only and void.

John Rogers: Which was construed to mean,

John Rogers: To show the intentions of the grantor to create a determinable estate.

doven: Can I ask a question? So, Vloyd is…

doven: Right divert, or reverse? Reversion?

John Rogers: There's no… it's… here's the thing, I'm just going what this case is saying, and it's here, it's on 299, you guys can all read it if you want. I'm assuming you guys all did. But,

John Rogers: Void.

John Rogers: Void means it's obliterated, it's done, no one has to do anything. If I give you my car, and you go above 65, and I told you, if you ever go above 65,

John Rogers: This transaction is void.

John Rogers: It's gone. You don't have the car anymore. So if you go 66,

John Rogers: You give me back the car, it's my car, automatic, it's void.

John Rogers: If I said, if I give you my car, and I say, if you go above 65,

John Rogers: Me giving you this car is void a bull.

John Rogers: That doesn't mean if you go 66, you lose it. It just means I have the power.

John Rogers: To take it from you at any time.

John Rogers: So it's for your bulk.

doven: A void would be, feasible determinable, so that would be, like, reversion.

John Rogers: there's no reversion. If it's a fee-simple determinable, it'd be a possibility of reverter.

doven: Oh, okay.

John Rogers: You guys, just, just because you guys, many of you guys have said this tonight, a reversion is when a life estate is conveyed, okay?

John Rogers: Don't get that mixed up on a final exam, okay? Don't get that mixed up.

John Rogers: Don't get it mixed up.

John Rogers: But I understand you guys are just learning, it's okay.

John Rogers: Any questions?

John Rogers: So, if we go on 301,

John Rogers: Right in the middle, it says, today in most American states.

John Rogers: The possibility of reverter and the right of entry, like other property interests, are transferable intervivos and divisible.

John Rogers: But a few states, so this is the minority view, continue to follow the common law rule. The interests are not transferable interview votes or divisible except to the owner of the possessory fee.

John Rogers: So basically saying this, if I convey you Blackacre, So long as you use Blackacre for residential purposes.

John Rogers: The common law rules, I can't transfer my possibility of reverter to someone else.

John Rogers: Modernly, iPhone law.

John Rogers: says you can't.

John Rogers: iPhone.

doven: Can I ask what page that is.

John Rogers: 301.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: jeez, I was chit-chatting with some former students yesterday before my class, and I was like, yeah, I teach iPhone law, and they were like, oh my god, that's… sounds so old. I'm like, oh my god, I'm never saying that again, man. I'm never saying that again. Here I am, saying it.

John Rogers: Here's, note number 2 on page 302.

John Rogers: the presumption in favor of a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. This happens.

John Rogers: In cases of ambiguity.

John Rogers: The usual presumption is that because the more drastic consequences of automatic forfeiture, with limitation of a fee-simple determinable is breach, the language will be construed as creating a fee-simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: That is telling you this. If there's hopeless ambiguity, and you can't measure the grantor's intent, you don't know, it's not gonna hold it against the grantee.

John Rogers: If the grantee, breaches.

John Rogers: Because maybe the grantee was not aware of the repercussions, because it's ambiguous.

John Rogers: So, it's gonna lean in favor

John Rogers: Of not automatically terminating the estate.

John Rogers: So, if there's hopeless ambiguity, Then it defaults to a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: Here's something interesting.

John Rogers: I think this was tested on a final exam. I used to teach this class years ago with a woman named Michelle Tabanka.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: you could probably find her on, like, Instagram or wherever, and if you follow her and shoot her a message and say, hey, I still see your exam, she'd love you. She'd love you. She is a woman that retired, and she's so lovely and sweet, so if you see any exam questions that deal with

John Rogers: Gardens or flowers, she wrote it.

John Rogers: She's probably one of the smartest people I've ever met that knows the rule against perpetuities super well. Better than anyone I've ever met.

John Rogers: So… That's a… that's a rule we're gonna probably learn maybe next week.

John Rogers: So, number 3, Oak conveys Blackacre. Let's look at this, okay? O2A, I assume this is iPhone law. O2A, oh yeah, it is. Oh, well, airs. So long as the premises are not used for the sale of beer, wine, or liquor.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So you can't use this premises for the sale of beer, wine, or liquor

John Rogers: And IF beer, wine, or liquor is sold on the premises, O retains the right to re-enter and retake the premises.

John Rogers: So… Do you see a problem there?

John Rogers: Looks like there could be a problem there, right?

John Rogers: What's the problem? Does anybody know?

Fatemeh Razavi: It could be a fee simple determinable because of the first part, but the second part is a feasible subject to condition subsequent.

John Rogers: Yeah, so you kind of have to grapple with this and figure out, well, that's the problem, so you've identified the situation. So we got a situation going on here, okay? So it's our job to figure out what that is, because it's either going to be a determinable or condition subsequent.

John Rogers: So notice, the problem is, it says, so long as.

John Rogers: So long as it's consistent with the determinant. Automatic forfeiture.

John Rogers: But the latter part says, Right to re-enter.

John Rogers: Upon breach, which is consistent with the right of entry, That only exists.

John Rogers: when a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent is conveyed. So, we have to figure out what this is. This is one of those situations where the authors in the book would conclude that this is actually a fee simple determinable. I, in my personal opinion, and the way I analyze this, I would think that this is a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: Because the authors say that the so long has is controlling. I don't think so.

John Rogers: I think the latter part is more controlling, because that…

John Rogers: evidences what O intended to happen if there was a breach.

John Rogers: Subsequently, A opens a restaurant on Black Acre.

John Rogers: Be careful doing that, because, what, 90% of the time, restaurants fail?

John Rogers: that serves… Several dishes cooked with wine or flamed with brandy.

John Rogers: That breach, just right then and there?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Technically?

John Rogers: Is it?

Karen Hernandez: No, it's not being sold.

John Rogers: And, at Sunday brunch, Yahoo, Offers complimentary… a complimentary glass of champagne.

John Rogers: A's restaurant is successful. Wow. Hmm, interesting. And 11 years after its opening, B wants to buy it.

John Rogers: And at a bar.

John Rogers: So… Is A in breach?

Mireya Gonzalez: Now they are that they're offering the champagne.

Yessenia Soria: No, because they're cooking, they're not selling the liquor, and the champagne's free.

Mireya Gonzalez: Complimentary.

Sennett Devermont: But I do think they have a benefit and a cost to get free champagne as well.

John Rogers: It's free.

John Rogers: It says, complimentary glass of champagne.

John Rogers: with the purchase of the brunch food, I would assume.

John Rogers: So the predominant… Brunch. What?

gevorg kulikyan: The champagne's priced in.

John Rogers: Yeah, maybe, I guess, I don't know. Text, text, text A, let me know.

gevorg kulikyan: Well, they can't get the champagne if they don't buy anything.

John Rogers: Sure.

gevorg kulikyan: So they're still paying something.

John Rogers: Yeah, they're buying food. Yeah, I don't know.

John Rogers: Somebody text A and let me know what A says.

John Rogers: Covenants on note number 4?

John Rogers: Covenants, we will learn about next semester, week, 10.

John Rogers: If you make the mistake of taking me next semester.

John Rogers: Or.

John Rogers: I might not be teaching next week, so who knows? Maybe I get fired, maybe I'll be replaced?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Hope not.

Yessenia Soria: Yep.

Yessenia Soria: I hope not, because I'll be taking…

John Rogers: Oh, man.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Stick around, we need consistency.

John Rogers: I have been trying to get out of property for a long time.

John Rogers: Bye!

Yessenia Soria: There'll be evidence.

John Rogers: Excuse me?

Yessenia Soria: Isn't the second part evidence?

John Rogers: Well, I'm saying…

Yessenia Soria: 40?

John Rogers: What?

Yessenia Soria: Nevermind.

John Rogers: Evidence is a totally different class.

Yessenia Soria: Oh.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): He definitely will not…

John Rogers: There's only 2 people in this…

John Rogers: class that are in my evidence class, I think.

John Rogers: I don't… I'm not that bad. I'm very…

John Rogers: I think I'm nice in that class. I don't think I'm as mean as I used to be.

Avi Omrany: Projection hearsay.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Tough crowd!

John Rogers: Yeah, but melting my heart with those objections.

John Rogers: Here's an interesting one.

John Rogers: Mountain Brow Lodge.

John Rogers: Odd Fellows. Interesting! I'm gonna join a men's club that says Odd Fellows.

John Rogers: versus Toscano. So that's the 5th District, California Court of Appeal.

John Rogers: So, when you reference in state California, the appellate court, it's court of appeal, not plural.

John Rogers: Court of Appeal.

John Rogers: Now… You will learn more about the Court of Appeal.

John Rogers: maybe in the summertime, or maybe the following summer, when you take one of my favorite, favorite individuals in the faculty, and that is with David Glassman.

John Rogers: And I will get text messages and phone calls saying, my summer's over! This is so hard! Oh, I'm gonna die!

John Rogers: I love that, man.

John Rogers: Absolutely love that, man.

John Rogers: Are there any volunteers?

John Rogers: for Toscopic.

John Rogers: didn't I say that I was going to do all the cases? I did say that, I think, at the very beginning, that I was going to brief the cases, because I heard that one of my colleagues, Steve Zand, or Professor Zand, briefs his

John Rogers: cases in his class, is that correct, or am I mistaken?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: That's correct.

John Rogers: Yeah, so he said he does, and I'm like, oh, I'll do that too.

John Rogers: So, but I'd like to at least…

John Rogers: get a little bit of help. So I like to invoke the help of A student, to help me.

John Rogers: So, just get started. Tell me what it's about, what's going on.

Avi Omrany: I could do it, Professor.

John Rogers: No objection.

Avi Omrany: So, the Toscanos gave a piece of property to the Mountain Lodge

Avi Omrany: the Mountain Bro Lodge as a gift, this is foreshadowing. The gift said that the property was only for the lodge's use, and if the lodge didn't use it or sell it, then it would go back to the Toscanos.

Avi Omrany: After the Toscanos died, the lodge wanted to make sure that they still owned it without any conditions, and then the court said that since the lodge was still using the property, that the original gift was still in action, and the lodge didn't agree, so they appealed in court.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: This is interesting.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: Want to… bring everyone's attention to 305,

John Rogers: The paragraph, small little paragraph, with the small squiggly lines, which we put together as letters.

John Rogers: And those put together are words.

John Rogers: Let's look at this. I got my highlighter out.

John Rogers: Said property. So this property. Said property.

John Rogers: this property… is restricted.

John Rogers: And I don't know if you guys ever noticed, I'm a slow reader. I read slow, because I think about it a lot, and I overthink. I think it's my OCD.

John Rogers: Said property is restricted for the use and benefit of the second party.

John Rogers: Interesting.

John Rogers: Okay? Only. Here's that word, only.

John Rogers: And… And… And… In the event the same fails to be used by the second party.

John Rogers: Or, in the event of sale or transfer by the second party of all or part of said lot.

John Rogers: The same is to revert to the first parties herein, their successors, heirs, or assigns. Does anybody have any idea?

John Rogers: What is going on here?

John Rogers: Let me see…

John Rogers: Alright, so I'm gonna share my screen.

John Rogers: And I won't be able to see… All your lovely faces.

John Rogers: Oh, wait, I'm not the host!

John Rogers: I'm not the host! I can't share my screen!

John Rogers: I'm not the host.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Well, how'd that happen?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Who's hosting?

Avi Omrany: LAX room is the host.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: somebody called the LAX room, and…

John Rogers: Well, I guess we're gonna have to do this old-fashioned way.

John Rogers: That means you're gonna have to see…

Armen Sarbashyan: Oh, I'm actually at the campus, I could go and, like, tell.

Armen Sarbashyan: Chris or someone.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Armin, get out of there, go tell Chris to turn that damn thing off!

Armen Sarbashyan: Yeah.

John Rogers: You want me to share the screen, so you want to see me type things on a Word document? Is that what you guys want me to do?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Put the squiggly letters into those things called words, we'd love to see it.

John Rogers: Someone is paying attention to what I say. It just melts my heart when I hear that.

John Rogers: squiggly lines.

John Rogers: All right.

John Rogers: If someone could notify the people In the physical world.

John Rogers: to make me the host, I'd appreciate it. But from now, from right on, from now.

John Rogers: I want to talk about the second part.

John Rogers: It says, and in the event the same fails.

John Rogers: Or, in the event…

John Rogers: What is that?

John Rogers: It looks like a restraint, right?

John Rogers: So if you're a recipient, And you get a conveyance that says…

John Rogers: In the event sale or transfer.

John Rogers: You'll lose it. Isn't that a restraint?

John Rogers: this court… quickly shot down the second part and crossed it out. Said that's clearly a restraint.

John Rogers: The second part, the first part, And knowing the second part, was important.

John Rogers: Because it helps carve the analysis For the first part.

John Rogers: So the second part's crossed out. It's a restraint. Done. Sorry.

John Rogers: Now let's look at the first part.

John Rogers: First sentence.

John Rogers: Said property is restricted for the use and benefit of second party.

John Rogers: What is that? Is that a theme? What is that?

John Rogers: Anybody know?

John Rogers: Well… The question I have is this. If I convey property to you, And it's restricted to you…

John Rogers: For your use and your benefit.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: You with me so far? It's to YOU!

John Rogers: for your use, And your benefit.

John Rogers: Does that imply… You can't sell it?

John Rogers: Maybe, right?

John Rogers: Because it's to your use and your benefit. If you transfer it to someone else, it would be for their use and their benefit, right?

John Rogers: So that's the issue.

John Rogers: So, did… The grantor can they a fee?

John Rogers: Like, a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, for example?

John Rogers: or… the… the recipients…

John Rogers: the… Oddfellows.

John Rogers: Do they have it in fee simple absolute?

John Rogers: Because if they're withheld from the power of sale.

John Rogers: Then that part is crossed out, which means that they walk away with a fee simple absolute.

John Rogers: So, this is what was interesting from this court.

John Rogers: Is that they looked at the second part that was crossed out and compared it with the first part.

John Rogers: It was clearly a restraint, the second part.

John Rogers: So they said, what was the intentions of the grantor?

John Rogers: The second part, the grantor had the intentions of penalizing them for selling.

John Rogers: Or transferring it.

John Rogers: So the grantor is not going to be repetitive twice.

John Rogers: And that's certainly not what the grantor was intending on the first part.

John Rogers: Does that make sense?

John Rogers: So it was construed then.

John Rogers: to be a… feed.

John Rogers: fee simple subject to a condition. Subsequent. Does that make sense? Am I making sense to you guys?

doven: The fee simple, subject, or subsequent.

John Rogers: Yes.

doven: Okay, it's restricted to just a second party.

doven: They cross out the second part, and then they said it's.

John Rogers: Yes.

doven: Claim is to revert to the first party's heroine.

John Rogers: Sure.

doven: Do they keep if the same fails to be used by the second party?

John Rogers: It… it… it's explicit.

John Rogers: The second part that… It's a restraint.

doven: So they cross out the transfer, or they cross out both the transfer and the failed to be used?

John Rogers: I'll… I'm the host now.

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: So, let me think. It's… it would be…

John Rogers: O conveys Black Acre on condition that Blackacre is used for

John Rogers: the benefit of A only, and that if A ever sells or transfers Blackacre, That's what it would…

doven: Oh.

John Rogers: So kind of look at it like this.

John Rogers: So it's like, oh… conveys… ugh.

John Rogers: Black Acre… 2A on condition mat. Can you guys see my screen okay?

Karen Hernandez: Yes.

Yessenia Soria: Yep.

John Rogers: Where I say, was used for…

John Rogers: the benefit of A is used for the… Benefit of A.

John Rogers: And if A or anyone else sells or transfers.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, they're kind of saying this, if it's used for the benefit of A,

John Rogers: A, it implies… one of the arguments was very creative. It implies that A can't sell it, because then it wouldn't benefit A, it would benefit someone else.

John Rogers: But they said that wasn't the intentions of O.

John Rogers: Because here, it was very explicit that, oh.

John Rogers: Wanted to penalize the sale or transfer on the second part.

John Rogers: So, since it was very explicit here, it's crossed out.

John Rogers: And so the grantor is not going to be repetitive for the first part and second part. The intentions were to create a fee.

John Rogers: A fee simple, subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: So it's very important to determine the second part, because that shapes the analysis for the first part.

John Rogers: Make sense?

doven: You're saying both of them are the same?

John Rogers: Not the same, but, it's… you want to examine the second part.

John Rogers: Because if you determine, then that's a restraint on alienation.

John Rogers: Then, you'd know that the grantor was not intending to create a restraint on the first part, because why would the grantor be repetitive?

John Rogers: Do it twice.

John Rogers: The intentions of the first part were to create a defeasible feat.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: Now…

John Rogers: Now, the descent… kind of agree with. The Senate said, The dissent on this…

John Rogers: said that this constitutes a restraint, and I agree, because it's restricting the use of a lodge only.

John Rogers: Incidentally infringing upon the ability to sell it to someone else. I agree! I think so too! But that's not what the majority felt.

John Rogers: So, what you could say for the first part, was…

John Rogers: There was no intentions of creating a restraint.

John Rogers: But merely a condition on the land.

John Rogers: Of the use and control of it.

John Rogers: Does that make sense, everyone?

Fatemeh Razavi: Professor, where does this say… On condition in the…

John Rogers: It doesn't.

Fatemeh Razavi: Where would you have then assumed it? Because…

Fatemeh Razavi: I… I didn't… I saw it as a determinable.

John Rogers: Why?

Fatemeh Razavi: Because I didn't see on condition, so I just assumed…

Fatemeh Razavi: So it'd be as long as, it could be something like that.

John Rogers: Would be, but that's not what it says.

Fatemeh Razavi: That's why I'm asking, where did you see that?

John Rogers: I just… it says property is restricted for the use and benefit of the second party.

John Rogers: I just said on condition that, because the analysis was that it was a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent. Am I wrong?

Fatemeh Razavi: No, no, you're right, but I mean…

Fatemeh Razavi: like, let's say this is an exam, how would I be able to decipher that?

Fatemeh Razavi: Not even there's no analysis.

John Rogers: Well, here's the thing, though, too. If you can't figure it out, if it's ambiguous in a way, you default to the condition subsequent.

Fatemeh Razavi: I remember, thank you.

John Rogers: Questions?

doven: So, at the end, it said right to revert, that's, like, right of entry.

John Rogers: See you.

John Rogers: The same is to revert to the first parties here and their successors.

John Rogers: Yeah, you're right, the same is to revert. I don't know, what did they say about revert? My apologies.

John Rogers: Okay, I'm looking at, on page 306, this is what I said, or I'm reading from.

John Rogers: kind of in the middle on 306, a few lines, like, 6, 7 lines down. Under these circumstances, it's reasonably clear that when the grantors stated that the land was conveyed in consideration of love and affection, and added that it's restricted

John Rogers: For the use and benefit of the second party, they simply meant to say that the land was conveyed upon condition that it would be used for lodge.

John Rogers: That makes sense.

John Rogers: But I don't know if they discussed revert, that's interesting.

John Rogers: I don't think they discussed it, to be honest.

John Rogers: Yeah, I don't know. It didn't… I don't think they discussed revert. That's interesting, though.

John Rogers: I don't know, it didn't say.

John Rogers: Interesting point, though.

John Rogers: Questions?

Amir Akbari: Excuse me, and here, the type of the restraint is the disabling.

Amir Akbari: I am struggling with the types.

John Rogers: Well, what is a disabling restraint?

Amir Akbari: It's, withhold, from the grantee the power of transferring their interest.

John Rogers: You know, this is interesting.

John Rogers: Because it looks like disabling.

John Rogers: But it also looks forfeiture, because.

Amir Akbari: Yes, yeah.

John Rogers: But it's just not going to a third party.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, the same profile.

John Rogers: I would have to agree that it would constitute a disabling restraint.

John Rogers: Because a forfeiture restraint, which it really looks like, it's just not going to a third person.

John Rogers: Hold on.

John Rogers: -Oh, I didn't see… I don't know where restraints are. Okay, hold on.

John Rogers: I don't know what page we just… where restraints are, I thought.

John Rogers: Sorry.

John Rogers: It's note number 3, 284, but…

John Rogers: I'm checking the rule really quick.

John Rogers: useful.

John Rogers: I don't see it.

John Rogers: it looks…

John Rogers: it looks like a forfeiture restraint, but there's no third party, so I guess I would say it is a disabling restraint. So, I mean, I agree with you, but I want to double-check the rule.

John Rogers: So does anyone know what page… Restraints were on.

doven: May I ask a question? What's disabling and forfeiture of restraint? Is that in the notes, or…

John Rogers: It's definitely in my notes. It's gotta be. It's not something that I would not put in there. There's 3 types. The forfeiture restraint is when someone transfers land or conveys it.

John Rogers: But if there's ever some type of breach, then it goes to a third party. That would be forfeiture. A disabling restraint?

John Rogers: Means that,

John Rogers: that the transfer To any third party or sale is void.

John Rogers: Or nullified, null, or void.

John Rogers: The problem, though, is that… This says revert.

John Rogers: To go back to the grantor, not a third party.

John Rogers: So it's interesting.

John Rogers: Hold on.

John Rogers: Hold on, hold on.

John Rogers: Okay. Now, I wouldn't say that that's a promissory restraint, because no one's promising. I mean, you can kind of say maybe it is a promissory restraint, because by… no, it's not promised, because no one's promising to do anything. There's no promise.

John Rogers: So, sorry guys, I don't know what page restraints are on.

John Rogers: But I know it's somewhere.

Sennett Devermont: Is it the top of 307? Possibly not, but it did mention restraints for the alienation.

John Rogers: I'm looking for the notes on restraints, though. The notes section, so let me see…

John Rogers: I just want to make sure that I am giving you correct rules.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: That's okay.

Leanna Badar: I think there's one note section on 284 at the bottom.

John Rogers: Yeah, that's what I saw too, but I thought that there was a discussion of all three types.

John Rogers: So, hold on.

John Rogers: Might take me a few minutes.

John Rogers: 2.32?

John Rogers: Hold on.

John Rogers: Transfer restraint on combination…

John Rogers: I can't find it, I don't know. So, you guys might have to look for it.

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: But I do know we will go into restraint on marriage.

John Rogers: But, I don't know. Can't find it. In the interest of time, I'd… Not like to.

John Rogers: just looking for any section where it defines what the restraints are. I can't find it. Sorry, guys.

John Rogers: I've let you down.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Professor, I found one note on indirect restraints on page 909. I don't know if that's effective or not. It talks about indirect restraints.

John Rogers: Way down there, that's next semester.

John Rogers: 909… I'm just…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Digging through the book.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: What is that? I don't know?

John Rogers: It's first semester, because it's when you're learning.

John Rogers: I think this is dealing with covenants.

John Rogers: That's the number of covenants. I'm gonna move on to 311 now.

John Rogers: Condemnation of defeasible fees. This is very interesting. So what happens…

John Rogers: What happens if the government takes land? Can the government take someone's land?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): minute domain?

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Yes, so anyways, yes, you're right, so we'll learn this. If you make the mistake, if I'm still teaching and haven't been fired, and they haven't replaced me, then…

John Rogers: If you take… if you make the mistake of taking me next semester.

John Rogers: Then we will learn about eminent domain towards the end.

John Rogers: But the government can take your land. They can just say, get out.

John Rogers: Taken.

John Rogers: It's mine.

John Rogers: So long as it's used for public use, and you're justly compensated.

John Rogers: And that's the fair market value. But what happens if someone has it in, let's say, fee-simple determinable?

John Rogers: And the government takes it.

John Rogers: Does the person who has it in fee-simple, determinable just get all the money, or do they have to split it?

John Rogers: Between them and potential future interest holders.

John Rogers: And that's Ink vs. Canon, which is, I think, the last case in this chapter before we move on to future interest.

John Rogers: So, is there anyone that can…

John Rogers: Tell me about Ink vs. Canon.

Sennett Devermont: I'll do this one, Professor. Or I'll share just some info, I guess. Inc. City of Canton. The Inc. family deeded land to the City of Canton for use as a public park, subject to reverter if the land stopped being used as a park.

Sennett Devermont: When part of the land was taken by the state to build a highway, compensation was due. The city argued it should receive all of it since it held present possession.

Sennett Devermont: The Inc. family argued they retained a reversionary interest. The court held that because the city had received the land as a gift and paid nothing, it would be unjust to allow it

Sennett Devermont: to allow the entire award. So the city kept compensation for improvements it had made, like the buildings, but the underlying land value had to be apportioned, with a lower court determining the split between the city and the Inc. family heirs.

John Rogers: So, basically, I'll… go fairly quickly with this. This is Ohio, I believe.

John Rogers: And the Ohio Supreme Court didn't like the majority rule, where the,

John Rogers: the grantee themselves of the fee simple determinable, or defeasible fee holder, gets this windfall, just gets it all. They think it's not fair, because in some instances, a defeasible fee holder

John Rogers: didn't pay anything, they were just gifted it. So it doesn't really make it fair for them to reap all the benefits of it.

John Rogers: So the whole rationale was.

John Rogers: they don't think that's fair, but that's the majority rule. So, the Ohio Supreme Court

John Rogers: Which appears to be the minority view.

John Rogers: carved out a new rule that said, well…

John Rogers: In the interest of fairness and equity, we don't think that the defeasible fee holder should reap all the benefits, and it should be divided among them and the future interest holders.

John Rogers: So, in the event that someone has a defeasible fee, and the government just takes the land.

John Rogers: The majority of you is the holder of the defusible fee gets 100% of the market value.

John Rogers: The rationale for that is, is that a defusible fee could potentially last forever.

John Rogers: So, why would I have to… why would I have to share it with a future interest holder when they may never get something?

doven: You said that the gov… the fee-simple fee, the one who holds it, they get everything, or they have to buy it?

John Rogers: Yeah, the majority view, but this court thought that that was inequitable, unfair.

John Rogers: Silly.

John Rogers: Created their own rule.

doven: Oh, so they divided between, the current one.

doven: In the future.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: In the interest of fairness.

John Rogers: My colleague, former counterpart, years ago, she stopped teaching in 2000… 16.

John Rogers: Those were the days where I had to teach all sections of property. It was bad.

John Rogers: That's mean.

John Rogers: Very mean.

John Rogers: There was a concept of restraint on the Marriage.

John Rogers: So, it's like restraint on alienation.

John Rogers: Except… It's…

John Rogers: You get my property so long as you use it for residential purposes, and you never get married.

doven: Can you repeat that?

John Rogers: Right in the book. I think it's in my notes, too.

doven: Okay. But, it's…

John Rogers: Oak conveys Black Acre, so long as Black Acre is used for residential purposes, and… a… Never gets married.

John Rogers: A never walks the plank.

doven: It's not fair.

John Rogers: The whole rationale behind it is interesting.

John Rogers: Usually it was… and this is pre-iPhone law… pre-iPhone law.

John Rogers: And, you have to determine if that violates public policy.

John Rogers: The government favors.

John Rogers: The promotion of marriage wants people to get married.

John Rogers: But…

John Rogers: So, if I get married, and this is pre-iPhone law, and I love my wife so much, but when I die, I convey her the property, and I say, so long as you never get married, Jane Doe.

John Rogers: They're gonna say, well, wait a second, that disfavors the promotion of marriage.

John Rogers: You have to look at what was the reason behind it.

John Rogers: is that you're my girl, I don't want you to be with anyone else. So I'm gonna punish you if you're with someone else after I die.

John Rogers: Or… Is the rationale.

John Rogers: I want to provide to you.

John Rogers: Only for as long as you can find someone that can… that can take care of you.

John Rogers: So you can have… you have this house so that you can live.

John Rogers: Because I want to take care of you. Why don't you find someone else?

John Rogers: Who can take care of you.

John Rogers: You don't need this anymore.

John Rogers: So you have to look at, well, what is the intentions and purpose behind it? Sometimes you don't know.

John Rogers: There is one essay that I've given you that discusses this.

John Rogers: This is a common law concept, really. More common law.

John Rogers: More… far, far, far, way, way before iPhones, okay?

John Rogers: And this was back in the days when

John Rogers: women were not professional. Women did not have rights.

John Rogers: They were just… Stay-at-home moms, back in the 1700s, 1800s.

John Rogers: So that is why you see, take care of the woman until she can find someone that can take care of her.

John Rogers: Nowadays, I think women can own property. I'm not sure. Someone researched that, though. But from all the… all the examples you guys give in identifying A and O as he, you know, it's pretty…

John Rogers: Interesting issue.

John Rogers: Anyways… Notice, if we go down, The purpose… Right in the second-to-last paragraph.

John Rogers: In determining whether a particular provision violates this policy favoring marriage, courts have said that the fundamental question is whether the provision has the purpose of fun

John Rogers: Coercing abstention from marriage, or two, of providing support until marriage.

John Rogers: I'll read this to you.

John Rogers: A devises 2A for life so long as A remains unmarried, then to B.

John Rogers: It's thought to have the dominant motive of providing support until marriage.

John Rogers: When presumably, a spouse will provide support.

John Rogers: And not the purpose of discouraging marriage.

John Rogers: A devises to A, or O devises to… what the A devises to A for…

John Rogers: Doesn't make sense. A devises to A for life? I think it should… O devices to A for life.

John Rogers: Devises to A for life, but if A marries, then to B, on the other hand, is thought to have the purpose of penalizing marriage.

John Rogers: So notice that, like, a determinatable language?

John Rogers: is… Providing until marriage, whereas, like, on condition that.

John Rogers: But if is more language of discouraging her.

doven: May I ask what pages it's on?

John Rogers: 318 and 319?

John Rogers: So I guess what we'll do is we'll take a break, and then there's some review problems, and then we'll get into…

John Rogers: future interests.

John Rogers: So, take a break, and I'll see you guys in 15 minutes, right?

Fatemeh Razavi: Professor, can I ask you a question during break?

John Rogers: Yeah.

Fatemeh Razavi: So, back to the Toscano case,

Fatemeh Razavi: You had said in a previous lecture, and that if there is a contradictory situation where it's determinable or conditional.

Fatemeh Razavi: To see what the intent was?

Fatemeh Razavi: So, it seemed to me that his intent was…

Fatemeh Razavi: If they don't use the lodge, it immediately goes back to, oh.

John Rogers: Why?

Fatemeh Razavi: Because of the way the restraint was written.

Fatemeh Razavi: It said, if A or anyone else sells or transfers it.

Fatemeh Razavi: so if there was any issue, they wanted to just take it back. I don't… I didn't see it as they want to do a re-entry.

John Rogers: I think that what is stronger in your argument is revert.

John Rogers: A revert is, like… connotes automatic.

Fatemeh Razavi: Exactly, which is… goes back to determinable, right? That's the future interest of determinable, so…

John Rogers: Good argument.

Fatemeh Razavi: Okay.

Fatemeh Razavi: Well done. Alright. Well, thank you.

John Rogers: Alright, I guess we get started again.

John Rogers: Do you want to know where Professor Dolmagian's class is at? I saw her last night, I forgot to ask her.

John Rogers: Is there any friends or colleagues in that class?

John Rogers: Nope.

John Rogers: Doesn't… any friends in that class know no one? You can't just, like, text someone right now and say, where you guys at?

John Rogers: No? Don't know? Don't know that side of the… Matrix?

John Rogers: I don't know if we'll take the same final as them. I haven't even talked to her about it.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: Questions from the material we've gone over?

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: No questions. I forgot, you guys are smart.

John Rogers: So impressed. I think you guys are perfect. I think you guys are perfect.

John Rogers: Perfect in every way.

John Rogers: There are some review problems.

John Rogers: answers of these problems. Okay, so someone go to Appendix A.

John Rogers: Just to check the answers.

John Rogers: But let's go through them.

John Rogers: It's on 319.

John Rogers: Note number 1, or problem number one?

John Rogers: O conveys block… O conveys Blackacre to A and her heirs.

John Rogers: But if Blackacre is used for any other purpose other than agricultural purposes, the O has the right to re-enter, retake possession of the land. What is the state of title in Blackacre? Common law, so pre-iPhone, okay? Pre-iPhone.

John Rogers: So, first off, I would… does anyone want to try this?

John Rogers: Nobody wants to try?

Avi Omrany: Professor, sorry, what page was it?

John Rogers: What is going on with you guys? 319, I've been sick! 319, 319 review problems, 319.

John Rogers: Does anybody want to do note number one? Or problem number one?

John Rogers: Very well.

John Rogers: I assume O has a fee simple absolutes, and I'll assume that.

John Rogers: A… Has a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: O to A is present possessory.

John Rogers: Her heirs, evidences fee, It's not absolute, it's limited, because there's some type of restriction on use.

John Rogers: Coupled with, but if.

John Rogers: Would be fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: O would then have the right to re-enter, which is a right of entry.

Fatemeh Razavi: Professor, can you draw these, please?

John Rogers: Draw?

Fatemeh Razavi: in it.

Fatemeh Razavi: Are you gonna…

John Rogers: sold.

Fatemeh Razavi: Pencil's perfect, so you can erase it, too.

John Rogers: Let me call my colleague, Peter Sebastian, and borrow one of his pencils.

John Rogers: If anyone's taking his.

Fatemeh Razavi: I have quite a few if you need some.

John Rogers: That was weird, you know?

Fatemeh Razavi: I have a kid.

John Rogers: Okay, alright, fair enough.

John Rogers: I don't know if either campus has a pencil sharpener.

John Rogers: So, what do you mean, draw? I meant to draw?

Fatemeh Razavi: Write the, the, like, the O to A as long as, as you're doing the problems.

Fatemeh Razavi: Please.

Fatemeh Razavi: If you could be so kind.

John Rogers: Does anybody else want me to do that? I mean, it's written right above.

Fatemeh Razavi: I'm a visual learner.

John Rogers: You better write the book.

Fatemeh Razavi: Oh, so is Aram, and so is… Other people, it looks like.

John Rogers: I mean, it's… it's drawn out in the book, those squiggly lines in the book.

John Rogers: O… You guys see this okay?

Karen Hernandez: Yes. Yep.

John Rogers: Agricultural, is that right?

John Rogers: Ugh.

John Rogers: Right.

John Rogers: So I would say, in my opinion.

John Rogers: O has a fee simple salute, A has a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, and O has a right of entry.

John Rogers: Taking the facts from problem one, I HATE absolutely hate.

John Rogers: when this happens, because I always forget what the last one was. Suppose that some years later.

John Rogers: After the conveyance, A begins construction of several residences on Black Acre.

John Rogers: O has died and devised her entire estate to be

John Rogers: What is state of title and black accurate common law? Well, it, B, can exercise

John Rogers: the right of entry at any time, since there is a breach. So B still has a right of entry, A still has the fee simple subject to condition subsequent, but

John Rogers: If B decides to enter and take back, then B would potentially have it in C simple absolute.

John Rogers: Number 3, O conveys Blackacre. O to A, and her heir, so long as Blackacre

John Rogers: is used for res… for… used… is used…

John Rogers: For residential purposes only. I think I have seen that before. I don't know. That's very strange. Somebody needs to help me, because I feel like I've seen that example before, but just nothing is coming to mind.

John Rogers: God!

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Be simple, determinable.

John Rogers: So, what is the state of title in Blackacre at Common Law?

John Rogers: I would say, O presumably has a fee simple absolute prior to conveyed, and then I heard someone say something, so what did this person say?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Said fee simple determinable.

John Rogers: Yeah, majority do.

John Rogers: Okay? Oh, it's common law, so it's fine. Let me take that out.

John Rogers: Comment.

John Rogers: And then what would O have?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Possibility of reverter?

John Rogers: Possibility of reverter, that is correct. That is correct.

John Rogers: Taking the facts, Ugh, barf.

John Rogers: Taking the facts of problem 3,

John Rogers: Okay, suppose that some years after the conveyance… A begins…

John Rogers: construction of a factory on Blackacre. What kind of factory? I'm kind of interested. O has died and devised her entire estate to be. What is the state of title on Blackacre common law?

John Rogers: Anybody want to give that a shot?

John Rogers: Whoa.

John Rogers: Let's look at this example. Okay, let's break this down. This, it's the exact example, except A breached.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: So what happens if A breaches? Where does it go? Where does the property go?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: goes back to O.

John Rogers: goes back to Owen, then what would O have?

John Rogers: Interest. If A breaches, what does O have?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Pretty simple, absolutely.

John Rogers: Correct, but O unfortunately died. O's throat was slit, so B took over. So what does… be have.

Karen Hernandez: Be simple, absolute.

John Rogers: That's correct!

John Rogers: B has a phi, simple, absolute.

John Rogers: Oak conveys Greenacre to… Finger Lakes Land Trust?

John Rogers: Finger Lakes?

John Rogers: This seems kind of advanced right now. Hold on.

John Rogers: That's too advanced right now.

John Rogers: Skip it, it's too advanced. Oak conveys Wise Acre.

John Rogers: Wise Acre.

John Rogers: Okay…

John Rogers: Okay…

John Rogers: Number 6, does anyone give number 6 a chance, a shot, or do I have to do it myself?

John Rogers: It's a promise. Did we discuss promises? No, hold on, this says on behalf… this is a covenant.

John Rogers: That's a covenant.

John Rogers: That's a covenant.

John Rogers: next semester.

John Rogers: 5 and 6 are next semester.

John Rogers: And 7.

John Rogers: Taking the facts, next semester.

John Rogers: 8?

John Rogers: Oak conveys Whiteacre.

John Rogers: 2A and his heirs.

John Rogers: HIS heirs.

John Rogers: But, if A ever drinks alcohol… Alcohol…

John Rogers: Ever drinks alcohol or alcoholic beverages?

John Rogers: That's like saying if A ever drinks a drink, or two or more, Ha!

John Rogers: Why not just say ever drinks alcohol? What is the purpose of saying, or if A ever drinks alcohol or alcoholic beverages? Like…

John Rogers: A beverage that contains alcohol?

John Rogers: Or is this rubbing alcohol?

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: Weird.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Amazing.

John Rogers: For example… Huh?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Probably is, like, a mixed drink, like… Alcohol separate, alcoholic beverage, like…

John Rogers: Isn't that alcohol?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Technically, yeah.

John Rogers: These authors don't know how to party. I don't think they understand the concept.

John Rogers: Then to be and her heirs.

John Rogers: I just want to break this down into what everybody has.

John Rogers: First.

John Rogers: So, presumably, O has a feasible absolute. A has what?

doven: Is it a fee?

Sennett Devermont: A shifting executory interest?

John Rogers: Oh, man.

Avi Omrany: Galore!

Avi Omrany: Is it fee simple subject to condition con… subject to condition subsequent?

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: But someone did see… say something about an executive interest, and they said it right. What was that? What… what did… what'd you say?

John Rogers: You said that one.

Sennett Devermont: Ex… Executory interest.

John Rogers: What was it? First part?

Sennett Devermont: Shifting.

John Rogers: Shifting, that is correct. I would just say Executive Ranchers, but you are correct.

John Rogers: We haven't learned that yet in V simple absolute.

doven: So, I want to ask a question. So, to he and the answers, P simple, subsequent, because is it and his heirs?

John Rogers: 2A and his heirs.

doven: So that's fee simple subsequent.

John Rogers: Well, it's a fee, right?

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: Oh, I'm sorry.

John Rogers: Be simple, subject to executory limitation.

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: My apologies, yes.

John Rogers: My apologies.

John Rogers: So… This is interesting, and I'm not sure how the book is going to address this.

John Rogers: But, let's see.

John Rogers: Later, B executes, so it's B executes and delivers a deed purporting to convey her interest in Whiteacre to C. Okay, so then C…

John Rogers: How's what?

Aram Harutyunyan: It's a future entrance.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Huh.

John Rogers: Well, okay, just let's look at this. What… read the screen. B equals what?

John Rogers: Executory interest in fee simple absolute.

John Rogers: B, cells… Whatever she has to see. What does C have?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: P, simple, absolute.

John Rogers: C? B equals… and then there's squiggly lines there, what does that say?

Amir Akbari: Executory interests?

John Rogers: Yeah, so B sells what B has, which is an executor interest, to C as in Charlie. So…

John Rogers: C as in Charlie, or Clarissa.

John Rogers: Has an executor interest.

John Rogers: In phi simple absolute.

John Rogers: Cope.

John Rogers: later still, Why does it say later still? Why does it say afterwards?

John Rogers: Later still, Huh.

John Rogers: A drinks whiskey and gets drunk.

John Rogers: So, Someone did say the answer, but… I told them to read

John Rogers: B equals, so what was your original answer?

Amir Akbari: Please simple absolute.

John Rogers: Yeah, C eventually then has a fee simple absolute, because at breach, A breaches.

John Rogers: it would then automatically, C would divest A and take it, and V simple absolute.

doven: So, the breach would be feasible, absolute, just like with the, the one earlier where he died, so, at the end, so they get the entire state.

John Rogers: Yeah, I mean…

John Rogers: C, B had an executory interest in fee simple absolute, the executory interest will take it from A if there's ever a breach, B sold their interest to C, so C, whatever C has whatever B has, and then, once A breaches.

John Rogers: C takes it. C has it, free and clear, fee simple absolute, bing, boom.

John Rogers: So, just a note.

John Rogers: This is something kind of interesting.

John Rogers: And this is, rabbit hole.

John Rogers: And you, you want to, you want to, be very cognizant of this.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: that… This fee-simple executor limitation, notice this. It doesn't say O to A and his heirs, but if alcohol

John Rogers: If alcohol is ever drank, or anyone consumes alcohol, it says if A… drinks alcohol.

John Rogers: You see that?

John Rogers: Do you see that?

John Rogers: A.

John Rogers: Which means this.

John Rogers: What happens if A dies and A never had a drink? What happens? Does anybody know?

Amir Akbari: I think it stayed the same, the condition stayed the same for the B, no?

John Rogers: No, it wouldn't go… I mean, look… This is a feat.

Karen Hernandez: It would go back to O.

John Rogers: But there was never a breach?

Karen Hernandez: But it…

Yessenia Soria: It's funny because.

Karen Hernandez: There you go.

Jude Seleck: Cheers.

John Rogers: it would go to A's heirs.

Karen Hernandez: Free and clear.

John Rogers: in fee simple absolute. And B's interest?

John Rogers: or seas would fall off.

John Rogers: Because B or C's executive interest can only take it from A.

John Rogers: If A ever drinks alcohol, An A, surprisingly enough, will not live forever.

John Rogers: So notice the direction of O.

John Rogers: O's directive is if A ever drinks alcohol.

John Rogers: But what happens if A dies? There was never a breach, so A's errors.

John Rogers: Get the property free and clear, be simple, absolute.

John Rogers: Questions?

doven: There was one where it was just, like.

doven: At the end, there were two where it says, be simple, absolute, because

doven: Because it went right back, so many different…

John Rogers: Well, it was because B sold B's interest to see.

doven: God.

doven: I got it.

John Rogers: questions, because we just now officially finished present interest, and I personally think we're about halfway down the, the pit.

Amir Akbari: So, if there wasn't any breach, that's gonna go to the heirs, anytime there is errors on the, like, a common law.

Amir Akbari: And it's gonna… yeah, it's gonna avoid that condition for the rest of the heirs and the…

Amir Akbari: It's not gonna remain the same.

John Rogers: you have to remember that it's to A. If A ever drinks alcohol.

John Rogers: It doesn't say if alcohol… anyone ever drinks alcohol on Black Acre. It's if A consumes alcohol. A will not live forever, I don't think, unless they're perfect, and no one is perfect except me.

John Rogers: And I won't even live forever, believe it or not.

John Rogers: So…

Amir Akbari: Since C here, A here breached, it's gonna take that to the C, right? And the condition, it's gonna continue to the C2, right?

John Rogers: C, as long as… C will only get it if A, while A is alive.

John Rogers: alcohol.

Amir Akbari: And the condition is the same for the C. If the A breaches.

John Rogers: Yep.

John Rogers: A… I'm sorry, B or C, they will only get it if A consumes alcohol.

John Rogers: That's it.

Amir Akbari: And… but they have also the same condition.

John Rogers: Well, yes.

Amir Akbari: that bridge.

John Rogers: B sold to C. C took whatever.

Amir Akbari: be had.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

John Rogers: So you'll look back at this part and say, this part's actually easy, because we're going to get into some really dense stuff now.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

John Rogers: Now, I've been going very slow with you guys, because I just…

John Rogers: need you guys to know this, so we're a little behind, but I'll still go very slow.

John Rogers: We are now going into future.

John Rogers: interests.

John Rogers: So this is not what someone has now, it's what they potentially could get later.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: This is what people hate the most, okay? So, for the next 2 to 3 weeks.

John Rogers: Constantly get complaints on this, okay?

John Rogers: I think we're about halfway down the dive, in my opinion.

John Rogers: So, we are analyzing.

John Rogers: Everyone except A.

John Rogers: So we want to know what future interest O has. We want to know what future interest B, C, and D have.

John Rogers: I've been going through the same examples for, like, 12 years, okay? So it hasn't changed. So you probably go in my notes, I'm probably gonna have the same examples.

John Rogers: Because I want you guys to know the very easy, basic example, because if you master that.

John Rogers: Be in good shape, right?

John Rogers: Here we go.

John Rogers: I'm gonna share my screen, so I won't be able to see your guys' faces, or…

John Rogers: blubber on your neck, or whatever it is.

John Rogers: So, I'm gonna delete this. So, we are now going over future interests, okay? Future interest. So, it's O…

John Rogers: to A… to be… to C, and potentially D and E.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So we're really focused on these people, okay? So if you look at that chart I gave you guys.

John Rogers: in my email.

John Rogers: By the way, shoot me a reminder, if you can, I'll send all prior student final exam answers that are… that were real student final exam answers that… that wrote final exams

John Rogers: prior to COVID, so when they had 1 hour to do it. So, please remember to text me to remind me to send it to you guys.

John Rogers: So we are not looking at A, because as we look at that graph, A is what A has now, O2A. What is A on? A has a present interest? We're looking at O,

John Rogers: B, C, D?

John Rogers: So… there are… I forget what my notes go into first. Remainders, okay? A remainder, okay?

John Rogers: A remainder is, a future interest.

John Rogers: This is off memory, and a grantee

John Rogers: Now, notice it's a grantee, not grantor, grantee, so it's B, C, D, A, B, C, D, E, whatever.

John Rogers: And a grantee that is capable

John Rogers: But not certain of becoming possessory upon

John Rogers: Ugh, the natural expiration of the prior estate. Notice this. I'm gonna catch you big time. I'm gonna catch you big time. Notice it says natural expiration.

John Rogers: What does that tell you?

John Rogers: What is natural expiration?

John Rogers: deaths.

John Rogers: Death.

John Rogers: So, notice.

John Rogers: A remainder will never follow a B.

John Rogers: Because of fee.

John Rogers: Does not have a natural.

John Rogers: expiration.

John Rogers: So if you see that A has a fee simple determinable, a fee simple subject to executory limitation.

John Rogers: A remainder will never follow, because remainders, it's natural expiration, so remainders… follow.

John Rogers: Lights.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Now, there's two types of remainders. There's vested remainders and contingent remainders, okay? So, there's vested.

John Rogers: And there's 3 types of vested remainders. There's vested, indefeasible, Vested remainders, okay?

John Rogers: And that is, like, O2A for life.

John Rogers: We've seen that before. Then to be.

John Rogers: Okay? We want to know what does B have?

John Rogers: So, once A dies, it's going to be. B is not subject to any conditions prior to taking.

John Rogers: And B is named. We know who B is. They are ascertainable. They're an ascertainable person. B, it's a good guy, or a good girl, or woman, whatever you want to call them.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: They're guaranteed to get it once A dies, so it's indefeasible.

John Rogers: Okay? Indefeasible.

John Rogers: Similarly, you could say O to A for life, then to B for life.

John Rogers: So, the first example, B has, a future interest, a vest… indefeasibly vested remainder in phi simple absolute.

John Rogers: The second part, what does B have?

doven: You said fee simple absolute for the first one?

John Rogers: I said then to be in indefeasible vested remainder in fee simple absolute. So then what does…

John Rogers: B have here.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Life estate?

John Rogers: Okay, but a glyphosate is just…

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I'm a grantee?

John Rogers: Okay, that's a… sure, but what do you identify that as?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Dude, trust me.

John Rogers: future interest? What kind of future interest does B have?

Jude Seleck: Indefeasible wasted remainder in life estate.

John Rogers: Correct! That is absolutely correct.

John Rogers: Present possessory interest in a life estate, with A being the measuring life.

John Rogers: B has an indefeasible, or indefeasibly, depending upon the source, Vested. Remainder.

John Rogers: in life.

John Rogers: So, what's gonna happen when B dies? What's gonna happen? It's gotta go somewhere, right? It's not gonna float around. Oh, we don't know! It just could, you know, go anywhere. Who knows?

John Rogers: Where do you guys think it's gonna go?

John Rogers: Where's Blackacre gonna go? Well, we don't know! We just have no idea, we can never figure this out. What's happening? Where is it? Hello?

doven: To be his life estate.

doven: Does it go back to the O's?

John Rogers: Correct! That is absolutely correct, so what would I have?

John Rogers: What's the rule for a reversion? What's that rule? What's the rule? Can someone give me the rule for reversion? What is it?

Karen Hernandez: A future interest created in a grantor that will automatically become possessory upon the natural expiration of a preceding estate.

John Rogers: So check it out! So, prior state is B, so it's automatically going to become possessory upon the natural expiration of B's debt. There's no 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th person named, so it has to go somewhere.

John Rogers: So it will go back to O. So O will have a reversion.

John Rogers: In the interest of time, I will go,

John Rogers: vested remainder, subject to partial divestment, or subject to open. There's, vested remainder, subject to complete.

John Rogers: For total divestment.

John Rogers: There's also contingent, okay? Contingent remainders,

John Rogers: There's, contingent remainder is on its own, or you can have alternatives, which I don't really teach.

John Rogers: Oh, contingent remainder.

John Rogers: Now, my former counterpart that used to teach her for, like, 40 years until she retired used to also say preserved.

John Rogers: contingent remainders, which I don't teach either. That's way, way, way in the, pre-iPhone days.

John Rogers: Okay? So I don't really teach these, but I will give you a note in the textbook about alternative contingent remainders, and then there are executory interests, okay? And there's two types. There are shifting executory interests.

John Rogers: and springing executor interests, okay? Now, these are future interests in a grantee, but the grantor has

John Rogers: In the grantor future interests, there's a possibility of reverter, right? We learned that a little bit, right of entry.

John Rogers: and a reversion. And depending upon the text, or whomever crazy person you're talking to, sometimes they say reversionary interest. I don't care about that word, though, okay? So let's go back to a vested remainder subject to partial divestment.

John Rogers: Okay? So, you want to think of this as a class gift.

John Rogers: It's going, potentially, to a group of people.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: So… O2A for life, then to, B's children.

John Rogers: B… Has one child, C.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, here's the thing.

John Rogers: O has, presumably, a few simple absolute. A has a present possessory interest in a life estate, with A being,

John Rogers: Being the measuring life.

John Rogers: And… B, it's not then to B, it's B's children.

John Rogers: C has what?

John Rogers: A vested remainder subject to open, or you can say partial divestment. The rationale is this.

John Rogers: Can be… have more kids.

Avi Omrany: Yes.

John Rogers: So… Let's supposing you're one of those bratty-only childs, okay?

John Rogers: And you got a pizza.

John Rogers: And everyone likes pizza.

John Rogers: You got that whole pizza to yourself.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: Yay! You got the whole pizza to yourself, right?

John Rogers: I'll say partial divestment.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: It's subject to open, because mom… Or dad, whoever.

John Rogers: Can have more children, right?

John Rogers: So if you've got this pizza, and you have to share it with siblings, and mom has another mistake.

John Rogers: How much pizza do you get?

Sennett Devermont: Less.

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: You get half!

John Rogers: You gotta share it with this…

John Rogers: Peasant that you call a sibling.

John Rogers: Half the pizza, right?

John Rogers: So, your interest… was… Partially divested…

John Rogers: When more people enter the class, right?

doven: So you're saying that B has one child, but B… I mean, but B could have more children.

John Rogers: Potentially, yeah.

John Rogers: So, as long as B's alive and capable of having children.

John Rogers: more people could enter this class. So that's why C Has a vested remainder

John Rogers: But subject to that interest being partially divested.

John Rogers: Okay, so A, or sorry, B will never be total, or C will never be totally divested.

John Rogers: It's just… their interest will just get smaller and smaller. So if mom has more kids, 2 more kids, so there's 4 kids, oh, God! Then you have to… you only get 25%.

doven: So, if we have a question like that, 0 to 8 life, and then the B's children, B has one child, we just put vested remainder subject to partial divestment… divestment, right?

John Rogers: Yes, C would have that.

doven: But what a beach doesn't have no more children?

John Rogers: Well, is Bee Alive?

doven: Yeah, BSLR.

John Rogers: then B can have more children.

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: But… Once B dies…

John Rogers: What do you think happens?

John Rogers: B can't have any more kids.

gevorg kulikyan: Does C get it, and phi simple absolute, professor?

John Rogers: Will… clo… yeah, kind of. C…

John Rogers: There… if there's no further children.

Fatemeh Razavi: He becomes a complete?

John Rogers: Would be indefeasible vested.

John Rogers: Because nothing can take it from C.

John Rogers: C is not subject to any conditions, there's no more people entering the class. C is named, we know who C is. C's a great person, I would assume.

John Rogers: Love that person. Question, someone's a question.

Avi Omrany: Yes, so if… let's say B has a child, and bees…

Avi Omrany: child has a child, we'll call it D, and then B's child C dies before B dies. Does it go to D, or it's only directly to the child, not the grandchild?

John Rogers: I don't know anything about that, so what's the conveyance named?

John Rogers: So you're saying if… C has a child, then?

Avi Omrany: If C has a child, D, and C dies before B dies.

John Rogers: D is the child of C.

Avi Omrany: Correct.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: What about it?

Avi Omrany: Let me, let me rephrase. Let's say B has two children, C.

John Rogers: Okay, we are kind of complicating this now, but… Go ahead.

Avi Omrany: Let's say B has two children, C and D.

John Rogers: Okay.

Avi Omrany: D has a child, E.

Avi Omrany: And D dies before B dies. Does E get anything, or it only goes directly to the child?

John Rogers: E would get whatever interest D would have, subject to C's interest as well.

Avi Omrany: Okay, thank you.

doven: Is it possible you could put under…

John Rogers: I'm assuming, but that example, I'm assuming D, let's suppose he has 50%, 50% would go to their heir, if they don't have any, or whomever succeeds to that.

John Rogers: Go ahead, what's the other question?

doven: Is it possible you could put C become indefensible if that's the remainder under… if B dies, C becomes…

John Rogers: C? Yes, so the moment if B dies in this situation, okay, if B is dead, B as in boy, is dead, someone shot her.

John Rogers: stabbed her in the throat, whatever, poisoned her, whatever you want to do.

John Rogers: B is not having any more kids.

John Rogers: So it's just C.

John Rogers: So it transposes into an indefeasible vested remainder, where it would read as if it's owed to A for life, then to C.

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, so in this situation, does it stop at C, or does the future interest keep passing down, or does it go back to O's?

John Rogers: C would have it in phi simple absolute.

gevorg kulikyan: C would have it pretty simple, absolutely, right?

John Rogers: There's no for life.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay, perfect.

John Rogers: So there's a class gift.

John Rogers: Class gifts are subject to the rule against perpetuities.

John Rogers: Vested remainder subject to TOTAL divestment.

John Rogers: O2a for life, Then, to B…

John Rogers: Unless he gets an A-plus in real property! Yeah!

John Rogers: Notice here.

John Rogers: So, O has a presumably be simple absolute, A has a present possessory interest in a life… oops, life estate with A being the measuring life. Now, B has what?

John Rogers: I'll give you a hint. I'll give you guys a hint. B, all you gotta do is just read that. Oh, I'm sorry, hold on, you gotta read this. Just read that.

John Rogers: Just read it. Read it out loud, and you have the right answer.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Bested remainder subject to complete our total divestment.

John Rogers: That is absolutely correct. Absolutely correct. Impressive.

John Rogers: Notice here, So… A has it.

John Rogers: B… Is B named? B is named. We know who B is.

John Rogers: I'm sure he or she is a great person.

John Rogers: is B.

John Rogers: Subject to any conditions they must fulfill prior to taking.

John Rogers: Does B have to do anything?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: No.

John Rogers: Unless it means sabotage C, but yes, you are correct. B does not have to do anything. B could fly to Romania and live the rest of B's life doing nothing, going, checking out castles, blah blah blah.

John Rogers: But this vested remainder that B has is subject to being totally taken from B.

John Rogers: If… C… gets an A+, in property.

John Rogers: So… C doesn't have an interest. There's no interest in C.

John Rogers: the interest is B.

John Rogers: I'm sorry.

John Rogers: unless C gets a property, And if so, then to seek.

John Rogers: Something like that. I'm sorry, I didn't… I didn't put it out all the way. It should say, like, then to see, or something like that.

John Rogers: My apologies.

John Rogers: But, it's, it's fine, whatever.

John Rogers: It kinda has to say that, but…

John Rogers: So… the issue here is that B has a vested remainder, and B's vested remainder is being subject to…

John Rogers: complete, or being totally taken from thee, If… C gets an A+.

John Rogers: That makes sense?

John Rogers: But what would… see heaven.

John Rogers: Does anybody know? What would C have?

Jude Seleck: Contingent remainder.

John Rogers: No… A contingent remainder.

John Rogers: C is taking this property, potentially, from B.

John Rogers: What would that?

Karen Hernandez: Would they have a fee simple absolute?

John Rogers: Yeah, in fee simple absolute, yes, but…

John Rogers: what type of future interest would C have? And I'll give you a hint.

John Rogers: It's right there.

John Rogers: We haven't learned it yet. We kind of did.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Because it's taking whatever B would have. I'm taking it from you, divesting you of that interest.

John Rogers: Questions so far? What I want you guys to know is just the very bare-bone basics of this. So don't go in your supplemental sources and try to attack these very complicated ones. I want you to just know the basics behind it.

John Rogers: the GED version of this.

John Rogers: The not even algebra questions.

doven: So, I'mma ask, so,

doven: So, with, you said then to B, B was, like, a vested remainder subject to complete and total

doven: divestment, but… unless C, if C gets A property, then…

doven: B becomes the feasible vested remainder, and then C, shipping as equit interest.

John Rogers: If C manages to get that A-plus in property, for one, I'd give them a million dollars.

John Rogers: I don't know if it's ever happened. I think it may have actually happened, maybe once. I think maybe I did give an A-plus to someone.

John Rogers: But…

John Rogers: If C gets that A+, then C will divest B of the interest.

doven: If A is still alive.

John Rogers: then C's interest, if C gets that A+, C would then have an indefeasible vested remainder.

doven: And the one before that, you said B dies and C becomes indefeasible if that's the remainder.

John Rogers: Yes?

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: Because in the prior one, as far as subject to open is, it's subject to more people coming into the class.

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: But once B dies, the class closes. You can't have any more kids.

John Rogers: So, everyone who's ever there becomes bested.

John Rogers: Indefeasibly best. Can't take it away from them.

John Rogers: But in this instance, this is subject… so notice how this is indefeasible. I'm getting it no matter what, no one's gonna take it from me. It's mine, it's mine, it's mine.

John Rogers: This is… it's mine, but if more people come in, then my piece of the pizza gets smaller.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: And this one is, it's mine, it's mine, but someone has the possibility of completely taking it from me.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: So, on that last example, B, has the vested remainder subject to complete We're total divested.

John Rogers: Yes, I'm sorry. Wait, hold on.

John Rogers: Subject… oh, so, indefeasible… hold on, where… why did I put this here?

John Rogers: This is not right.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yeah, I thought I was…

John Rogers: Yes, this is a vested… Remainder, subject to total.

John Rogers: Divestment. That's a problem, I'm so sorry.

John Rogers: My bad, my apologies.

John Rogers: Sorry that threw you guys off.

John Rogers: Questions?

John Rogers: Now, a contingent remainder. Don't worry about these for now, I don't care.

John Rogers: Okay? A contingent remainder. Let's look at the rule for remainder, because remainders… a remainder is either vested or it's contingent, okay?

John Rogers: Remainder, the umbrella.

John Rogers: There's two types.

John Rogers: vested or contingent. So the rule…

John Rogers: That's why you say it's capable, but not certain.

John Rogers: Because there could be some type of contingency involved.

John Rogers: And a contingent remainder.

John Rogers: Is, one, a grantee unascertainable.

John Rogers: and or… Subject to a condition that they must fulfill.

John Rogers: Okay… An unascertainable person. So, for example.

John Rogers: O2A for life, then to B's heirs.

John Rogers: B is alive.

John Rogers: who are B's heirs? So, we have O presumably has a B simple absolute. A has a present possessory interest in a life estate.

John Rogers: life estate, with A being the measuring life.

John Rogers: And we have bee's heir, or heirs. What do they have?

John Rogers: Bees alive, right?

John Rogers: B is alive.

John Rogers: Do you all know who your heirs are?

Avi Omrany: You don't have heirs until you're dead?

John Rogers: They are not identified or ascertainable until death.

John Rogers: So, B's heirs.

John Rogers: Or have a contingent remainder.

John Rogers: They are not ascertainable.

John Rogers: Now, as a cardinal rule, any time a conveyance ends with a contingent remainder.

John Rogers: you always assume, then, O has a reversion, because that May never become ascertainable.

John Rogers: Or, let's say, O to A for life, then two A's… White.

John Rogers: A is married for 50 years and in love.

John Rogers: O has to be simple absolute, A has a present possessory interest in a life estate, with A being the measuring life.

John Rogers: And, what does A's wife have?

John Rogers: Well…

Jude Seleck: contingent remainder.

John Rogers: Why would you say continue?

Jude Seleck: Because… She, if A… A dies…

Jude Seleck: she's going to get it, provided that she's alive, also. If she dies before…

Avi Omrany: Or still married.

John Rogers: Yes.

Jude Seleck: Yeah.

John Rogers: what I was getting at is… wife… Doesn't identify who it is.

John Rogers: A could divorce, and then remarry someone else, right?

John Rogers: Or die without even having a wife, divorce.

John Rogers: But they're in love, and they've been together for 50 years! Doesn't matter.

John Rogers: Since A could die without a wife.

John Rogers: The wife's interest is contingent, so O will retain a reversion in the event that A dies.

John Rogers: And A does not have a Y.

John Rogers: then let's go O to A for life, then to B if B gets an A-plus in real property. Yay!

John Rogers: O has, presumably, a fee simple absolute. A has a present possessory interest in a life estate, with A being the measuring life, right? What does B have?

John Rogers: Well, B has to do something before B gets it, right?

John Rogers: What does B have to do before B could get it?

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: They're an A-plus in real property?

John Rogers: Get an A-plus in property!

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: So it's a vested remainder subject to total divestment?

John Rogers: Subject to a condition. Got it.

John Rogers: So… B is subject to that condition. Notice it's different up here, because up here…

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: Let's see…

John Rogers: It was C to do it.

John Rogers: But C was only to take it, so that was executory interest.

John Rogers: This is… B is subject to it.

John Rogers: So, B must get that A+.

John Rogers: Prior to A's death.

John Rogers: So… B has a contingent remainder with ANP simple absolute, and since there's a chance

John Rogers: that B may never get an A-plus in property. What's gonna happen? What do you need?

John Rogers: Does the property just kind of float around? Yeah, I think it does.

Karen Hernandez: conversion to O?

John Rogers: Correct. Oh, has a reversion, just in case.

John Rogers: that when A dies.

John Rogers: B may not have ever gotten that A plus in property, so it's gotta go back to O.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: On the first example for the contingent, When will…

John Rogers: Example, right here.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yeah, that one. Where… when would reversion… when B… when A dies, or when… when B has no airs?

John Rogers: Well, yeah, I mean, B could die with no heirs. It's kind of virtually impossible, but, I mean, you'd find out who your heirs are. It's calculated, it's a different class, it's wills, trusts, and estates. I don't teach it.

doven: So… so B is contingent remainder,

doven: FSA, it gets everything if it gets that A.

John Rogers: Not sure. What was that?

doven: It gets, fee simple, absolute, because if it gets that A+, it gets everything.

John Rogers: A+, where we at the… down here?

doven: Yeah.

John Rogers: Yes. So yes, if A… if B gets that A+,

John Rogers: Okay? What's gonna happen? B fulfills the condition. B is no longer subject to the condition anymore. B fulfilled it. If A's still alive, what type of interest would B have?

John Rogers: Anybody know?

John Rogers: A's alive.

John Rogers: But B got that A+.

John Rogers: B doesn't have any further conditions.

John Rogers: So…

Avi Omrany: simple absolute?

Karen Hernandez: And defeasible vested remainder?

John Rogers: Yes, that is correct! Since they fulfill the condition, it would just be just like this. O to A for life, then to B.

John Rogers: Boom.

John Rogers: Just like that.

doven: So, A would be, vested remainder, if it's still alive.

John Rogers: If B gets the A-plus in property, and A's still alive, B has… B's interest.

John Rogers: transposes from… A contingent remainder to a Bested remainder.

John Rogers: They're feasibly vested.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: Now, I can't help… But notice that a majority of the class

John Rogers: Maybe you don't realize it is doing this.

John Rogers: I don't think you realize it.

John Rogers: But a lot of people have been just, like, doing that.

John Rogers: So there's frustration.

John Rogers: That's fine. But this isn't as bad as I said it would, right? Oh, that bad.

John Rogers: It's just gonna take a little bit of time to figure out.

John Rogers: But for some reason, everybody hates it. I love it!

John Rogers: I think that this is…

John Rogers: A pretty good time to end the class.

John Rogers: So, we will continue with lecture.

John Rogers: Once we finish the lecture on executory interest, we will get into the casebook for future interest, so anticipate us going into that entire chapter next class. Most of it.

John Rogers: And then if there's time, you will learn about the rule against perpetuities.

John Rogers: And if you ever talk to anyone that has ever taken property before, they'll always say something about that rule.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: For your weekend, or even week, I'd suggest make sure you get some sunlight, sun, get some vitamin D, and eat leaves, okay? So my doctor says, he says, John, you're gonna have no problems, all you gotta do is just…

John Rogers: Eat leaves outside.

John Rogers: Solve problems. Eat leaves outside.

John Rogers: While you are outside.

John Rogers: Do the same.

John Rogers: So what I'll do is I will,

John Rogers: stick around if you guys have questions. Otherwise, you're officially paroled. I'll try to get through everyone's essay.

John Rogers: But you can shoot me a reminder if you want.

John Rogers: Tootaloo.

Tadey Mirzakhanyan: See you, Professor.

Karen Hernandez: Thank you.

Yessenia Soria: Professor, you still want us to text you for those, past, essays from… Yeah.

John Rogers: Yeah, text me.

Yessenia Soria: Okay.

John Rogers: Love to get a text from you.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Thank you, Professor.
