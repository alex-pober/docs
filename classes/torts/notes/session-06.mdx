# Intentional Torts: Defenses & Specific Applications

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Affirmative Defenses:** Even if a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case for an intentional tort, a defendant may avoid liability by proving an affirmative defense[cite: 124, 135]. [cite_start]A valid affirmative defense acts as a complete bar to recovery[cite: 136, 341].
* **Consent:**
    * [cite_start]**Express Consent:** Can be verbal or written permission[cite: 183].
    * [cite_start]**Scope of Consent:** Consent is invalid if the defendant's act exceeds the scope of the consent given (e.g., operating on a different body part than agreed upon)[cite: 187, 188].
    * [cite_start]**Implied Consent (Emergency):** Consent is implied by law (emergency privilege) if action is necessary to save a life or prevent serious bodily harm, and the plaintiff is unable to consent[cite: 232, 234].
* **Defense of Property:**
    * [cite_start]One may use **reasonable force** to prevent the *commission* of a tort against one's property[cite: 264, 266].
    * [cite_start]**Deadly Force Limitation:** One may **never** use deadly force solely to defend property[cite: 275, 289].
    * [cite_start]**Mechanical Devices:** One cannot do indirectly (using a mechanical trap) what one cannot do directly (shoot a trespasser)[cite: 253, 287].
* **Shopkeeper's Privilege:** A shopkeeper has a privilege to detain a person for investigation if:
    1.  [cite_start]There is a **reasonable belief** as to the theft[cite: 330].
    2.  [cite_start]The detention is conducted in a **reasonable manner** (no deadly force)[cite: 330].
    3.  [cite_start]The detention is for a **reasonable time** (to conduct the investigation)[cite: 338].
* [cite_start]**Public Necessity:** If property is destroyed for the public good (e.g., to stop a fire spreading), the defense is absolute, and no compensation is owed[cite: 359].
* [cite_start]**Private Necessity:** A defendant acting out of private necessity (e.g., saving their own property/life during a storm) is relieved of the technical tort of trespass but must compensate the plaintiff for any **actual damages** caused[cite: 381, 389].
    * [cite_start]The property owner cannot eject the defendant (e.g., cut a rope) while the emergency exists[cite: 384, 385].

### 2. Key Cases
* [cite_start]**Mohr v. Williams** [cite: 97]
    * **Facts:** Plaintiff consented to surgery on her right ear. While the plaintiff was unconscious, the surgeon operated on the left ear instead because it was more diseased. [cite_start]The surgery was successful[cite: 99, 100].
    * **Holding:** The plaintiff successfully sued for **Battery**. The doctor exceeded the scope of express consent. [cite_start]The fact that the surgery was beneficial affects damages but does not negate the battery[cite: 116, 218].
* [cite_start]**Katko v. Briney** [cite: 248]
    * **Facts:** Homeowners rigged a shotgun trap in a boarded-up farmhouse to fire if the bedroom door was opened. [cite_start]A trespasser entered and was shot in the leg[cite: 251, 254].
    * **Holding:** Defense of property failed. The use of a spring gun constituted deadly force, which is impermissible to defend property alone. [cite_start]Life is valued over property[cite: 287, 303].
* [cite_start]**Bonkowski v. Arlan's Department Store** [cite: 304]
    * **Facts:** A security guard stopped a woman leaving a store based on a tip that she stole jewelry. He asked her to empty her purse. [cite_start]She sued for false imprisonment[cite: 307, 317].
    * [cite_start]**Holding:** The store had a valid **Shopkeeper's Privilege** affirmative defense because there was a reasonable belief of theft and the detention was reasonable in time and manner[cite: 330, 339].
* [cite_start]**Surocco v. Geary** [cite: 345]
    * **Facts:** The Mayor of San Francisco blew up the plaintiff’s building to stop the spread of a major fire. [cite_start]The plaintiff claimed they could have saved their personal property if the building hadn't been destroyed prematurely[cite: 354, 365].
    * **Holding:** **Public Necessity**. The act was for the public good, serving as a complete bar to recovery. [cite_start]The city owed no compensation[cite: 359].
* **Vincent v. Lake Erie Transp. [cite_start]Co.** [cite: 371]
    * **Facts:** A ship was tied to a dock during a storm. [cite_start]To prevent the ship from sinking, the crew kept it tied to the dock, which caused damage to the dock[cite: 373, 374].
    * **Holding:** **Private Necessity**. [cite_start]The ship owner was privileged to remain attached to the dock to save the ship (suspending trespass liability), but was liable for the *actual damage* caused to the dock[cite: 381, 389].

### 3. Hypotheticals & Examples
* **The "Good" Surgeon:** A doctor gives a flu shot. This is technically a harmful/offensive touching (battery). [cite_start]However, the cause of action fails because the patient has provided **Consent**, a valid affirmative defense[cite: 118, 126].
* [cite_start]**Bicycle Thief:** If someone tries to steal a bicycle, the owner can use reasonable force (pulling the bike away, pushing the thief) to prevent the *commission* of the tort[cite: 271, 272]. [cite_start]However, the owner cannot pull out a gun and shoot the thief (deadly force)[cite: 279, 287].
* **Transferred Intent (Exam Review):**
    * [cite_start]**Scenario:** A motorcyclist rides rapidly at a pedestrian intending to scare them (Assault) but swerves late and accidentally hits them (Battery)[cite: 699, 725].
    * **Analysis:** Even though there was no specific intent to batter (touch), there was intent to Assault (create imminent apprehension). [cite_start]Under **Transferred Intent**, the intent to assault transfers to satisfy the intent element for Battery[cite: 756, 790].

# Negligence: Overview & Prima Facie Elements

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Fault-Based System:** Negligence is a fault-based system of recovery, distinct from intentional torts and strict liability[cite: 398].
* [cite_start]**Prima Facie Elements:** To establish negligence, a plaintiff must prove four elements[cite: 424, 425]:
    1.  **Duty**
    2.  **Breach** (The fault element)
    3.  **Causation** (Causation in Fact and Proximate Cause)
    4.  **Damages**
* [cite_start]**Order of Analysis:** While essays should start with Duty, the course structure begins with **Breach** because it is the core fault element[cite: 484, 541].

# Negligence: Element 1 - Breach (Proving Fault)

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Definition of Breach:** Breach is established by showing that the defendant's conduct fell below the standard of care of a **reasonable, prudent person under the circumstances**[cite: 435, 475].
    * [cite_start]*Note:* This is the first and most common pathway to prove breach[cite: 525]. [cite_start]Other pathways include *Negligence Per Se* (statutory violation) and *Res Ipsa Loquitur*, to be covered later[cite: 500, 514].
* [cite_start]**Role of Jury:** It is generally up to the jury to decide if the conduct met the standard of care[cite: 448].
* [cite_start]**Expert Testimony:** When the standard of care involves specialized knowledge (e.g., medical malpractice, engineering) outside the experience of an ordinary juror, expert testimony is required to establish the standard[cite: 1322, 1330].

### 2. Key Cases
* [cite_start]**Lubitz v. Wells** [cite: 956]
    * **Facts:** A father left a golf club lying in the backyard. [cite_start]His son swung it and hit a playmate[cite: 968, 970].
    * **Holding:** A golf club is not an inherently dangerous object. Leaving it in the yard is **not** conduct falling below the standard of care of a reasonable, prudent person. [cite_start]The demurrer was sustained[cite: 981, 1010].
    * [cite_start]*Distinction:* Leaving a loaded gun would be a breach[cite: 984].
* [cite_start]**Blyth v. Birmingham Waterworks Co.** [cite: 1146]
    * **Facts:** A water main burst due to severe frost that had not occurred in 25 years. [cite_start]The pipes were built to withstand average temperatures[cite: 1160, 1161].
    * **Holding:** No negligence. [cite_start]A reasonable person acts with reference to **average circumstances** and is not liable for accidental occurrences outside of those average circumstances (unforeseeable extremes)[cite: 1166, 1186].
* [cite_start]**Pipher v. Parsell** [cite: 1229]
    * **Facts:** Three teens in a truck. A passenger grabbed the wheel; the driver corrected but said nothing. [cite_start]30 seconds later, the passenger grabbed the wheel again, causing a crash[cite: 1230, 1232].
    * **Holding:** The driver may be liable for the *second* incident. While the first grab was unforeseeable, the failure to take preventative action (warn or eject) after the first grab may be conduct falling below the standard of care. [cite_start]This is a question for the jury[cite: 1272, 1280].
* **Chicago, B. & Q.R. [cite_start]Co. v. Krayenbuhl** [cite: 1286]
    * [cite_start]**Facts:** A child’s foot was severed by an unlocked railroad turntable[cite: 1293, 1294].
    * **Holding:** The jury must decide if the railroad's conduct (locking mechanisms vs. utility) fell below the standard of care. [cite_start]This often requires balancing the cost of safety measures against the utility of the operation[cite: 1309, 1336].

### 3. Nuance & Policy
* [cite_start]**Cost/Safety Trade-off:** One can design products to be virtually indestructible (e.g., cars that withstand 200mph crashes), but the standard of care only requires reasonable safety relative to cost and utility[cite: 1194, 1197].
* **Children & Standard of Care:**
    * [cite_start]**General Rule:** Children are held to the standard of care of a reasonable, prudent child of like age and sophistication[cite: 977].
    * [cite_start]**Exception:** When engaging in **adult activities** (e.g., driving a car), children are held to the adult standard of care[cite: 976].

# Legal Process & Intent Clarifications

### 1. Black Letter Law / Rule
* [cite_start]**Demurrer:** A motion filed by a defendant arguing that, even assuming all facts in the complaint are true, the plaintiff has failed to state a legal cause of action (e.g., missing the intent element)[cite: 1004].
* **Specific vs. General Intent:**
    * [cite_start]**Trespass (Land/Chattels):** The intent requirement is merely to do the **underlying act** constituting the trespass (e.g., intending to lift one's leg onto the property), not necessarily the intent to invade rights or commit the tort[cite: 917, 1075].
    * [cite_start]**Battery/Assault:** The intent must be to cause the **consequence** (harmful/offensive touching or imminent apprehension thereof)[cite: 1377, 1408].
    * [cite_start]**False Imprisonment:** The intent must be to bring about the **consequence** of confining the plaintiff to a bounded area[cite: 1401].
* **Transferred Intent:** This doctrine applies between five torts: Battery, Assault, False Imprisonment, Trespass to Land, and Trespass to Chattels. [cite_start]Intent can transfer from tort to tort (e.g., intended assault becomes battery) or person to person[cite: 787, 805].


### 2. Exam Technique
* **Triaging Issues:** In a timed exam (e.g., 1 hour), do not argue "dead issues" or non-issues. [cite_start]Outline first to prioritize the "hot" issues (those most debatable based on facts)[cite: 589, 1041].
* [cite_start]**Identifying Parties:** Always clearly label the parties in the analysis (e.g., "Plaintiff vs. Defendant") to avoid confusion[cite: 608, 1021].
* **Problem Solving:** Do not write and problem-solve simultaneously. [cite_start]Outline to solve the legal problem, then write to communicate the solution[cite: 579].
