# Property - Session 06

## Transcript

John Rogers: Any questions?

John Rogers: So… I've received a lot of,

John Rogers: phone calls today. Probably 5 students called me today.

John Rogers: Students have written me essays, too, for the question that I sent you for adverse possession. If you haven't gotten any reply yet, I apologize.

John Rogers: The past, couple of days has been really hectic.

John Rogers: Especially today,

John Rogers: And then, tomorrow's gonna be hectic, but this weekend, I don't have any plans, so maybe I'll just get caught up.

John Rogers: Getting back to students.

John Rogers: Did get some phone calls today, from… Two to three students that… Had difficulty with tonight's cases.

John Rogers: One of them called me.

John Rogers: And… It was earlier today.

John Rogers: And I think I gave them the wrong rationale, because I read the case, and I disagree with it.

John Rogers: But, hey, what am… what do I know?

John Rogers: But I did notice the court contradicts itself.

John Rogers: So, what I was planning to do is probably… Little bit of a review.

John Rogers: And then go into the casebook.

John Rogers: What do you guys think?

Karen Hernandez: That sounds great.

maddykoshkaryan: Yes, please.

John Rogers: Fine. We're just gonna go straight into the book, then. Fine.

Agnes Gholoonian: No, please, let's do a review.

Yessenia Soria: Yeah, let's do a review.

Fatima Razavi: Review, please.

Andre Hakobyan: That's too bold.

John Rogers: Before we begin, Where is… We're people having problems?

John Rogers: And if you don't want to say it in front of the class, you could text me, you could shoot me a private message, just let me know, that way I just know what to cover.

John Rogers: If there's any specifics.

John Rogers: But I kind of would like to get an idea of what to emphasize, what things I don't have to emphasize.

John Rogers: Stuff like that.

Clarissa Terrazas: Can you go over a review of, like, last week's session? Specifically, like, the type of fees?

John Rogers: We'll do that.

Yessenia Soria: Had a little problem with hostile.

John Rogers: You mean for adverse possession?

Yessenia Soria: Yes.

John Rogers: That's.

Yessenia Soria: For the essay.

Yessenia Soria: I know, but she said it's a review?

John Rogers: Not at the whole semester, but, like.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, okay, that's fine, don't worry. I'll call you on it, don't worry.

John Rogers: Okay, fine.

John Rogers: But a review from last week, so what are you guys having problems with? Because next week, it's gonna get real funky.

Clarissa Terrazas: Specifically, like, the possibility of, like, the reverter. That's what I'm having issues with.

Clarissa Terrazas: How do I differentiate that?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, my advice… Is, the rule statements for present and subsequent future interests.

John Rogers: Will help you determine what something is.

John Rogers: So, I might balk at you the next couple of weeks. I might… I'm not gonna yell, but I'll get snarky.

John Rogers: And I'll say, what's the rule? What's the rule? What's the rule? What does the rule say? All you have to do is read left to right, that's highlighted in yellow.

John Rogers: And then break that down and see, is that what is happening now?

John Rogers: Especially in future interests, okay?

John Rogers: It should really help you, because the rule actually hints how Certain estates operate.

John Rogers: I find it very helpful.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: I'm also tired.

John Rogers: I was in a bad mood last night in my evidence class.

John Rogers: I think I'm in a bad mood tonight, dude.

doven: Can I ask a question?

doven: I sent you an email about restraint and…

doven: And I think I understand it, it's just like, if you go to, like, an essay, and you had to just cross out the, the invalid part, and just look at the rest.

doven: Right about that.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: You still want me to answer the email? I did get it, I've just been super busy. I haven't… there's a lot of people that I owe email replies to.

doven: you can just send me an email. Or… but… but I just want to say that,

doven: I was thinking, I was trying to work on an essay, and I crossed out the invalid part, and then…

doven: Just look at the… The rest of the questions.

John Rogers: Okay. Yeah, but yeah, you're right, that's what you do.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Professor, why are you in a bad mood? How can we cheer you up?

John Rogers: Why can't everyone be like you?

John Rogers: Everyone needs to be like you. Try to cheer me up.

John Rogers: God.

John Rogers: I want to give you an A, alright?

John Rogers: No, just been, I got this,

John Rogers: I had an emergency court appearance yesterday. I was leaving Glendale.

John Rogers: Glendale Court. I got there at 8.30.

John Rogers: And I didn't leave till 11.30, and I was… Jeez,

John Rogers: So I'm driving, and I'm not sure whether or not to…

John Rogers: my car was getting serviced in Orange County, so drive from Glendale to Orange County, pick up my car, and then drive to Woodland Hills.

John Rogers: I was like, I don't know. And then my friend calls me, and he says, hey, we have an emergency appearance right now.

John Rogers: In federal court. It's a bail hearing, and it's a major case. Huge.

John Rogers: major case. It was so important that

John Rogers: federal prosecutors that morning flew from New York just to be at that court appearance.

John Rogers: And I waved.

John Rogers: bond. So, haha, I made you guys fly out for nothing. But, I didn't get out till 5.15.

John Rogers: And then, and then I was late to class last night, I was really tired, cranky.

John Rogers: And then,

John Rogers: Had to drive back home, woke up really early this morning for a meeting, then I had to go turn in my car, and then I had to go to court, and then I had to drive to San Diego.

John Rogers: And then I got back an hour.

John Rogers: And then I gotta be in San Diego tomorrow.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Well, you should be happy, because you have a thriving practice.

John Rogers: Yeah… Really fun.

John Rogers: Anyways…

Vahe Baghdasaryan: to San Diego today.

John Rogers: I was in San Diego today.

John Rogers: I was in federal court in San Diego today, I'll be in federal court in San Diego tomorrow.

Agnes Gholoonian: Do you have a comfortable car?

Avi Omrany: I'm gonna ask, is it electric?

John Rogers: No, it's not.

John Rogers: It's not, like, I need a new car. I don't have a Mercedes, but I need a new one, but I keep thinking, like, I drive so much.

John Rogers: Everyone's telling me, just don't get a new car.

John Rogers: So…

Agnes Gholoonian: If you drive a lot, I would never recommend an electric vehicle, by the way.

John Rogers: I drive a lot.

Agnes Gholoonian: Yeah, it's not worth it.

John Rogers: But, I mean, I think all criminal defense attorneys, not public defenders, but all criminal defense, like, private ones, drive a lot. All of them drive. In fact, one of my friends has a printer in his trunk.

John Rogers: Got a printer in there.

Fatima Razavi: Is that Simon? Who has the printer? Because I have a criminal defense friend who has a printer in his trunk.

John Rogers: A lot of them do.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, well, I thought it might be Simon, because he's also in Orange County.

John Rogers: I don't know who that is.

Fatima Razavi: Well, now we know.

John Rogers: So that's why I'm kind of in a bad mood.

John Rogers: And I was thinking, maybe I should cancel class, but no… I'm not gonna do that.

John Rogers: I'll just yell.

John Rogers: Anyways… Is there a… Any other questions you guys have before we begin?

Yessenia Soria: Maybe if you let us out early, you know, so you could get some good rest, you know, that would help.

Yessenia Soria: Not being cranky tomorrow.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: She's looking out for you.

Yessenia Soria: Yeah, your well-being.

doven: Do you get enough caffeine?

John Rogers: I have some, coffee, but it's decaf, and I don't even drink decaf, but I'm…

John Rogers: Got it right here.

John Rogers: Anyways, enough about me. I know I'm the most important person, but,

John Rogers: Anyways, let's talk about the material now.

John Rogers: Any questions about real property claims?

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: So, I will share my screen, and then I won't be able to see you guys, so… there we go. So you can hide.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, when… someone or something is getting in a state. You always ask yourself, is it fee or life?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Is this person getting something? What is it? Is it in fee, or is it in life? And then we'll learn about term of years that's…

John Rogers: Or, like, If someone gets property for 20 years, that's a term of yours.

John Rogers: If it's in life, life, then we know that there are 3 types. Life of the grantee.

John Rogers: O2A… For life?

John Rogers: This is common law, so this is iPhone law. iPhone law. We're learning iPhone law. iPhone law.

John Rogers: There's, Parat Trevi, Trivy?

John Rogers: I think that's… can never remember.

John Rogers: And then there's, it's the feasible wise.

John Rogers: And then there are 3 types of defeasible lives.

John Rogers: There are… Determinable life esteem?

John Rogers: Gosh.

John Rogers: Life stayed subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: And then, life estates subject to executory limitation.

John Rogers: Subject to executory limitation.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: That's it. It's all the lives.

John Rogers: Anytime you see life, Gonna be something here.

John Rogers: Or is it in feet?

John Rogers: Okay, well, there's the simple absolute.

John Rogers: iPhone long.

John Rogers: Minority only, so fee tail is minority common law.

John Rogers: Not often tested.

John Rogers: And then there's… what's the third type of fee? Anybody know? I forget, I need help.

Karen Hernandez: The feasible? Feasible, feasible.

John Rogers: That is exactly correct.

John Rogers: A defeasible fee.

John Rogers: There are 3 types, what are they?

Sennett Devermont: Be simple, determinable.

John Rogers: Correct.

Sennett Devermont: B, simple, subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: Alright, condition… C simple, ugh, wait, see simple…

John Rogers: And then…

Sennett Devermont: be simple subject to executory limitation. Oh, you…

John Rogers: But notice how these… are almost identical to these. The only difference here is Life.

John Rogers: O to A for life.

John Rogers: O to A. No, I'm sorry, O to A for life. This would be…

John Rogers: Or, on condition at.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: These are the future interests.

John Rogers: So, anytime a fee-simple determinable is conveyed, O has a possibility of revert. You know what?

John Rogers: Oh, let's just say O. Who's O?

Agnes Gholoonian: Owner.

Agnes Gholoonian: That's right!

John Rogers: That is right!

John Rogers: So anytime a fee simple determinable is conveyed, O would have a possibility of reverter, and that is automatic.

John Rogers: by operation of law. It's the automatic forfeiture. So anytime a fee-simple determinable is conveyed to A, O,

John Rogers: Future interest in the grantor will automatically retain a possibility of reverter.

John Rogers: Same thing applies here as well. The only difference here is that…

John Rogers: O, in this instance, would have a possibility of reverter, because it's determinable.

John Rogers: But also have a reversion for when, A dies.

John Rogers: So, if someone has… if O has a life, if A has a life estate, O retains a reversion.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Oops, P, symbol, subject, condition, subsequent.

John Rogers: right of entry, okay? This is expressly reserved.

John Rogers: Okay? So it must be expressly reserved that O reserves the right to… Re-enter and retake, okay?

John Rogers: That's discretionary.

John Rogers: So A still has the property until O or O's heirs exercise their right to re-enter and take it back.

doven: life estate, they keep it just for life.

doven: For fee, they keep it forever.

John Rogers: It could be there forever and ever and ever until the end of time.

John Rogers: But, if we look at examples like this, okay, so let me give you an example here, okay? So…

John Rogers: O… 2A for life, so long as A uses Black Acre for residential purposes.

John Rogers: Period.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: So if we break this down, I would say O presumably has a fee-simple absolute, okay?

John Rogers: I would say, to begin with.

John Rogers: A has a determinable… present possessory interest in a determinable life estate.

John Rogers: Now, O would have what exactly?

John Rogers: Who can tell me?

Aram Harutyunyan: The possibility of a murder, or future interest?

John Rogers: It is a future interest, so O will have a future interest. O, you are.

John Rogers: Correct, but you need… Another estate, too.

Amir Akbari: reversion…

John Rogers: Correct and a reversion.

John Rogers: Because, look at this.

John Rogers: O will get it once A dies.

John Rogers: Regardless of A using it for residential purposes or not. It's gonna go back to O. But it can also go back to O sooner than A dying if A breaches.

John Rogers: So there are two types of interests.

John Rogers: Possibility reverter and reversion.

John Rogers: The dean of this school… Calls this a reversionary.

John Rogers: interest, which I'm not really sure is in this book. It is stated in the cases, but it's not anything in the book.

John Rogers: For the purposes of my exam, you'll never have to use the word reversionary, ever.

John Rogers: It's all just deleted.

Fatima Razavi: Is reversionary just the combo of the two?

John Rogers: Correct.

John Rogers: So does this make sense, guys and girls?

John Rogers: Does this make sense to the people that identify as male and female biologically, and.

Fatima Razavi: Yes.

Yessenia Soria: Yes.

John Rogers: Okay, so this is the bulk of what we have learned so far, okay?

John Rogers: This is the bulk of what we learned so far. I'm gonna delete this right here.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor, can I ask a question?

John Rogers: You may.

Agnes Gholoonian: Where does the doctrine of waste fit into all of this?

John Rogers: Okay? The doctrine of waste is not a type of an estate, okay?

John Rogers: But it's something that you… that an estate holder here For example, can assert.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay, and it can be asserted anywhere?

John Rogers: Sure.

Agnes Gholoonian: Yeah, okay.

John Rogers: I mean, just, it's a future interest holder.

John Rogers: That is going to assert that the present possessory interest holder is wasting away the land.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay.

John Rogers: Okay, so it's not its own independent interest, but it's something just to look out for on what remedies a future interest holder would have against a present business interest holder if they're not maintaining the land, intentionally damaging it, or changing the character.

John Rogers: Okay.

Agnes Gholoonian: Excellent.

John Rogers: Now, what we also learned was restraints.

John Rogers: Okay? We learned 3 types. So anytime you see something like this, a determinable state, it's usually tested here, or even here.

John Rogers: You have to look at, is that restraint valid or invalid?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: Let me give you an example. This is very commonly tested. O2A, so long as Black Acre is used for residential purposes.

John Rogers: And… a… or A's heirs never sell Black Acre. Ever.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: So, obviously, you're gonna say, okay, this is how I would break it down. I would say, presumably, to begin with, O has a fee simple absolute, okay? A has…

John Rogers: A what?

John Rogers: What does A have?

John Rogers: Oh, oh, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.

John Rogers: Here.

John Rogers: All you have to do is just kind of look at this.

Sennett Devermont: A fee simple determinable?

John Rogers: That is correct!

John Rogers: Oh.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: O would have what, then?

John Rogers: Ha! All you guys have to do is this.

Amir Akbari: a sibling.

John Rogers: Alright, just look at that. There you go. Phi simple determinable, possibility reverter. There you go. O has a possibility of reverter, okay? Now, let's look at the validity of this, because we have a problem here. This looks like a problem. This looks like a situation, okay?

John Rogers: This is a provision that completely withholds A's ability to sell, transfer, do whatever A wants to do with the property.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: It's not limited in duration. There's no explanation for it. We don't know why. Who knows why? We're just guessing. Someone needs to text A and let me know.

John Rogers: Or maybe make, like, a TikTok video, and ask A to join it, and ask A yourself.

John Rogers: So, it doesn't look like that's going to be

John Rogers: And I can't think of a way to… Assess it being reasonable Consequently, The remedy is what?

John Rogers: Well, remember my counterpart that still uses pencils?

Fatima Razavi: You erase it?

John Rogers: You don't erase it, but yeah.

Fatima Razavi: delete it?

John Rogers: You take a pencil and you do something through the words.

Fatima Razavi: Cross it out.

John Rogers: It's correct, with a pencil, that's correct.

Fatima Razavi: a pencil.

John Rogers: gear. Yes, just like that.

John Rogers: So it's gone. It's gone.

John Rogers: What happened? It's gone.

John Rogers: So this entire thing just reads just like this. There you go.

doven: And this is a fee, so you… so, cause… So,

doven: when A gives… or O gives it to A, it can go, you know, it's for a lot… I mean, for its hairs, unless… unless they violate that.

John Rogers: Yes, it will go to A's heirs. In fact, this is what could happen in a backup pattern, okay?

John Rogers: Immediately after the transfer, A sells to B.

John Rogers: What is BHAB?

John Rogers: sells it.

John Rogers: to Barbara.

gevorg kulikyan: Simple, absolutely.

John Rogers: So Barbara has a fee-simple Absolute, and Barbara can do whatever Barbara wants to do with it.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: No, subject to a conditional subsequent, still?

John Rogers: what was… what did A have?

gevorg kulikyan: Be simple, determinable.

John Rogers: Correct.

John Rogers: So, B.

John Rogers: would have that.

John Rogers: These will determine that.

John Rogers: It's just as if A dies.

John Rogers: But B, just sold it to someone, because A, got greedy.

doven: So, when A sells it to B, the fee simple to terminal passes on to B.

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: And you know what?

John Rogers: A could be A's own architect. Remember, O decides everything. Who's the shot caller?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Oh.

John Rogers: O calls the shots.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: But it's… Professor, can A sell…

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Sell… sell it, because it says it could only be used for residential purposes.

John Rogers: Yes, I'm selling it to you.

John Rogers: So long as you use it for residential purposes.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: So, A, can only sell it under the same the rules that O had.

John Rogers: A can't change it. O is the shot caller.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: He's not using it for residential purposes, he's selling it. He's…

John Rogers: O could be, like, Olivia, Olive.

John Rogers: Why would you think O's a he?

John Rogers: I mean, again, I'm offended. I'm offended that you call O a he. O could easily be a she. O could easily identify as a she.

John Rogers: Go ahead.

John Rogers: What's your question?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: like, if I were to read the essay, I'd be like, oh, like, A cannot sell this, because

Nazanin Ayenehchi: it's… it says A can only use it as residential purposes.

John Rogers: Okay.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: But then… It doesn't say, like…

Nazanin Ayenehchi: O didn't say, A, you can sell that at any time you want. Can they?

John Rogers: Well, first off, you can't sell it, was now void.

John Rogers: So, A can do whatever A wants with it. A can never, ever sell or convey more than what A has.

John Rogers: Never.

John Rogers: O gave this to you. You can't unilaterally just say, well, I have it in fee simple absolute now. No.

John Rogers: The max that someone, a recipient grantee, can have is whatever was granted to them. They can't have anything more.

John Rogers: But… so B would have this fee simple determinable.

John Rogers: But, let's get even cuter. Let's get even wilder.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, sorry, question. What if B uses it for non-residential purposes? Does it go back to O?

John Rogers: It is gone, oh… O has it now.

Fatima Razavi: Okay.

Fatima Razavi: Thank you.

John Rogers: Let's suppose it.

John Rogers: A sells to B, and includes O…

John Rogers: to B, so long as B uses Black Acre As a two-story residence.

John Rogers: Oh, ho, oh, oh! Wait a minute.

John Rogers: What is happening here?

John Rogers: Does B have… the equal amount of interest is A, Had?

John Rogers: or less.

Amir Akbari: Sweet.

John Rogers: What?

Amir Akbari: Unless…

Vahe Baghdasaryan: It's the same, no, it's still… No purpose.

John Rogers: Cool.

John Rogers: Could A have the property as a one… Story residence?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yes.

John Rogers: Can A have the property as a two-story or 3-story residence?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yes.

John Rogers: So, can B have a one-story residence?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yes.

John Rogers: Nope.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: No?

John Rogers: B uses Blackacre as a two-story residence.

John Rogers: Can B have a 3-story residence? No.

Amir Akbari: We don't know the scope of the residence, right?

John Rogers: It's two stories, I don't know what you want to call a story, alright? But it's a story.

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: Like a children's story? No!

Amir Akbari: Yeah, but if it's a three-story residence, then it's going to have some condition on the B, right?

Amir Akbari: It's less than…

John Rogers: All I want to know, does B have equal or less than what A has?

Amir Akbari: Yes.

John Rogers: less. B has less than what A has, because B is confined to residential use, and it must be two stories. Whereas A can do whatever, however many stories A wants, it doesn't matter, as long as it's still residential purposes.

John Rogers: So, in this instance, A, not all has a fee-simple determinable.

John Rogers: But A then also has a possibility reverter, and B!

John Rogers: Has a fee simple determinable.

John Rogers: It's just getting smaller and smaller as it passes.

doven: So you're saying that B, has less…

doven: Interest in A, because A can… they can do whatever they want, as long as it's residential purposes, but B has to keep it as a two-story?

John Rogers: Yeah, can't have one story, can't have three stories, that's two stories.

John Rogers: Anything else?

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, would that restraint be void.

John Rogers: What restraint?

gevorg kulikyan: the… uses Blackacre as a two-story residence.

John Rogers: Why would that be a restraint?

gevorg kulikyan: Because, let's say he wants to…

John Rogers: for she.

gevorg kulikyan: He or she, correct.

gevorg kulikyan: They…

John Rogers: Or it.

gevorg kulikyan: Yes.

John Rogers: Or a cat.

gevorg kulikyan: Too far.

John Rogers: Have you been into a high school nowadays? Jeez. Anyways, go ahead.

gevorg kulikyan: Well, if they want to, let's say, build a three-story residence, it's still for residential purposes, so it alters the property. Like, it… what's the word I'm looking for? It puts a limitation on the property's value.

gevorg kulikyan: Was that not a…

John Rogers: But it doesn't withhold sales, so B can sell it to whomever B wants.

gevorg kulikyan: Hmm.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay…

doven: So, let me ask the question. So, A, is A still feasible determinable, and B, both are feasible determinable?

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: Yes.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: Sometimes they're hand raised?

Amir Akbari: Yes.

Amir Akbari: My, as long as B uses, as a residential, It should be, okay, right?

John Rogers: Yeah? A true story.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, but it's residential, because the main condition is residential purpose.

Amir Akbari: Right?

John Rogers: Yes?

Amir Akbari: It's not a breach here.

John Rogers: No breach.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, thank you.

Amir Akbari: Got it.

Amir Akbari: And can I, can we say the fee simple, determinable?

Amir Akbari: Always the condition remained the same for forever, right?

Amir Akbari: In the fee simple determinable.

John Rogers: Well, unless I'm sure that O decides to change it, but…

John Rogers: It's… you're not gonna see that.

John Rogers: Remember, someone, a grantee that gets in interest, can never convey more than what they have.

John Rogers: It's always equal or less.

Amir Akbari: And it should be satisfied that condition, the main condition.

John Rogers: Yes, because that's the umbrella. Can't violate that main condition.

Amir Akbari: But it should be less than that.

John Rogers: Has to be lucky.

Amir Akbari: could be.

John Rogers: Or equal or less.

Amir Akbari: Whoa.

John Rogers: What else did we learn?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Waste.

John Rogers: We kind of touched on waste a little bit. Do you want to go into it? Because, as I said before, it's not an estate, it's not a separate estate, it's not…

John Rogers: like, a restraint on alienation is not in a state. You don't say, oh, A has a restraint on alienation. It's just a remedy that a future interest holder would assert to stop a present interest holder

John Rogers: From damaging the properties, because they eventually will get it.

John Rogers: Probably.

John Rogers: Hmm.

John Rogers: Let's do this.

John Rogers: Who wants to volunteer?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: All volunteer.

John Rogers: I'm volunteering.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yep.

John Rogers: Ugh.

John Rogers: O, presumably, to begin with, has a fee simple absolute. What does A have?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: As a, fee simple subject to condition subsequent?

John Rogers: Why are you saying that?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Cause it says… O2A on condition.

John Rogers: Okay…

John Rogers: Explain further.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: And maybe I'm just mixing it up with just the word condition, but looking at my moats…

Vahe Baghdasaryan: It might be, subject to executory limitation.

John Rogers: Yeah, it's so funny. I… we don't even know who's… it's just… we just have a voice. There's no face saying things, is there?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Oh, I didn't even realize, sorry.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: You see me now?

John Rogers: I can't see anyone.

John Rogers: But can everyone else see the beautiful face that matches the voice?

Karen Hernandez: Way for you.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Great.

John Rogers: So, you said it's a… it's what?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I think it's a… The feasible fee, and it's the fee simple subject to executory limitation.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Because it says otherwise.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Black Acre will… automatically revert.

John Rogers: You, so you say it's a fee. It is.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Correct.

John Rogers: P simple absolute.

John Rogers: It's not a retail, it isn't about going to her body, it's a defeasible fee. So we know it's a fee, it's a defusible fee. What kind of defusible fee? And you're saying it's…

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Okay, when I see it says O2A on condition.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I automatically think it's conditioned to subsequent, because of the language. It's not talking about duration.

John Rogers: Okay.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: But… I'm not sure.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Well… What happens?

John Rogers: What type of future interest would O have when a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent is conveyed?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: It would be a reversion.

John Rogers: Well, all you have to do is just read right here.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Right of entry.

John Rogers: the right of entry, but… okay, so is the right of entry, or as a student told me 3 years ago, isn't it a right of re-entry? Whatever.

John Rogers: It must be expressly reserved, right?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Right.

John Rogers: So, is this right of entry?

John Rogers: Expressly reserved. That this person has the right to re-enter, discretionary, whenever they please, to retake the property.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: No.

John Rogers: It does not, so… What does it say?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: It says it would automatically revert back to O.

John Rogers: So… what would THAT be an indication of?

Karen Hernandez: Can we say is.

Amir Akbari: version? Is simple, determinable?

John Rogers: I mean, I…

Amir Akbari: It's automatic.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I would love to, like, you know, have a chance to think, but… it's crazy.

John Rogers: I ask for a volunteer, someone volunteers, and people are now… Whoa!

John Rogers: If I ask for a volunteer, then you can volunteer.

John Rogers: So, what was blurted out was, this is an indication of a fee simple determinable, because this has an automatic forfeiture.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Right.

John Rogers: An automatic forfeiture does not exist.

John Rogers: When a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent is conveyed.

John Rogers: It only attaches to determinable.

John Rogers: So, we've identified that we've got ourselves a situation.

John Rogers: There's language that evidences the condition subsequent.

John Rogers: But then there's language that evidences the determinable estate.

John Rogers: So, the question is, is… What is it, then?

John Rogers: And why?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I'm not sure.

John Rogers: Okay, now I'll open the floor. So then, I'll open the floor now.

John Rogers: Question.

Amir Akbari: It's, fee simple determinable, right? Because, it's, it says it's automatic, forfeiture is, like, coming back, like, a reversion to the owner, again.

John Rogers: So then, just because it says that, It is determinable.

John Rogers: So… How do you reconcile this, though? So if this says this, and then this says this…

John Rogers: Which one is heavier than the other?

Amir Akbari: I think that, the last part is, the automatically revert back. It shows the, automatic, forfeiture, and, it's heavier than on the condition, because.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: When you have some type of contrary language, maybe there's a little bit of ambiguity, this is not hopelessly ambiguous, but there's ambiguity in a way.

John Rogers: you revert back to what did O inte to create here? What did O want A to have?

John Rogers: So what was O's intention?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: To make sure it's used for residential purposes.

John Rogers: Okay, that's the intention, but then… As far as upon breach.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: to have… Reversion to be able to get it back.

John Rogers: There's no reversion.

John Rogers: A reversion is when there's a life estate conveyed.

Fatima Razavi: Possibility of reverting.

Aram Harutyunyan: Thanks for sure.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Do you have a future interest?

John Rogers: Well, I just want to know what A has, so right now, we're talking about a present interest of what A has, but…

John Rogers: We kind of have to determine

John Rogers: what it is by looking at what remedy O wanted to have, what repercussions O wanted to have in the event of a breach.

Fatima Razavi: Be simple, determinable.

John Rogers: Yes, it looks like it, and that's my opinion.

John Rogers: Because I think the latter part trumps

John Rogers: the first part, because the latter part evidences Oh's intentions of what remedy, of what repercussions O wanted to happen in the event that this was violated, and that was an automatic forfeiture.

John Rogers: I don't want to… I don't care to go in and… and get you off the land. I don't care to do that. I just don't want you to ever have it. I want it back automatically.

John Rogers: So, it almost… Doesn't matter what is here.

John Rogers: It could be anything.

John Rogers: Because it looks like the latter part of this provision

John Rogers: weighs more heavy on O's intent. Would you agree or disagree?

Amir Akbari: Yes.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Agree.

Amir Akbari: I agree.

John Rogers: The problem is, is the book does not agree with us.

John Rogers: We will do a case, this, it's in reverse.

John Rogers: That says otherwise.

John Rogers: And I just disagree, and, you know, I'm always right, so the book's wrong. But, the book is different.

John Rogers: S.

doven: So, you would call this… Fee, simple, determinable?

John Rogers: me, John.

doven: John?

John Rogers: Rogers.

John Rogers: Both is a V simple determinable.

doven: Yeah, Becca, peaceable.

John Rogers: Don't write that on a final exam, okay? Don't say that on a final exam. Don't try to crack a joke.

John Rogers: Don't crack a joke on a final exam.

John Rogers: And then I would then say, oh, has a possibility

John Rogers: a reverter. Now, the book gives an example like this. I believe it's, O2A… So long, ugh.

John Rogers: Something like that.

John Rogers: My position… Is… this would be a…

John Rogers: Be simple, subject to a condition subsequently.

John Rogers: The book, in a note, at least maybe in the 9th edition and 8th edition, would say.

John Rogers: that this actually would constitute a fee simple determinable, and I believe one of the cases we're gonna read tonight says this, too.

John Rogers: And, you know, when people don't agree with me, I shut them out and say that they're wrong, and jump up and down, and hate them for life. So,

John Rogers: But if you were to write that this is a fee-simple determinable, that A has a fee-simple determinable.

John Rogers: That's okay. I can't mark you down, because the book says it.

John Rogers: And, unfortunately for me, I have to take the book as the Holy Grail.

John Rogers: the god of the universe, of property.

John Rogers: I just want to… read.

John Rogers: Your rationale why.

Karen Hernandez: Professor, are you saying this is the, fee simple subject to a condition subsequent because there's a right

Karen Hernandez: Right of entry.

John Rogers: Okay, let me break…

John Rogers: break this down. So, O presumably has an FSA. A, there's kind of two answers. John Rogers…

John Rogers: Says, this is a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: However… Book says the simple determinant.

Agnes Gholoonian: What do we put on the exam?

John Rogers: Ha ha ha ha!

John Rogers: I don't care.

John Rogers: I just wanna read…

doven: B.

John Rogers: rationale.

John Rogers: Why?

John Rogers: So if you were to say, oh, it's the terminal because so long as, goodbye, property was so easy, I'm gonna have a wonderful holiday break, I'm gonna go to, you know, Europe and have a great time, come back and get my grade, I'm gonna have an A-, I'm stoked.

John Rogers: I would be reading that and say, well, wonderful, but you didn't explain how this trumps this.

John Rogers: So, although the book would say you are right, You're forgetting a… You know, conspicuous gap discussion here.

John Rogers: So, hold the phone before you start going to Paris and, you know, being in Paris in, for New Year's, because you know what? I might be busy grading.

John Rogers: And I might not like the fact that you just said it's a fee simple determinable without articulating and explaining

John Rogers: Boy.

John Rogers: I say Paris because, for some reason, over the last

John Rogers: 12 years of me teaching, a lot of people go to Europe for New Year's.

John Rogers: Me?

John Rogers: I cruise up to Santa Cruz and hang out with the hippies.

John Rogers: Anyways… So, depending upon what this is.

John Rogers: The future interest that O would retain would either be a possibility reverter or a right of entry, depending upon what you concluded and why.

John Rogers: Questions?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I just wanted to clarify the reverter and reversion. So, reverter is…

John Rogers: The ability of reverter.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Possibility of reverting is if there is a breach, right?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: And reversion is upon death.

John Rogers: Yeah, but the better way to look at it is a possibility a reverter is created automatically in O.

John Rogers: When a fee simple determinable is conveyed.

John Rogers: A reversion.

John Rogers: is automatically created an O when a life estate is conveyed.

John Rogers: Or even… sometimes a fee tail.

John Rogers: Unless it's going to a third person. So, if you see BC, then that might be a little bit problematic. It's not automatic.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: So we don't have reversion… I mean, yeah, we wouldn't. Okay.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I was gonna ask, we don't have a version for FreeSimple, but it's… it's forever, so… Okay.

John Rogers: For a P simple, absolute.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yes.

John Rogers: That's everything. You get everything.

doven: Can I… oh, sorry.

John Rogers: Yes.

doven: Can I ask a question? So, for fee, simple, subsequent, unconditional subsequent, is there, is that,

doven: Right of entry.

John Rogers: Yes.

doven: Thank you.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, for the last question, you said, depending upon what we conclude, how do we… how do you want us to conclude that? What would you like us to write, exactly?

John Rogers: Well, it's, you know, I'm kind of my way or the highway.

John Rogers: Because I'm perfect, And I think the book is wrong.

Fatima Razavi: Can you give me a perfect example of how you'd like us to conclude?

John Rogers: I personally, if I looked at that, there's no one that will convince me that this is not.

John Rogers: a fee-simple subject to a condition subsequent, but maybe I should start researching this. So, me, on a final exam, if you were to say that this is a fee-simple subject to a condition subsequent.

John Rogers: Fine by me.

Fatima Razavi: And we would say nothing about so long ass, and just kind of avoid it.

John Rogers: Well, the problem is, is you have to, you can't, it's so glaring, you have to.

Fatima Razavi: So you want me to address that, but say that the owner's intent was…

John Rogers: Well, first off, You gotta identify the situation.

John Rogers: Because we have a situation here.

John Rogers: So there's contrary language in this.

John Rogers: Contrary because of this, it's contrary also because of this, for these reasons. Then you say, well, when there's ambiguity.

John Rogers: You want to default, then, to the grantor's intent.

John Rogers: And what did O intend to create, and why?

John Rogers: So, so long as… Has this durational time limitation.

John Rogers: But, the problem, though, is that upon breach.

John Rogers: The right to re-enter and retake, Is a discretionary measure.

John Rogers: So maybe O didn't want to punish A, With an automatic forfeiture.

John Rogers: And instead, just wanted to exercise the power of termination, Whenever they see fit.

Fatima Razavi: Thank you.

doven: Pastor, can I see that feasible Determinable chop board again?

John Rogers: It's really good.

John Rogers: It's so good, because I made it.

doven: Can I see the other one? The one we did before?

John Rogers: Where?

doven: Yeah, unconditioned. Oh, okay.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: Now, if you really, REALLY want to get cute.

John Rogers: You'd say John Rogers would call this a fee-simple determinable in majority jurisdictions.

John Rogers: Because minority jurisdictions don't, like California, does not recognize the the simple determinable

John Rogers: It's only a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Ladies and germs is in my notes.

John Rogers: Questions?

John Rogers: You gotta know this stuff. You gotta know this, because next week it's gonna get awful.

John Rogers: The next 3 classes, it's gonna be pretty bad.

John Rogers: I don't want to scare you, but it's not gonna be… it's not gonna… we're about midway in the…

John Rogers: We're midway when it comes to rock bottom.

John Rogers: I think we are about 40% down.

John Rogers: So it's not THAT bad, right?

John Rogers: It's not that bad, right?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I don't think we're down, I just feel like we just have to take it slow.

John Rogers: I think we're down, but we're gonna get way… we're gonna… we're gonna hit rock bottom in a couple weeks, but just… this is not hard in comparison to what we're gonna be, getting into next week and the week after.

John Rogers: So, if you're freaking out, you're not sure, just… What's a fee simple determinable?

John Rogers: What's a possibility revert? What's a life estate?

John Rogers: Life of the grantee. What's a reversion?

John Rogers: Put the fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, what's a right of entry? I'm sure that you could memorize that until your eyes bleed in 2 hours. So what's stopping you?

John Rogers: Questions? Come on!

John Rogers: I'm here to help you.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor, I have a question, but it's a general question, it's not about what we're doing right now.

Agnes Gholoonian: Is the… is the topics that we're learning right now, the sub… like, the…

John Rogers: Love to see your face.

Agnes Gholoonian: Oh, sorry.

John Rogers: God.

Agnes Gholoonian: Sorry, I forgot to turn it back on.

John Rogers: There it is.

Agnes Gholoonian: So, the topics that we're learning right now…

Agnes Gholoonian: Are these, like, the main ideas that the rest of the class is gonna be built on?

Agnes Gholoonian: Or is this, like, a separate subject, and then we're kind of starting a new branch of it?

John Rogers: Good question. What?

John Rogers: we are covering, there's a strong probability, what we have covered tonight.

Agnes Gholoonian: will be on the final, but not everything. No, I understand, I understand the final aspect. I'm talking about, you know, you're talking about, like, this… these scary weeks that are up, like, ahead of us.

Agnes Gholoonian: Is… if… if we're not 100% certain on the… on the things that you're teaching us right now, if we do not have it completely memorized right now, are we gonna be completely lost when you start next week?

John Rogers: No.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay.

John Rogers: Because, as I said before, usually students, it starts clicking around Thanksgiving.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay.

John Rogers: track 2 months.

Agnes Gholoonian: That's a long time. I don't like that.

Jude Seleck: Professor, I have a question. I want to go back to a previous example, where there is this restraint, and A or Ayers never sells BA. Why does it become automatically invalid? Instead, the court considers it, like, for a reasonable time.

Jude Seleck: And then it becomes invalid, like, if he sells within…

Jude Seleck: 5, 10, 20 years, it is invalid… I mean, it is valid, but not 50 years, or 100 years now.

John Rogers: First off, A could be a she.

Jude Seleck: Yeah,

John Rogers: In that instance, we're not provided any limit on duration.

John Rogers: It just says, A or Azirs never sells.

John Rogers: it doesn't say A or AZRs never sell in 5 years. It doesn't say, don't sell this property, because our fear is that you're gonna kill off the wildlife, and all the squirrels are gonna die. And there's a, you know…

John Rogers: This… we need more squirrels in this,

John Rogers: wildlife, because they're becoming extinct around this area. I mean, it's… it's… what is the purpose behind it?

John Rogers: We don't know anything, it's just one group of few letters saying you can't do something. So how do you assess it and evaluate if it's reasonable?

John Rogers: Can't.

Jude Seleck: So even if it says, like, for 10 years without, mentioning to purpose, it still becomes restraint and invalid?

John Rogers: Potentially not, no, because that could… I mean, 10 years is not forever.

John Rogers: it's limited, 10 years. We don't really know why, but I wouldn't automatically just say that it's invalid just because it's 10 years. But I wouldn't automatically say it's valid because of 10 years.

John Rogers: But if you were to say 10 years, I would probably be leaning towards it's valid.

Jude Seleck: Got it.

Jude Seleck: Dink.

Amir Akbari: I have a question about the, part, you said, the, minority jurisdiction, don't go with, fee, fee simple determinable.

Amir Akbari: And, they go with, subsequent, condition subsequent. I… I didn't get that. Can you explain it?

Amir Akbari: You… it means they… they… because it's, automatic forfeiture.

Amir Akbari: They don't accept that, and they count it as a fee, like a condition subsequent?

John Rogers: It will owe in minority jurisdictions.

Amir Akbari: Like, in California.

John Rogers: where I would assume most of us are at, but, you know, I have had students in Africa.

John Rogers: South America, Nebraska?

John Rogers: But minority states, like California, do not recognize the fee simple determinable. There's no such thing.

John Rogers: There is no fee simple determinable in California.

John Rogers: They don't recognize the automatic forfeiture.

Amir Akbari: The majority jurisdictions do.

John Rogers: So, majority jurisdictions have a fee simple determinable. Majority jurisdictions have a fee simple subject or condition subsequent.

John Rogers: But minority states don't have fee-simple the terminal. No matter what is said, it's always going to be a fee simple subject to a condition subsequent, or

John Rogers: Order.

John Rogers: Subject to executory limitation.

Amir Akbari: So, anytime in the majority view, we see a fee simple, determinable, we should say, this is a fee… subsequent… condition subsequent, right?

Amir Akbari: And the same for executory, too.

John Rogers: Say that again?

Amir Akbari: Anytime we see the fee simple determinable in the majority view, we should say this is a condition subsequent, right?

John Rogers: in minority.

Amir Akbari: In minority, yeah.

Amir Akbari: So, yeah. Yes.

John Rogers: I just, I mean, to just make it easy, if you just want to be cute.

John Rogers: Okay, you want to be cute. Then just say, yeah, this would be a fee, simple, determinable in majority jurisdictions. There you go, move on. Because that implies, minority, it's not.

John Rogers: And I really don't care that you get that one little section.

John Rogers: I did care prior to COVID, when students took real final exams.

John Rogers: And those were the final exams where we only had one hour to do one essay, and there were paramedics in the parking lot.

John Rogers: people freaking out. That is a way I could…

John Rogers: grade much easier, but for a take-home final, where you have, oh no, 36 hours. Oh, I just got my finals, I'm freaking out! Let me watch a movie real quick.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor Rogers, can I just say one thing? I guarantee you, none of the students do that. With the 36 hours, we use it very wisely for the exams.

Agnes Gholoonian: I just want to say, I know it's a long time, and I know you're used to take… you had a different experience with law school, but I guarantee you that each one of us spends so much time on those freaking exams, I guarantee you nobody watches a movie during that time.

Agnes Gholoonian: Just wanna get that out there.

Agnes Gholoonian: We are suffering. We suffered like you, we are all suffering.

Yessenia Soria: stressing…

John Rogers: I…

Amir Akbari: offering to this.

doven: Yes.

John Rogers: And so… sorry for you guys.

John Rogers: Like, I'm so sorry.

Agnes Gholoonian: Think about it like this. You have an hour to suffer, and then you're like, okay, I took the exam, I'm done. We're suffering for 36 hours! And then we have to wait an entire month until we get.

doven: That's suffering.

John Rogers: Yeah, and then I got about 3 feet of exams I have to go through, and I just put them on my,

John Rogers: Living room table, and they just kind of sit there for about 10 days.

John Rogers: And then I get emails from the dean and Patty White that said, when do you get your finals in? When do you get your finals in?

John Rogers: I got 3 essays, and I have 80 students.

John Rogers: I had 80 students in my evidence class last year. 80 students in property. That's 3 essays each, so that's 160 times 3 that I read twice.

Agnes Gholoonian: You could give everybody season, I guarantee you nobody would complain.

Yessenia Soria: Blessies.

John Rogers: What's that? Excuse me?

Yessenia Soria: Or 2 essays instead of three.

John Rogers: Oh, you're gonna have 3, for sure.

John Rogers: 3.

John Rogers: I'm not gonna be nice.

John Rogers: Okay, but to…

John Rogers: here's the thing, I know it's tough, it's very stressful, but at the same time,

John Rogers: In the olden days, you did have to memorize.

John Rogers: Everything.

John Rogers: and… But I understand that you…

John Rogers: want to be a perfectionist when you have 36 hours, I get it. But here's the thing.

John Rogers: Overall, believe it or not.

John Rogers: Believe it or not, I had better quality written exams when they were timed than take home.

John Rogers: And there are some students I've had that

John Rogers: Have written very good responses, even hand-wrote, in one hour, a response very well.

John Rogers: But I still get trash as well.

John Rogers: Someone will write a final exam that's a page and a half, and have all these spelling errors.

John Rogers: I love those exams, you know why? I can read it! Yes! Whoo! Ha! Love that.

Agnes Gholoonian: Can I… can I ask something? As, like, somebody who's… you're grading our… our exams?

Agnes Gholoonian: for me, personally, I don't… I'm not speaking on behalf of everybody, but, like, for me, I am one of those perfectionists where I discuss every single little thing that I could possibly discuss, and it… that's why I use my 36 hours wisely, and I, you know, I need those, because I…

Agnes Gholoonian: Talk about every little thing.

Agnes Gholoonian: But since you're saying the essays that are written in an hour are better quality, what is… what is it about them that make it stand out?

John Rogers: I see better quality, I just feel that…

John Rogers: I don't know, maybe I'm just biased.

Agnes Gholoonian: Is it because it's shorter, you like them?

John Rogers: Yes!

Agnes Gholoonian: So don't use the 8 pages per essay, or whatever.

John Rogers: I get 15?

Agnes Gholoonian: 15 pages per essay.

John Rogers: Yes, and the school freaks out!

John Rogers: Yes, I get 15 per essay!

Agnes Gholoonian: For Torts, we had… for Torts, we had 8 pages per essay, and it really wasn't enough, personally. I don't know about.

John Rogers: 15.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

Agnes Gholoonian: Not yet.

John Rogers: Anyone else have any questions?

Yessenia Soria: So it's 3 essays, 15 pages each. I just want to make sure I'm getting this correctly.

John Rogers: Yes!

Yessenia Soria: Noted. Thank you.

John Rogers: Any questions about anything other than the final exam?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I have a question for,

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Be simple, subject to executory limitation.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: There is no possibility of reverter or right of entry.

John Rogers: Why?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Because B has a future interest?

John Rogers: Correct.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Executorian?

John Rogers: Good.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Okay.

John Rogers: Belting my heart.

doven: Well, fee, simple, executive limitation.

doven: No, possibly a reverter.

John Rogers: No possibility of birth.

John Rogers: Because it's going to a third person.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Let's open our books to page 269.

John Rogers: Many of the first few pages are historical context and background of possessory Estates.

John Rogers: And, as I said before, this is present possessory estates, so this is what A has, okay? What A has.

John Rogers: I don't care very much about… Free iPhone.

John Rogers: The fee simple, page 272. The first estate we take up is the fee simple absolute, usually just called the fee simple.

John Rogers: If you notice in virtually every essay question I have given you.

John Rogers: The first sentence is always… O owns something in fee. Simple.

John Rogers: That's a foundational fact.

John Rogers: that tells you what O can convey.

John Rogers: So, most of the time, 90…

John Rogers: 7.8% of the questions I've given you start off with, oh, owns, whatever, Charm Acre, Pink Acre, Rainbow Acre…

John Rogers: Whatever.

John Rogers: A student brought this to my attention last week. Let's go on page 274, problem number one.

John Rogers: In 1600, so in pre-iPhone days. This is pre-iPhone law, okay? What do we call that?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Balm and love.

John Rogers: That's correct. This is common law applies.

John Rogers: O conveys Blackacre to A for life, then to B. What estates do A and B have? So what does A have? Presumably, O has a fee simple absolute. What does A have?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: A life state?

John Rogers: I would say A has a present possessory interest in a life estate, yes.

John Rogers: What does B have?

gevorg kulikyan: Be simple, absolute.

John Rogers: Why would you say that?

gevorg kulikyan: It says, then to be forever.

John Rogers: So what?

gevorg kulikyan: E to A for life, and then to B forever.

John Rogers: Okay.

gevorg kulikyan: That's not feasible absolute, to beat.

gevorg kulikyan: Or is it the executor one?

John Rogers: I don't care about future… all I care about is just identifying, is it a fee or a life?

gevorg kulikyan: Oh.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, I think B has phi simple absolute.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Forever would imply it, like, to the heirs.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Passed down.

John Rogers: Let's go into that a little bit more.

John Rogers: Pre-iPhone law requires what when a fee-simple absolute is conveyed?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: O2A and his slash her heirs.

John Rogers: Do you see the word heirs?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: No.

John Rogers: So, is forever meaning forever until B dies, or forever and ever until the end of time and hell freezes over?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: To me, it means… It would be the same as… Passed down to their heirs.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: But…

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Unless the exact verbiage has to be the same. Like, it has to be specifically stating his or her heirs.

John Rogers: We can't go around it?

John Rogers: Well, common law requires heirs.

John Rogers: Otherwise, it would be… Light.

John Rogers: And I'm in the camp.

John Rogers: B has it for life.

John Rogers: Sweetheart, I want… I love you to death.

John Rogers: I'm giving you my house forever.

John Rogers: does that mean my intentions were you… it's in your family, in your bloodline, and… and your heirs of heirs of heirs will follow your estate when you die, or do I even care about that? I just care about you having it.

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: But all I know is I never said heirs.

John Rogers: Because if I said the word heirs, then I know it filters down to the grantee's heirs when they die.

John Rogers: Absent that.

John Rogers: I'm in the camp. That's a life.

doven: So B is alive.

John Rogers: The bee has a life estate.

John Rogers: He has a future interest in light.

doven: Oh, okay, so if I see that on an exam or something, or a question, forever, that means life.

doven: Life of State.

John Rogers: Not necessarily, but it's just the common law requires heirs to be.

doven: Oh, okay, common law.

John Rogers: 1600, this is pre-iPhone.

doven: Yeah.

John Rogers: And there are people that don't understand growing up without an iPhone.

John Rogers: They just… iPhone has just been in their life their whole life.

John Rogers: Anyways.

John Rogers: 277, we get into the fee tail.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Wait, I'm sorry, Professor, so what happened?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: I didn't understand what happens… when B dies.

John Rogers: when B dies, it would then go back to O or O's errors.

John Rogers: So, in that instance, O would have a reversion.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Thank you.

John Rogers: the fee tail.

John Rogers: When a fee tale is conveyed, The grantor, or grantor's heirs,

John Rogers: Will have a reversion.

John Rogers: So, if A dies without, for example, children.

John Rogers: it will go back to O.

John Rogers: And that's common law minority.

doven: Even though he's left it to be forever?

John Rogers: Well, it's… It's… it's, airs of his body, for example.

John Rogers: And someone could die without children.

John Rogers: And if the property doesn't filter to someone's children, they don't have children.

John Rogers: then it's… the property has to go somewhere. It can't just be floating around, like, I don't know really where it is. It's gotta go somewhere. So since there's no issue, there's no children.

John Rogers: It's gonna go back to O.

John Rogers: 278, 279 goes into the fee tail being abolished.

John Rogers: It is found in some far-reaching minority states that no one ever cares about going to.

John Rogers: And then we get into the life estate.

John Rogers: We do have the first case, which is in the Supreme Court of Texas.

John Rogers: I think we'll take a break, but before we take the break, I just want to say that, I've never really been around Texas. I went to Houston about 10 times last year, because I had a case in Houston.

John Rogers: Not fun or cool.

John Rogers: So, let's take a break.

Yessenia Soria: Professor, how long is the break?

John Rogers: I think I'm obligated to give you 15 minutes.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, thank you, Professor.

John Rogers: Alright, everybody ready to get started again?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Questions? While you guys have had time to, think on break?

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: So, no questions. Man, you guys are smart.

John Rogers: You guys might be one of the most brilliant, classes I have ever had.

John Rogers: Man.

John Rogers: No question.

John Rogers: Okay, I guess we'll just turn into our first case.

John Rogers: Knoth? Knoth versus Gray? Is it Knoth? Did I pronounce that correctly?

doven: What pages.

John Rogers: 280.

John Rogers: Thank you.

John Rogers: We could pronounce it my way, Knopov.

John Rogers: Knopfa? Knopfa? Knopfa! Knopfa. There we go. That's correct. Knopfa.

John Rogers: Any volunteers?

John Rogers: Are there any volunteers? Anyone know how to say things?

John Rogers: I know some people did this, Cates. They talked about it with them.

John Rogers: I think it's pronounced Knop.

John Rogers: Is that right? Knopf. Can someone correct me? Knopf?

John Rogers: not.

John Rogers: Is it not?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Yeah. I can, I can do it.

John Rogers: Oh!

John Rogers: Huh.

John Rogers: I'm so excited. Alright.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Alright, so it's NOF v. Gray, facts,

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Vada Wallace Allen left a will, devising various property to her children, and instructing that the property be passed down to their children.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Allen's will contain a provision devising her land to her son, William Robert Gray.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: The provision stated that gray was to maintain the land.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: The provision also prohibited Gray from selling the land so that it could be passed down to his three children.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: After Gray sold the land to Pulask Farms, LLC, two of Gray's children, Annette Nakanoff and Stanley Gray.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: filed an action in Texas State Court. Now, sought a declaration.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: that Alan had devised a life estate interest too great.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Which prohibited the sale.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Gray argued that Alan had devised a fee-simple interest in the property.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Gray also argued the instructions indicating the land was not to be sold constituted an invalid restraint on sale, and that the language Allen used did not have the legal effect of creating a life estate.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: The trial court granted summary judgment to Gray on the ground that Allen had ambiguously devised the fee simple interest. The matter was appealed, the Court of Appeals affirmed, the matter was appealed to the Texas Supreme Court.

John Rogers: We don't know what the Supreme Court said.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: I don't have it here.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Okay.

Yessenia Soria: Professor, can it be because the language didn't show the intent?

Yessenia Soria: The plain language showed intent that Bobby enjoyed the land during the life, but his children took ownership afterwards.

Yessenia Soria: Never mind. I can one another.

Avi Omrany: I was gonna say the Supreme Court emphasized that

Avi Omrany: You need to take in the tester's intent control, so they were basically saying, like, you don't need the magic words to say for life to create a life estate, you just need to know what their intent was.

John Rogers: Yeah, so the question becomes is… O.

John Rogers: conveys.

John Rogers: to Bobby.

John Rogers: gray.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: Bobby.

John Rogers: A.

John Rogers: Sells it in fee, to Pulask Farms?

John Rogers: I think that's what it is? Pulask?

John Rogers: when the original grantor's estate was being litigated, which I believe was Alan?

John Rogers: they claimed that Bobby, A, had a life estate and not a fee.

John Rogers: And was incapable of conveying a fee, because it's only for life.

John Rogers: And you can't convey something more than what you have.

John Rogers: And conveying a fee Is more interest than a life.

John Rogers: So therein lies the dispute. So the question is… What did Bobby, A, How?

John Rogers: Was it a fee?

John Rogers: Or was it a light?

John Rogers: Because, if it's a life, then Bobby can't sell it.

John Rogers: To… in fee to someone.

John Rogers: So let's see.

John Rogers: Now, Bobby!

John Rogers: I leave the rest to you, everything. Certificates of deposit, land, cattle, cattle, and machinery.

John Rogers: Understand the land is not to be sold.

John Rogers: But passed on down to your children.

John Rogers: What do you guys think that is?

doven: peers.

John Rogers: Well, it's modern, so you don't necessarily have to have the word heirs, so it's iPhone law.

John Rogers: Take care of it, and try to be happy.

John Rogers: On page 281, Right in the middle.

John Rogers: Okay? Right in the middle.

John Rogers: first paragraph, Where it says the cardinal rule.

John Rogers: I have this underlined in my book.

John Rogers: The cardinal rule of will construction, and that is when someone's creating a will.

John Rogers: is to ascertain the testators, so that's O,

John Rogers: Owes intent, and to enforce that intent to the extent allowed by law.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: We look to the instrument's language.

John Rogers: Considering its provisions as a whole, and attempting to harmonize them so as to give effect to the will's overall intent.

John Rogers: If we go on page 282, second paragraph… At the end, Last two sentences.

John Rogers: Alan's words… In the contested provision, so Alan is O,

John Rogers: Unambiguously, so that's without question, unambiguously, so it's precise, No.

John Rogers: Just unambiguously, refer to elements of a life estate and designate her grandchildren.

John Rogers: The petitioners as the remaindermen.

John Rogers: This is a little bit difficult because we haven't learned about remainders.

John Rogers: So the court said, I'm giving this to you, A.

John Rogers: With the… with the anticipation that it goes to my grandchildren afterwards.

John Rogers: And it lists the grandchildren.

John Rogers: So, if someone conveyed a fee.

John Rogers: That doesn't necessarily guarantee it's gonna go to the grandchildren, because the grantee could sell it, do whatever they want.

John Rogers: So, it looks like it's going to Bobby, 2A.

John Rogers: for as long as A lives, and then when A dies, it goes to the grandchildren, which would be A's children.

John Rogers: the remainder. So it's A to… it goes O to A for life, then to B.

John Rogers: And B are the grandchildren.

John Rogers: The language thus clearly demonstrates that the phrase, passed on down.

John Rogers: as used here, encompasses a transfer upon Bobby's death.

John Rogers: So what they're interpreting passed on down to mean is that upon A's death, it goes to B.

John Rogers: the grandchildren.

John Rogers: That wouldn't exist if a fee was conveyed.

John Rogers: That makes sense?

John Rogers: Kind of doesn't, because we haven't really learned too much about remainder. Remainder is following a life estate.

John Rogers: But it's a third person, it doesn't go back to O.

John Rogers: That's next week.

John Rogers: Two sentences afterwards, next paragraph. She also selectively, and sorry to be reading from the book, I just…

John Rogers: underlined it.

John Rogers: She also selectively repeated the sentiment that certain property not be sold, but passed on.

John Rogers: Or given. Or handed down.

John Rogers: To the devisee's children.

John Rogers: Thus…

John Rogers: The will, as a whole, indicates an intent to keep her property in her family, and to bequeath certain property to multiple generations.

John Rogers: So, when it was… Not to be sold.

John Rogers: Does anybody know What the court's rationale was…

John Rogers: On the provision that says, not be sold.

John Rogers: A?

John Rogers: is a party here. A, the grantee?

John Rogers: Is saying that this is a feat.

John Rogers: And the part that says not to be sold is a restraint on alienation, and it should be crossed out.

John Rogers: This Texas Supreme Court has a different interpretation.

John Rogers: What did they interpret and not be sold to mean? They didn't think it was a restraint.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: They said that it created a life estate?

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: It evidenced the intent to create a life estate, saying, you can't sell this in fee because we want it to go to the grandchildren when you die. So we have the intentions of keeping it within the family.

John Rogers: Fascinating.

John Rogers: Questions?

doven: So, not to be sold, and we saw that, and we were going to say that's a restraint, because…

doven: The grantor's telling, telling the grantee not to sell it. This goes right to the heirs.

John Rogers: Not sure what you… what do you mean?

John Rogers: Question?

doven: So, not to be sold as the restraint.

John Rogers: Well, that's what gray, A, we'll just say O to A, then B. A, that's what A argued, that this is an invalid restraint.

John Rogers: It, withholds the power to sell, and so that should be stricken.

doven: Oh, okay.

John Rogers: But this court said, it's different. The intentions were not to… the intentions behind it were not to punish the sale, or preclude the sale.

John Rogers: But rather, the intentions of keeping it within the family.

John Rogers: And we don't want you to sell it.

John Rogers: Meaning we want it within the family. So there's just good faith intentions behind it.

John Rogers: Especially when the beneficiaries, future interest beneficiaries, are grandchildren.

doven: Thank you.

John Rogers: Which evidences that it's… it's for Gray's life, A's life, not A and V simple.

Karen Hernandez: Professor, so how would that example look? O2A for life, then to its heirs?

John Rogers: Yeah, pretty much. Let me see.

John Rogers: What the hell's going on?

John Rogers: Can you guys see my screen?

John Rogers: Weird.

John Rogers: So, can you guys see the screen?

Karen Hernandez: We can.

John Rogers: So, it would be kind of like this. O2A for life, Then…

John Rogers: to be. That's kind of how it is, except it was just worded differently. It was like, oh…

John Rogers: to a… but then passed on to be…

John Rogers: And we don't want a selling the property.

John Rogers: It was something like that.

John Rogers: So, it's O2A, which someone would say, oh, that's a fee, but it says… We don't want it sold.

John Rogers: Okay, but then passed on, or passed on down.

John Rogers: passed on down is an indication that upon the death of A, it will go to B.

John Rogers: Passed on down.

John Rogers: Because you can't pass on down a fee.

John Rogers: A is the one that determines that.

John Rogers: So, passed on down…

John Rogers: indicates to the Texas Supreme Court that upon the death of A, it goes to B.

John Rogers: Which indicates that the grantor's intent was to create a life estate in A, not in fee.

John Rogers: You can't have a remainder When a fee is conveyed, and remember that.

John Rogers: Go?

John Rogers: Go to your local tattoo artist tonight.

John Rogers: Have them cut open your brain and tattoo.

John Rogers: A remainder can't follow a feat, because I'm gonna get you on that.

John Rogers: I'm gonna get you on it. I'm gonna get you on it.

John Rogers: We're gonna learn it next week.

John Rogers: Does this make sense?

John Rogers: and raised.

Amir Akbari: In this situation, can we, sell the property, or it's a fee simple absolutes, or…

Amir Akbari: What is the situation for B?

John Rogers: The B can… is… has it be simple absolute?

Amir Akbari: Okay, and there is no condition on B, right?

Amir Akbari: Okay.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

Amir Akbari: It's gonna be… after that, it's gonna be, like, if…

Amir Akbari: There is no… not fetal, it's simple absolute.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: Questions?

John Rogers: 284, Second, before Baker vs. Whedon.

John Rogers: There are several objections to restraints on alienation.

John Rogers: One is that such restraints make property unmarketable.

John Rogers: The particular land may be made unavailable for its highest and best use. Another objection is that the restraints discourage improvements on the land.

John Rogers: An owner is unlikely to sink his or her money

John Rogers: Into improvements on land he or she cannot sell.

John Rogers: An older objection is that a restraint is repugnant to a fee and void for that reason. It's just repugnant.

John Rogers: This argument begs the question that makes an alienability a characteristic of a fee by definition, then rejects restraints as inconsistent with that definition.

John Rogers: So, what I'm telling you here.

John Rogers: Alright. That's part of the rationale for restraint on alienation.

John Rogers: Okay.

gevorg kulikyan: Professor?

John Rogers: Yeah.

gevorg kulikyan: So, the… remember the example you gave earlier with… B…

gevorg kulikyan: They can only live in a two-story house.

John Rogers: Yeah.

gevorg kulikyan: So, would that not be, an alienation, because it's…

gevorg kulikyan: The owner is unlikely to sink his money into improvements on land that he cannot sell, or…

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, like, puts a restraint on him that seems… To discourage improvements on land.

gevorg kulikyan: So if he wants to build a 3-story, he can't, because he has that restriction on him.

gevorg kulikyan: Or am I reading it incorrectly? Like, am I…

John Rogers: There's nothing for the two-story. There's nothing indicating that there's a restriction, you can't sell it. Sure, you can.

John Rogers: It just must be two stories.

gevorg kulikyan: Who's meeting.

John Rogers: Sell it.

gevorg kulikyan: Billion, no.

gevorg kulikyan: But it still discourages improvements on the land.

John Rogers: Sure.

John Rogers: You still can improve.

gevorg kulikyan: Thank you for Oh, you could improve the… improve it by just not building another story.

John Rogers: Yeah.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay, I get it.

John Rogers: Let's go into Baker vs. Whedon.

John Rogers: Baker vs. Whedon.

John Rogers: Who can do this one?

John Rogers: I like this one.

John Rogers: This one's… true love.

John Rogers: True love.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: You know, John Whedon purchased a farm.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: 10 years later, John married Anna, who became Anna Whedon. Anna worked the farm with John for approximately 20 years before John died.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: John's will gave Anna a life estate in the form. This life estate meant that Anna had the legal right to use the… use and profit from the farm during her life, but that her right to the farm would end at her death.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Anna eventually became too elderly to work the farm and rented it out. The rental income was not enough for Anna to live on, and she had few other resources.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Anna filed a lawsuit asking the Chancery Court for a judicial sale of the farm. The sale proceeds would go into a trust and generate more income than Anna had been receiving from renting the farm.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Anna argued that a judicial sale was justified because continuing to use the property as a farmland was so inefficient that it qualified as economic waste.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: At the time, John had 3 living grandchildren from a prior marriage.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Henry, Baker, Sarah, Lehman, and Lau's Heck.

John Rogers: Okay.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Under the terms of John's will, these three grandchildren were the remaindermen who would inherit the farm after Anna's death.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: The grandchildren opposed the sale, arguing the farm was not deteriorating or being wasted.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: On the contrary, the farm was about to appreciate rapidly due to the significant new development in the area. In 4 years, the farmer's market value would likely double from around \$168,000 to \$336,000.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: A judicial sale now would mean the grandchildren would lose this appreciation.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: The Chancery Court found that using the land as a farm was economic waste and ordered a judicial sale. The grandchildren appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: The issue here is, if property is subject to a future interest, may a court order a judicial sale of that property only if the sale is necessary for the best interest of all parties with current or future interests.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: And the holding that we… that I got is, yes, if property is subject to a future interest, a court may order a judicial sale of the property only if the sale is necessary for the best interest of all parties.

Vahe Baghdasaryan: with current or future interests. Courts of equity may order a judicial sale of a property that is

Vahe Baghdasaryan: Coombird? Encumbered?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: encumbered by a future interest if necessary. For instance, if a life

Vahe Baghdasaryan: If a life tenant is committing waste, meaning the tenant is somehow causing or allowing damage to the property's value, a judicial sale may be necessary to stop the deterioration before more value is lost.

John Rogers: Right, that is correct. So, in this situation, in this case, we have…

John Rogers: A present interest holder, let's say life estate.

John Rogers: And this person's not gonna live forever, right? Do people live forever?

Vahe Baghdasaryan: No.

John Rogers: That is correct. They do die.

John Rogers: And… When this person dies, Some other people are going to get it.

John Rogers: So it's like O to A for life, then to B.

John Rogers: So… Initially, a man was 72 years old, and he married a 34-year-old woman.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: Or no. She… I think she was younger.

John Rogers: 17? No, 17 years of age. Married. Married at 7… so she was 17.

Karen Hernandez: He was 55.

John Rogers: That's love, okay?

John Rogers: Anyways…

Agnes Gholoonian: Is it…

John Rogers: Well, it is for me.

John Rogers: Anyways… So… She eventually, I believe, was 72 at the time of this case.

John Rogers: And she had some debt, she had creditors.

John Rogers: She wasn't making use of the land.

John Rogers: And the descendants of her husband

John Rogers: We're interested, financially in the land.

John Rogers: They had a financial interest because they learned that it could increase in value. There could be some type of good financial forecasts involved.

John Rogers: So the problem arises of what happens if she wants to sell it outright.

John Rogers: And a future interest folder doesn't.

John Rogers: Now, we're not really getting a… Really clear answer here.

John Rogers: But, in essence, this court carved out its own Way to determine

John Rogers: How the court is to reconcile this issue.

John Rogers: And they gave us a very imprecise rule.

John Rogers: That in the event that the present interest holder wants to sell, and the future interest holder doesn't, the court will rule what is in the best interest of the parties.

John Rogers: Obviously, The current interest holder has an interest, because they could

John Rogers: Pay off creditors and all that stuff.

John Rogers: The problem is the future interest holders protest that because they may lose out on potential increase in property value. It's money that they want, money, because we know money buys happiness!

John Rogers: It does.

John Rogers: Anyways… So, they don't really give us a clear answer here.

John Rogers: of what is in everyone's best interest. But they remanded it back to the trial court and said, you figure it out.

John Rogers: Anyways…

John Rogers: So, what we are extracting from this case is that the court can order a judicial sale of the property.

John Rogers: From the present and future interest holders, and just sell the whole thing, and pay off the… split it right in the middle.

John Rogers: If it is in the best interest of the parties, and you have to weigh the equities of each side.

John Rogers: And determine, is it in everyone's best interest?

John Rogers: And that's it.

John Rogers: Questions?

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, in this one, she had it in fetail, right?

John Rogers: I think she had it in detail.

gevorg kulikyan: It said, when Whedon passed, he left…

gevorg kulikyan: to his wife and all his estate, and upon her death, the estate will go to her children if she has any. And in the event she does not, the estate will go to Whedon's grandchildren.

John Rogers: But it doesn't go lineal descendants, it goes to her children, that's not a fee tale.

John Rogers: A lot of detail.

John Rogers: You could argue with me, because I believe there is a footnote in the book that says, maybe.

gevorg kulikyan: Well, I think there was a whole thing where she got married and she tried to have children, but couldn't.

gevorg kulikyan: So they were like… so she gave up. And that… and her second husband died.

gevorg kulikyan: Or something.

John Rogers: Like that. It didn't, like, mention, I was just wondering if this is, like, a… So bad, so sad.

gevorg kulikyan: That's what happens when you marry a 55-year-old at 17 years old.

John Rogers: I don't know, dude, I don't know.

gevorg kulikyan: So this one's not a fee tail, is what you're telling me.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: Plus, the detail doesn't exist, model.

John Rogers: 1972? Probably didn't. Well, it's Mississippi, so yeah, maybe it did. That's one of those, you know, one of those states, you know.

John Rogers: On those states.

John Rogers: And I do apologize.

John Rogers: would anyone protest if I… Wanted to end class now.

Karen Hernandez: No.

doven: No.

Yessenia Soria: Well, we understand you had a long day.

doven: Yeah, get some rest.

Yessenia Soria: You don't need to angry for tomorrow.

John Rogers: Next week, I don't have court, so I don't have court.

John Rogers: Thursday or Friday of next week, so I'm gonna be in such a happy mood.

John Rogers: I will be in such a happy mood next week, because I have no court on the 18th and…

John Rogers: Actually, I might have court on the 18th, but, definitely not the 19th, so I should be, pretty happy.

John Rogers: So what I will do is I'll parole everyone. I have been getting a lot of friends, so I'm really happy I got more friends. I have been getting some essays. I will get back to you. For any reason, if I haven't, at least after the weekend, just shoot me a text, shoot me another email, and say, hey, following up, hello, you there? I'll get back to you, okay?

John Rogers: But that's it. You're all done. You're free to go. You're… you're paroled. Have a wonderful weekend, and make sure you eat leaves in the sun, okay?

John Rogers: Thank you, Professor.

Karen Hernandez: Thank you.

Yessenia Soria: Thank you, Professor, have a good weekend.
