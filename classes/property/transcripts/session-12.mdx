# Property - Session 12

## Transcript

maddykoshkaryan: That's nice.

John Rogers: Alright, everyone.

John Rogers: Can anyone tell me, where we left off last week.

Mireya Gonzalez: We had just got done doing question 26, essay, but as far as material on the outline?

John Rogers: Yeah…

John Rogers: I think we finished Code 10's in the reading as well, right?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, Professor, my notes and, ouster, and then into, joint tenancy, and then some, co-tenancy…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And some hypotheticals.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): My notes end.

John Rogers: But I think we finished the reading, right?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yes, correct.

John Rogers: Okay, so when we finish the reading, that finishes the chapter, because I do the reading last, after lecture. So I think we start landlord-tenant tonight.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, wow, very nice.

John Rogers: So, my counterpart, I heard a rumor, my counterpart is done with her class. Professor Belmagian is done. They're completely finished. So…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Slacking. Slackers.

John Rogers: I don't think that I've gone

John Rogers: We're on week 12, is that right?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah…

Alice Orozco: 12? 12.

John Rogers: Okay, I'm a little behind, because usually, like, week 13 I might finish.

John Rogers: Usually week 13 I finish, but…

John Rogers: We're okay. Landlord-tenant is not hard.

John Rogers: It's, not hard. It's, it's much more practical.

John Rogers: So we're gonna skip marital, interests. You'll learn that in community property.

John Rogers: So, we will then be covering… we're gonna jump to page 471.

John Rogers: And I'm just going to lecture tonight, so you're just gonna hear me talk the whole time.

John Rogers: Any questions before we begin?

Jude Seleck: Actually, I have a question, Professor, about SA4.

Jude Seleck: So, when… Roger tried to create joint tenancy. We said it failed because there wasn't straw man.

Jude Seleck: But in this case, shouldn't be a tenancy in common, or it just fails?

Jude Seleck: For good.

John Rogers: Are you talking about an essay?

Jude Seleck: SA4, yeah. There was an, sentence that,

Jude Seleck: Owner tried to create a joint tenancy with him and his wife.

Jude Seleck: But it was common law, and so it failed, because there wasn't straw man.

Jude Seleck: And when we say it failed.

Jude Seleck: I don't know what happens. Is it common now? It is tenancy in common?

Jude Seleck: Or… Still… Owner owns 100% as feasible absolute.

John Rogers: What a really, really deep question. I have to pull it up, because guess what? I'm not sure.

Yessenia Soria: Well, on a good note, I took your little assessment, and I did good. I was surprised. At first, I was very scared. Literally scared, but I did really…

John Rogers: Okay.

Jude Seleck: Pretty hard.

John Rogers: This is ki… it… it… It's a very good question, and the…

John Rogers: answer I'm gonna give you is, I actually don't know. Under the common law, the attempt to create a joint tenancy, does that default to tenants in common?

John Rogers: I'm… not sure. I don't know.

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: Let me write that down.

John Rogers: I have to write that down, because I don't know…

John Rogers: And if I'm stuck teaching this class next year, too, I mean, I gotta know that.

doven: Question. Do you have any pointers for the final?

John Rogers: What was that?

doven: Every coin is for the final, how to prepare.

doven: Relax, what we should do.

John Rogers: Good question. I don't know, exactly what you should do, because I haven't written a final yet, so I don't know, but I have to do that. I have to turn it in.

John Rogers: Jeez, I don't know when I have to turn that thing on, let me see.

John Rogers: Hold on, the deadline, I'm gonna pull up the deadline now.

John Rogers: Oh… What!

John Rogers: Oh my god, final exams are due October 27th? That's Monday!

Amir Akbari: Don't bother yourself, just respond.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Go, go, go!

Amir Akbari: all you've gone.

doven: Really?

John Rogers: It's… they're usually due mid-November.

John Rogers: I didn't know it was Monday. I'll probably be a little late then.

John Rogers: But,

John Rogers: As far as me, I don't think that I'm going to teach, test anything that you haven't seen or heard before.

John Rogers: So every essay that we will go over, everything that I said in class, it's not going to be new.

John Rogers: So it's nothing that you are not, haven't seen before.

doven: It just might be a different set of facts.

John Rogers: So, like, Black Acre could be Star Acre. The house could be a barn.

John Rogers: I… that's the best I could say for right now, but if it's not, then I will drop

John Rogers: Some hints.

John Rogers: Just… See, and see if you catch… catch it. Catch up on it.

John Rogers: For evidence, though, I was talking to my counterpart in evidence, He wrote a hard question.

John Rogers: Oh.

John Rogers: It is hard.

John Rogers: So I have to…

John Rogers: go over a lot of essays for my other class, but as far as Saturday, I was still planning to have another review, and I have to, do both classes.

John Rogers: So I'll probably just do an essay in this class on Saturday. You don't have to go, it's recorded, let's do it later, etc.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Professor?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Are you gonna do that for your evidence students? Go over…

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Anything that's gonna be on the essay, too?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Because I'm taking Professor Sebastian, and I don't think he said that to us, so…

Nazanin Ayenehchi: I mean, do they have to watch all your videos? What do you mean?

John Rogers: What do you mean, like, said what to you? What would he say to you?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Well, you're being very helpful with property, saying that you're gonna go over everything that you were here, so…

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Are you gonna do that with your evidence?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Class 2?

John Rogers: I mean, all I can say is for evidence, is that basically everything that you will learn is gonna be tested.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: break.

John Rogers: But I think if you just go over a bunch of essays in evidence, it shouldn't be, new?

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: Poke at me, maybe in, like, another week or so.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Thank you, Professor.

John Rogers: Anything else? Any other questions?

John Rogers: No? Questions?

John Rogers: There's no questions, is anybody scared for their final?

Yessenia Soria: Yes.

doven: I am.

doven: I am.

John Rogers: I don't think it's gonna be bad for you. Anything else?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I've been working on these MBEs out on the, the quiz assessment section. I don't know if you wrote these, but some of them are tricky, tricky, tricky, tricky.

Yessenia Soria: Very true. With a good practice.

John Rogers: Yeah, someone said that before. Assessment? What assessment did you take?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): School put out, assessments for all classes. It was a, in property, it was a five-question, assessment quiz with just MBE, 5 MBEs.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): And, that was due by the Saturday.

John Rogers: You… Will not get MBEs in this class, though.

John Rogers: So it's just gonna be 3 essay final exams. You're not gonna get MBEs.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Thank you.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): That's fantastic.

John Rogers: But, just…

John Rogers: Before we get into material, MVEs are usually very hard in this class. I would say second semester property is… is… they're very long.

John Rogers: And, when… When this class used to take real final exams that were timed.

John Rogers: And the… the MBE packet was, like, an inch thick.

John Rogers: Because there was 30 multiple-choice questions that you had to do in one hour.

John Rogers: And each question went into the second page.

John Rogers: So you had, like, 60 pages.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Wow.

John Rogers: The beauty of that, though, is that they're actually not hard. The long ones are not the hard ones.

John Rogers: So don't get too intimidated by those.

John Rogers: They're actually not hard, and they contain a lot of useless information.

John Rogers: But…

John Rogers: Typically, the highest, highest score was, like, maybe 22 out of 30.

John Rogers: 22 out of 30 was usually the highest score.

John Rogers: I do… I did get randomly some students that

John Rogers: One student got a perfect score, 30 out of 30, couldn't believe it. Unreal.

John Rogers: And the same student hand-wrote their final.

John Rogers: Hand-wrote. They hand-wrote it under time conditions, hand-wrote it, and they went, A, A, A. Unbelievable.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): That's unbelievable. That's crazy. Good for them.

John Rogers: Yeah, yeah, unbelievable. Hand wrote there in a blue book with a pen.

John Rogers: In their hands.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Old school!

John Rogers: Yes, these depend…

John Rogers: and a piece of paper, and they wrote their final. They did really good. Couldn't believe it. Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

daniel Saghian: Is there any way you can send us this final, so we can, like, use it as, like, a…

John Rogers: That final was, like, no kidding.

John Rogers: I don't wanna say, it was, like, 9 years ago.

daniel Saghian: Do you know the student name, so we can, you know, find them analysis?

John Rogers: I don't know the student name, but all I can tell you is I know that she was Russian. She sat in the back, in the corner, and never said a word. And that's all I know. And she wears glasses.

John Rogers: And that's all I know. I don't know her name.

John Rogers: So when she came up to me, I was like, what, you? Like, she never said a word, never talked to anyone, just very quiet.

John Rogers: Weird.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Avi Omrany: I heard on the bar that some people have the strategy of just skipping rules against perpetuity as a whole, because they're so time-consuming. Is that true?

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: You have to remember, when you, when you take the bar, it's all about strategy. The, the multiple choice section.

John Rogers: is… Tough?

John Rogers: But, you have to think to yourself this.

John Rogers: Is it worth my time?

John Rogers: To folk… and especially next semester, when we get into recording statutes, that can be very confusing, too.

John Rogers: But when you get these complicated, rap issues.

John Rogers: Sometimes it might be best to just pick C and move on.

John Rogers: Because you only get 1.8 minutes per each question.

John Rogers: So, is your time better spent on other questions that you can figure out versus this one you're trying to figure out, but ultimately you're just gonna guess?

John Rogers: So, it could be a good strategy just to pick C and move on.

Avi Omrany: Sounds good, thank you.

John Rogers: But I think maybe you might get one question that has the rule against perpetuities in it? Maybe one.

John Rogers: But, look, you're gonna get 15 questions just on contract formation. You're gonna get 12, 13 questions just on negligence. You're gonna get 12 questions just on the hearsay rule. 6, 5, 6 questions just on homicide.

John Rogers: So, you really want to focus on those, those big… those bigger areas than little small ones.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So this area we're getting into is landlord-tenant. So 50% of the hypos I've sent you are landlord-tenant based. So after next week, you should be able to do all of them. I can go through this fairly quickly.

John Rogers: This is not hard, it's…

John Rogers: practical thinking, usually everyone's had a landlord, or they've been a landlord, so it's kind of like, there's a problem, you owe me money.

John Rogers: That's it. And what is the landlord supposed to do? What kind of lease did you enter into? Month to month? Is it a year lease? What is it?

John Rogers: So there's gonna be problems.

John Rogers: So the landlord's gonna want money.

John Rogers: And the tenant is not going to want to pay.

John Rogers: There you go.

John Rogers: So, can the tenant justify not paying the landlord? Well, this place was disgusting. There was black mold in it.

John Rogers: Or, you know, I had no electricity for 6 days.

John Rogers: Oh, I could only take a shower with lukewarm water. Ugh.

John Rogers: No one can live like this.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: I… I need hot water. I just, I need hot water.

John Rogers: But, so, is there going to be…

John Rogers: Reasons the landlord or the tenant could come up with as kind of a defense to justify not paying.

John Rogers: And, if it's found that the tenant has to pay, Can that be mitigated?

John Rogers: In some way. So, if the tenant didn't pay, let's say, \$1,000 total.

John Rogers: Does the tenant have to pay that \$1,000, or does the tenant only have to pay \$250?

John Rogers: And that's looked upon, to see what the landlord has done to try to mitigate their loss.

John Rogers: Now, in the great state of California.

John Rogers: In many instances, when you stop paying rent, some landlords

John Rogers: Will pay their tenant to leave.

John Rogers: Because the tenant

John Rogers: Will be stuck in… or the landlord will be stuck in litigation for months, if not almost a year.

John Rogers: And the tenant can just live there while the case is pending.

John Rogers: So the landlord's not getting paid for 9 months to a year.

John Rogers: And so the landlord has to think, is it even worth it? And if I can get a judgment against the tenant, how am I going to collect it?

John Rogers: Do they even have any assets or money I can even go after?

John Rogers: So… California, obviously, is not landlord-friendly, it's much more tenant-friendly.

John Rogers: We're not gonna learn California law, though. We're learning United States all-around type law.

John Rogers: But, just be careful, because if you do have investment properties in California, you rent them out, sometimes it's just a huge pain in the ass.

John Rogers: Things break, they don't pay, there's mold, and you gotta fix the shower, and the…

John Rogers: Anyways… So…

John Rogers: Landlord-tenant, the first thing that you look for when you're examining a landlord-tenant scenario is what lease, what type of lease did the parties, the landlord and tenant, enter into? Okay?

John Rogers: That is the first, thing you want to look for. What type of lease

John Rogers: did the landlord and or the tenant enter into? There's 3 types of leases. There's a term of years lease.

John Rogers: There's a tendency at will And then there is a periodic tenancy, okay?

John Rogers: Periodic tenancy, tenancy at will, and term of years. My favorite, typically, to test on is just term of years. It's easy, okay?

John Rogers: Now, the term of year's lease… Is a term with a Fixed.

John Rogers: End date.

John Rogers: So, if the lease begins, January 1st of 2026, and it's gonna be lasting 1 year.

John Rogers: There will be a fixed end date.

John Rogers: as to that one year. It doesn't have to be explicit of when it terminates, but can you find out that exact date, the fixed end date? Well, it's one year from,

John Rogers: January 1st of 2026.

John Rogers: I am going to lease your closet… for 45 days. Exactly.

John Rogers: Then, that is a term of year's lease, because there is a fixed end date.

John Rogers: When you enter, or the tenant enters into a fixed end date, a term of year's lease, notice

John Rogers: Giving notice to the landlord

John Rogers: of the tenant's intentions of terminating it at the end of the lease is not required. Notice is not required, because it has been predetermined by the parties

John Rogers: At the lease inception.

John Rogers: There is a concept called the Statute of Frauds. I don't know if that's in my notes this semester or not, I can't remember.

John Rogers: But if the lease, by its own expressed terms, exceeds.

John Rogers: one year. It's not one year more. It exceeds One year.

John Rogers: One year, one day.

John Rogers: and more.

John Rogers: It must be in writing.

John Rogers: It must be in writing.

Mireya Gonzalez: Professor, can you repeat that? I'm sorry.

John Rogers: If the lease, by its own express terms, Exceeds one year.

John Rogers: Not one year. Not just one year, but one year, one day, or more. One year, one day, and more.

John Rogers: Then it must be in writing.

John Rogers: to be enforceable.

John Rogers: If it's not in writing, it would default to, as we'll learn in a moment, a periodic lease, like a month-to-month.

John Rogers: But, it doesn't necessarily have to be a formal piece of paper where people sign. I guess now you kids today is DocuSign.

John Rogers: It's… It could be on a, you know, used cocktail napkin at a bar.

John Rogers: Written in lipstick.

John Rogers: is it in writing? Or I usually like to, like… I usually like to… to… to enter into lease agreements on…

John Rogers: I like to etch it into a toilet seat.

John Rogers: That is in writing. Yes, you etch it into the toilet seat at a, you know, a dive bar in Santa Monica somewhere. Yes, that is our lease.

John Rogers: Is that in writing? That is in writing!

John Rogers: So the sign and lipstick or whatever is in writing?

John Rogers: Yeah, it's in writing, so if I could… I'm gonna take out my lipstick, and I'm gonna write it on, a piece of toilet paper. That is in writing, is it not?

John Rogers: That's in writing!

John Rogers: That is in writing. I'm writing it.

John Rogers: I'm writing it. That's our lease.

John Rogers: You'll learn in wills, trust, and estates, where you can actually create a will on a rock.

John Rogers: Just etch it into a rock.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: I could write it on the wall.

John Rogers: I want to write on the wall. So if you have kids, and they're, you know, writing on the walls with their crayons or whatever.

John Rogers: Yes, you could literally write your will on the wall.

John Rogers: So, A term of year's lease.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: If, for example, the lease term is… Till… 2000…

John Rogers: 325, 100 years from now. It's 100 years, right? No, 2,100.

John Rogers: 25. Oh, man. That would be a fixed end date. It's 100 years, so there will be a fixed end date. A problem arises if it was, like.

John Rogers: I am leasing my, one-bedroom, home to you.

John Rogers: Until the date that the Lakers win the championship.

John Rogers: That has not really been predetermined.

John Rogers: So that wouldn't qualify as a term of yours.

John Rogers: But you can say, I'm going to lease this to you until…

John Rogers: Next year's dolphin hunting season, when that starts.

John Rogers: If there is a date where it is determined that dolphin hunting begins on this date, then yes, that's a fixed end date.

John Rogers: Or whale hunting, whatever, whatever, whichever one you like more.

John Rogers: Now, that's very common, so the first thing you want to do is determine, what is this lease?

John Rogers: The second type of lease is a periodic lease.

John Rogers: That's just… For example, a month-to-month.

John Rogers: I'm… I'm… I'm renting this place month to month. You go on Airbnb.

John Rogers: you want to… well, actually, Airbnb, if you only have it.

John Rogers: That would be a fixed end date, my apologies.

John Rogers: But if you enter into an agreement that is month-to-month, Or week to week?

John Rogers: That is a periodic.

John Rogers: Periodic tenancy.

John Rogers: So you want to look for successive periods, month to month to month to month to month.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: So, have you ever lived in a place where you say, I want to rent this month to month?

John Rogers: Maybe, like, if I want to remodel my home, sometimes I want to say I need to rent an apartment for month-to-month to live for the next 3-4 months.

John Rogers: I don't want to enter into a year lease.

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: Or you live in a place

John Rogers: And you live there for a year, and then after that one year, it then just begins as month to month to month to month to month.

John Rogers: Just notice that there are successive periods.

John Rogers: Now, notice is required to terminate the lease.

John Rogers: For a… for a periodic tenancy.

John Rogers: Typically, it's month-to-month, and you generally have to give 30 days advance notice.

John Rogers: Notice is given because you have to give the landlord time to find a new tenant and make arrangements to,

John Rogers: Locate a new tenant, and just expect of your departure.

John Rogers: Plus, they have to clean all the filth that you left behind.

John Rogers: If, for example, the tenant does not give sufficient notice.

John Rogers: They would be bound to another term.

John Rogers: So if you don't give 30 days advance notice, the tenant may be bound for another 30 days after that.

John Rogers: Following along so far?

John Rogers: Alright, wonderful. Alright, you guys are smart. You guys, this isn't so bad so far, right? It is easy. It is easy. Alright.

John Rogers: Any questions on tenancy, term of years, or a periodic tenancy?

Amir Akbari: Quick question, ATMB is, periodic, right?

John Rogers: What is?

Amir Akbari: pre… Airbnb is a periodic, or…

John Rogers: I mean, to be honest with you, I have never once used Airbnb in my entire life, and I…

John Rogers: for right now, can represent that I never will.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, but, since it has a, like, end date, is it…

John Rogers: It's gonna be a term of years, then.

Amir Akbari: Fair enough, yeah.

John Rogers: and date.

Amir Akbari: Thank you.

John Rogers: Only because you don't really know you're staying in someone else's residence? How do you know they have secret cameras everywhere?

John Rogers: You know what I mean? It's kind of like… I don't know.

John Rogers: I just stay in a hotel.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: On a term of years, you said if it exceeds 1 year and one day.

John Rogers: No, no, it exceeds one year. For example, one year or one day… one year, one day, or more than that.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Then it has to be in writing.

John Rogers: Has to be in writing.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: And if it's not in writing, it becomes a month-to-month.

John Rogers: It becomes a periodic tendency, correct?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Okay.

Fatima Razavi: The answer for a periodic tenancy, if it's a week-to-week, do they still have to give you a 30-day notice?

John Rogers: No, you give one week notice.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, so…

John Rogers: One full-term advance notice. Month to month's just easy to say.

Amir Akbari: And for the writing ones, we should satisfy the Statue of fraud on the essays.

Amir Akbari: Okay.

John Rogers: I don't like to go too far, because it's more of a second semester topic, Statute of frauds, and you… I believe you learn statute of frauds second semester contracts, too.

John Rogers: So, I don't really like to go too far into it.

John Rogers: Just… is it in writing?

John Rogers: Was this in writing?

John Rogers: Tenancy at will. Okay, a tenancy at will

John Rogers: We'll go on and on and on as long as the parties want.

John Rogers: And the only way… it could be terminated, By deaf, it could be… Terminated, really, at any time.

John Rogers: It's just…

John Rogers: Have you ever, you know, told your friend, oh, you know, you broke up with your partner, come on over, you can stay at my place, don't even worry about it, I got you.

John Rogers: Where's the fixed end date? Where's the… where's the successive periods? No.

John Rogers: So basically, what you're telling them is just, you can stay.

John Rogers: In the closet.

John Rogers: In the garage. You just cuddle up next to the cars in the garage. Here you go.

John Rogers: So, it will just endure so long, so long as the parties want.

John Rogers: Okay? And it can be terminated at any point.

John Rogers: But it is terminated upon death.

John Rogers: Definitely, and that's been tested before.

John Rogers: If the landlord, the building owner, were to, for example, sell the property,

John Rogers: Or if, for example, one of the tenants is an assignee.

John Rogers: And it gets assigned to someone else.

John Rogers: Or if,

John Rogers: The tenant is, god, what's the last one? Damaging the property. Waste. Waste. If the tenant is committing waste.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: You have to be very careful with this, because I've tested on this before, okay?

John Rogers: Because if termination is solely in the hands of the tenant only.

John Rogers: That could be a very big problem.

John Rogers: Because if I say, oh, no, you know, you're leaving your spouse, oh, boo hoo, yes, don't worry, come on over to my house, you stay in my guest room, you can stay there as long as you want.

John Rogers: If I were to say that to you, the power to terminate is only in you.

John Rogers: I didn't say you could stay in my guest room as long as you want, but I can terminate it at any time.

John Rogers: I mean, say that.

John Rogers: I vested the entire power into you to terminate.

John Rogers: Which potentially creates What?

Jude Seleck: adverse position.

John Rogers: Not quite.

Fatima Razavi: A simple absolute?

Mireya Gonzalez: Tenants in common?

John Rogers: A life estate.

John Rogers: Because it's only to you.

John Rogers: So be very careful when you invite someone over.

John Rogers: You might have just conveyed to them a life estate.

John Rogers: So, note to self, do not help out a friend in need, okay? That's the moral of the story. Do not help out a friend in need. You may just give them your home.

John Rogers: So… But yes.

John Rogers: Yes, there's a question.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, Professor, real quick. Let's say, there's a situation where So it's a joint tenancy.

gevorg kulikyan: And one of the owners rents out the property to another person, a tenancy at will.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay, and then… that person dies, whoever rents it out. And they didn't tell the other…

gevorg kulikyan: owner that they're going to rent it out. If they die, does…

John Rogers: Now, here's the thing, you need to be a little… sorry, you need to be a little bit more specific in your examples, because when you say they, I don't know who you're talking about.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay, so… so let's say, 1 and 2, there's two owners.

John Rogers: Let's just say, okay, there's 2 owners.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, and it's a joint tenancy of a property.

John Rogers: Joint tenancy.

gevorg kulikyan: Yes, and number one rents out without telling, number two, rents…

gevorg kulikyan: Allow somebody to come and live.

John Rogers: Tenant.

gevorg kulikyan: A tenant, yes. And it's a tenancy at will.

gevorg kulikyan: If number one dies, does the…

gevorg kulikyan: Ten… does that, lease terminate?

John Rogers: That's interesting, because…

gevorg kulikyan: Because number 2 has a survivorship, right?

John Rogers: Well, it's in joint tenancy, So, here's the issue.

John Rogers: It doesn't matter.

John Rogers: the new whoever succeeds could just tell them to leave. It's a Tennessee vote, it could be canceled at any time, for no apparent reason.

gevorg kulikyan: Oh, I thought the… landlord cannot cancel. I thought it was…

John Rogers: Oh, are you talking about when it's a… Life estate, then?

gevorg kulikyan: I guess so, yeah. Yeah, yeah.

John Rogers: Light… that's a… that's a bit of a problem.

gevorg kulikyan: If they said, you can live here as long as you want, and then they…

John Rogers: If it creates a life estate in this individual, then potentially

John Rogers: That's very hairy. That's very hairy. That's really, really hairy. I don't even know how to answer that, to be honest.

John Rogers: Don't know.

gevorg kulikyan: What if number two died? Number 1,

gevorg kulikyan: Did the life estate, and number 2 died.

John Rogers: Who's number one did?

gevorg kulikyan: Number one is the one that allowed the person to come in and live.

gevorg kulikyan: But number 2 dies, so now they have full survivorship right.

gevorg kulikyan: Number one.

John Rogers: then I would say, probably has a reversion.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay.

gevorg kulikyan: Thank you.

John Rogers: Any other questions on tenancy at will, periodic tenancy, or term of years?

doven: Again, if you keep your… if you have a fixed…

doven: Tennessee for a year. Do you, does that mean as a year, it could be a,

John Rogers: Tenancy, tenancy…

doven: A fixed transaction.

John Rogers: Okay, so term of yours.

doven: So, you see, after a year, and you decide to stay longer.

doven: Is… could it be… would it continue, or can… it depends on the… the, the, the.

John Rogers: It generally defaults month to month.

doven: Oh, the first month, the month?

John Rogers: Yeah, it becomes periodic tendency.

doven: Oh, okay, thank you.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Mireya Gonzalez: Yeah, Professor, I do. I'm not understanding how the term… when the termination is in the tenant, how it creates the life estate. Can you go over that?

John Rogers: The landlord can't terminate it.

John Rogers: The sole ability to terminate the lease

John Rogers: is solely in the tenant. The landlord cannot.

Mireya Gonzalez: In the example you gave, though, in…

Mireya Gonzalez: Come stay as long as you want.

Mireya Gonzalez: Is… couldn't there be a situation where you say, well, can you go now? Like, can you leave?

John Rogers: Well, if I'm investing you, all the interests to the point where you have the sole ability to terminate and I don't, stay as long as you want.

John Rogers: I may have conveyed a life estate to you.

John Rogers: I don't have the power to terminate.

John Rogers: So that's why we… just be very careful, because when you have, you know.

John Rogers: friends that need to stay with you, just say, yeah, you can stay as long as you want, but I can terminate it at any time.

John Rogers: Very specific.

John Rogers: Be very cutthroat.

Jude Seleck: But shouldn't it be in writing?

John Rogers: Technically, yes. It's an interest in property, so it should be in writing, but that's second semester.

Yessenia Soria: Can you evict them with the courts?

John Rogers: What?

Yessenia Soria: Can you evict them with courts?

Yessenia Soria: You know, file paperwork in the court?

John Rogers: Yeah, I'm sure you could file a lot of stuff in the course. I don't know, that's…

John Rogers: a good research project for you, all I can tell you is it creates a life estate.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: Okay, we're going now into tenancy… at Sufferance?

John Rogers: Otherwise known as, a holdover tenant. Sorry, Evan.

John Rogers: looked at this in a year. A holdover tenant. So you want to look to see.

John Rogers: If a tenant exceeds their term.

John Rogers: Does the tenant exceed their terms? So, if the tenant remains in possession.

John Rogers: Remains on the premise after the lease terminates.

John Rogers: Then they are characterized as a holdover tenant.

John Rogers: So, the landlord has remedies available, which include they can sue for damages that they incurred because they can't rent it out to someone else, they can go through the eviction process, which they file paperwork in the court, or they can simply,

John Rogers: bind… They could, hold the tenant to, a new lease.

doven: I think it's a lease.

John Rogers: Periodic… it would hold them to a periodic tendency.

John Rogers: So it would, like, default, for example, month to month.

Fatima Razavi: Is this under tenancy at Sufference?

John Rogers: A holdover tenant, right?

John Rogers: That's the same thing? Did I say holdover tenant? I said it's tenancy at sufferance slash holdover tenant.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, just, thank you.

John Rogers: Now, This is not really creation, this is kind of the repercussions of what happens after.

John Rogers: So you first have to determine what type of lease, though, okay?

John Rogers: Did I…

John Rogers: I don't know if I taught… Statute of frauds this semester.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: It's in your notes, after tenancy at Selfence.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: It gives a one-year provision and the real property provision, but it's just a couple sentences.

John Rogers: I didn't think I put real property provision in there.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Should we just delete it out of our notes?

John Rogers: No, don't delete it, it's just… the problem is this, I mean, any interest in real property must be in writing, but there are exceptions, but I don't teach the exceptions this semester.

John Rogers: Okay, like, part performance.

John Rogers: or estoppel?

John Rogers: that second semester, so I'm kind of kicking myself that I put that in there.

John Rogers: The one-year provision is the one that is critical for me, because that's what triggers the writing requirement for a term of yours, if it exceeds one year.

John Rogers: I don't like to teach it because, you know, some students are in the middle of

John Rogers: contracts now, and they're trying to figure it out, and they're worried, oh, I don't get it! So I usually save it for more of a second semester,

John Rogers: Issue.

John Rogers: Now, a problem arises if… You rent a new place.

John Rogers: So, let's supposing that you rent a place in Venice Beach.

John Rogers: I like Venice, I don't care what anyone says about it. I dig it!

John Rogers: I like it. I think it's cool.

John Rogers: And I want to rent this little cottage.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: And,

John Rogers: I wanted to rent a little cottage in Venice Beach, okay?

John Rogers: And,

John Rogers: And,

John Rogers: So I signed the lease, yahoo! I'm moving in January 1st, 2026. Woohoo! Got this new place, super happy, life is great!

John Rogers: And I go in, And the prior tenant is still there.

doven: Hmm.

John Rogers: The prior tenant is still there.

John Rogers: The question is… Who has to get the tenant out?

John Rogers: Whose obligation is it to get the tenant out?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Now… The rule that I've provided Was, like, 12 years ago.

John Rogers: And I really haven't updated The information to see if the…

John Rogers: Prevailing view has changed at all.

John Rogers: Where… what is the majority view? Is it the English rule, or is it the American rule?

John Rogers: I still think it's the English rule, but if anyone wants to research it and let me know. I don't think it's in the casebook.

John Rogers: I don't think.

John Rogers: But if anyone wishes to let me know, I'd be very interested in knowing. But I believe the English rule is still the majority rule.

John Rogers: Okay.

doven: Nope.

John Rogers: When, A… When you enter into a lease.

John Rogers: the landlord, under the English rule,

John Rogers: The landlord must provide actual possession?

John Rogers: As well as legal possession.

John Rogers: So that means… Legal possession means that you're not a trespasser, you have

John Rogers: A legal right to be there.

John Rogers: But actual possession means… They also must,

John Rogers: It's incumbent upon them to make sure that you can physically be there with no issue.

John Rogers: So, if there is a prior tenant, for example, Still residing in the cottage… under the English rule.

John Rogers: It's the landlord's duty to get them out.

John Rogers: Not the new tenant.

John Rogers: the American role, which I take the position is still the minority view.

John Rogers: There is no requirement of the landlord to provide actual possession, but only legal possession. So, if you're renting this cottage.

John Rogers: You can legally be there. You're not a trespasser. You sign the lease. You have a legal right to be there. Yahoo.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: But the landlord is not obligated to provide actual possession to you, so if there's a prior tenant there.

John Rogers: It's… the obligation is on the new tenant to evict them.

John Rogers: To get them out.

John Rogers: I still think the English rule is the prevailing view, because I think that, if you're renting a new place and someone's not leaving.

John Rogers: And you signed a lease?

John Rogers: I think that there potentially could be gunshots, knives, baseball bats, or people getting hurt.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: And there's only one person that would be happy in that type of situation. Who usually gets happy in that type of situation, when people get hurt and someone gets arrested?

Amir Akbari: Attorneys.

John Rogers: Well, yeah, I was gonna say me. Me. I'm happy. I get happy because someone gets arrested, so then they need a lawyer, so then they pay me to help them.

Fatima Razavi: and the landlord.

Fatima Razavi: Because then he doesn't have to evict the person.

John Rogers: It could be a she.

Fatima Razavi: Dad.

John Rogers: landlords could be a she, but I don't know, I think you're right. I think you're right, a landlord can only be a he.

Fatima Razavi: It could all be a he.

John Rogers: It can only be a he, yes.

John Rogers: But…

Fatima Razavi: God would be a she.

John Rogers: But as a male, biological, and someone identifies as a male, you identifying the landlord as a he, I'm offended.

John Rogers: I'm offended.

Fatima Razavi: Don't be offended.

John Rogers: I would like to have some more gender equality in these examples here.

John Rogers: Anyways… So the English rule seems to be more prevailing.

John Rogers: because… It's less confrontation between the tenant and the prior tenant.

John Rogers: Oh, there's been no new litigation to challenge that. Thank you.

John Rogers: Question.

doven: So, America, they follow the English rule.

doven: Or do they, or do you…

John Rogers: There's… there's two views. There's the English rule, there's the American rule.

doven: I mean, do most states… this state follow? Which rule does…

John Rogers: the majority view is the English rule.

doven: Oh, okay.

John Rogers: So this issue arises.

John Rogers: When someone's leasing a premises, and they go there, and the prior tenant is still there.

John Rogers: So this brings up the who's, what's, what's,

John Rogers: Whose obligation is it to get them out?

John Rogers: It's best practice to discuss both.

John Rogers: So, the English rule and the American rule, but you're…

John Rogers: conclusion should always be towards the majority, which would be the English rule.

John Rogers: Where do I go from here?

John Rogers: I believe we get into assignments and subleases from here.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: an assignment.

John Rogers: And a sublease.

John Rogers: And I guarantee you that at least half this class.

John Rogers: Doesn't know the difference.

John Rogers: So… This is the most challenging part, I think.

John Rogers: Of this part of the class, and it's not hard, but we are dealing with a word called privity that throws students off.

John Rogers: But don't worry, we will ease into it.

John Rogers: So, this issue arises.

John Rogers: When there is an existing tenant, Let's say term of years.

John Rogers: And they want to transfer the lease.

John Rogers: to someone else.

John Rogers: You see that a lot of the times in, like, college dorms, or, like, off-campus student housing.

John Rogers: So, for example, in college, some students will just be there from, like, September till, like, May, but they'll still be on the hook for the summer.

John Rogers: Because it's a one-year lease. So what they'll do is, is they'll want to transfer part of it, or all of it, who knows, to someone else.

John Rogers: So that someone else can stay there for summer and go to SUMMER SCHOOL!

John Rogers: Man, I can't wait till spring break. God, Spring Break! God, I love Spring Break!

John Rogers: I don't know what spring break is anymore. There is no spring break. There is no spring break. Every day I'm working, and…

John Rogers: Whatever.

John Rogers: Spring Break is more like a young… I mean, you're in college.

John Rogers: Anyways, non-existent.

John Rogers: So, the question is this.

John Rogers: What does the tenant Transfer to the new tenant.

John Rogers: Assignment or a sublease?

John Rogers: and determining.

John Rogers: Whether it's an assignment or a sublease is Significant.

John Rogers: is significant.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: The best way to look at this… Okay.

John Rogers: Is an assignment equals… EVERYTHING.

John Rogers: a sublease.

John Rogers: is… Less. Than. EVERYTHING.

John Rogers: So, an assignment is everything.

John Rogers: A sublease is less than everything.

John Rogers: Okay…

John Rogers: So… For example, let's supposing I have a one-year lease, and I've been in the Venice Beach Cottage.

John Rogers: for… 9 months.

John Rogers: And there's 90 days left.

John Rogers: And I'm transferring the lease.

John Rogers: To another tenant for 89 days.

John Rogers: Is that an assignment or a sublease?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Sublease.

John Rogers: Why?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Because there's less than the whole lease.

John Rogers: Are you sure? I mean, it's so close! It's so close! Like, it's, like, so close.

John Rogers: There's still that one day, so that's less than everything.

John Rogers: It's a sublease.

John Rogers: If I transfer ALL the 90 days.

John Rogers: It's more likely to be an assignment.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: what happens if I transfer it, but I reserve, like.

John Rogers: Part of the closet, because,

John Rogers: I reserved the closet of the cottage For my worm farm.

John Rogers: So… Is that an assignment or a sublease?

Sennett Devermont: A sub-lease.

John Rogers: Because I'm not transferring the entire closet.

John Rogers: I've reserved the closet.

John Rogers: It's less than everything.

John Rogers: The rule that I probably am giving you is the duration of the lease.

John Rogers: That's mostly the… likely the most controlling.

John Rogers: To determine if it is an assignment or a sublease is the duration of the lease.

John Rogers: Now, this is where things get tricky.

John Rogers: If… The party. With the tenant.

John Rogers: transfers the lease.

John Rogers: And they say… It's a sublease.

John Rogers: or they SAY.

John Rogers: It's an assignment.

John Rogers: what they say?

John Rogers: is only controlling under the… minority view.

John Rogers: The majority view… Doesn't look at what they say.

John Rogers: They look at the intent, and surrounding circumstances.

John Rogers: So just because… The tenant transfers it to someone, and says, this is an assignment.

John Rogers: Doesn't mean, in a majority view, that this is, in fact, an assignment.

John Rogers: Just because they say it's a sublease.

John Rogers: Doesn't mean that it actually is a sublease.

John Rogers: The minority view only takes what they say as what it is.

John Rogers: the majority view.

John Rogers: Doesn't look at what they say. Looks at what was their intent, and what were the surrounding circumstances.

John Rogers: Many of you have just learned for the first time what the difference between assignment and a sublease is.

John Rogers: Most of the time, it's just used interchangeably.

John Rogers: But both have significant repercussions.

John Rogers: That's why.

John Rogers: It's… what was the intentions? What's going on here?

John Rogers: So… If.

John Rogers: I'm… renting this Venice Beach cottage.

John Rogers: I love it, it's so wonderful.

John Rogers: And… I get a job.

John Rogers: at, pizza parlor.

John Rogers: In New York, Manhattan.

John Rogers: And it's my dream job.

John Rogers: I'm transferring the lease to you.

John Rogers: Because I'm moving to New York.

John Rogers: Do you think I have the intentions, at some point to come back?

John Rogers: and finish… the lease out in Venice?

Mireya Gonzalez: No.

John Rogers: Probably not.

John Rogers: Okay? So, when determining what that lease transfer is.

John Rogers: My intentions are not to return.

John Rogers: So it's most likely that that transfer was an assignment.

John Rogers: was the entire duration of the Venice Beach

John Rogers: Cottage transferred, that's more of an indication that it's an assignment.

John Rogers: So, many students on final exams fall on their face under this. When they have to identify what is this lease, what is this lease transfer, they don't write enough.

John Rogers: Because there's a lot of facts that evidence it.

John Rogers: But they don't use them.

John Rogers: And I will show you when we go through fact patterns.

John Rogers: Now…

John Rogers: Remember, the transfer of the lease is based on the intent of the parties, majority of you, surrounding circumstances.

John Rogers: The minority view is just… What the parties say.

John Rogers: Be very careful, because sometimes fact patterns will just tell you that John subleased to…

John Rogers: bill, or something like that. You gotta be very careful, because usually, if it's in quotations, that's how you know someone is SAYING it.

John Rogers: Versus the fact pattern just giving it to you foundationally, that that's what, in fact, happened.

John Rogers: Okay? So if it's in quotes, red flags, okay?

John Rogers: That's how you know someone is saying it, and not the fact pattern is just giving it to you as a foundational fact.

John Rogers: Now, in… in a… assignment… Okay?

John Rogers: In an assignment, if… if I assign…

John Rogers: the Venice Beach house to you.

John Rogers: Cottage.

John Rogers: And it's an assignment.

John Rogers: You.

John Rogers: Pay the landlord.

John Rogers: I don't pay the landlord.

John Rogers: You are in… privity… with the landlord.

John Rogers: Because you succeeded to all the interest that I had in the original lease.

John Rogers: Consequently, You can sue the landlord.

John Rogers: And the landlord… Consue. You.

John Rogers: Complaints?

John Rogers: Blah blah blah?

John Rogers: Go to the landlord.

John Rogers: So, when there has been an assignment, Everybody could sue each other.

John Rogers: Okay? Everybody's suing each other. So it's landlord, tenant, And then, assignee.

John Rogers: The original tenant is the assignor, the new tenant is the assignee.

John Rogers: Tenant 2.

John Rogers: Everyone can sue each other when there has been an assignment.

John Rogers: The original tenant, me, If I move to New York, yahoo, I'm eating pizza. I can be sued.

John Rogers: Because… I could be sued by the landlord. So if you stop paying rent, I can be sued.

John Rogers: Because I'm still under privity of contract.

John Rogers: with the landlord.

John Rogers: So, landlords actually favor assignments.

John Rogers: Because they have two people on the hook.

John Rogers: They can go after 2 people.

John Rogers: So landlords actually favor assignments.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You can get released, though, right?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: as a…

John Rogers: It's like you assign it after they explicitly release you? Yes, there are instances. I don't think I've ever tested on this. It's more of a contract principle. There is a concept called a novation.

John Rogers: a Novation. It, it used to be tested by my former counterpart, Michelle Tobankin.

John Rogers: Find her on social media. Follow her, she's really sweet.

John Rogers: she…

John Rogers: It's called a novation, which is a third-party contract, which basically says, you can no longer sue me, I'm out.

John Rogers: It's a contract to get out of a contract, okay? It's called a novation, is what it is. And you should be learning it, or you will learn it, in contracts.

John Rogers: Okay.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I asked because it recently happened to me, and they wouldn't let me out unless I paid them. They wanted money to let me off the hook.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Oh.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: It's kind of interesting.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Now… for a… Dub. Lista.

John Rogers: Sublease.

John Rogers: sublease is less than everything, so if I'm moving to Venice Beach, or if I'm still in Venice Beach, and, you know, I kind of want to just, like, kind of like, my girlfriend lives in Malibu, and she's got a really cool house in Malibu, and I kind of want to stay with her more, because she's got a really cool view of the beach, and maybe she's got a couple of butlers, who knows?

John Rogers: So, I want to stay there, but I want to kind of keep the Venice Beach place, because it's still pretty cool.

John Rogers: I might want to sublease the place.

John Rogers: Which means I may have intentions of coming back. I'm… they're still available there.

John Rogers: If there is a sublease, And I sublease it to you.

John Rogers: And now you're in the Venice Beach Cottage.

John Rogers: And you stop paying rent?

John Rogers: That means you're not paying me.

John Rogers: In a sublease.

John Rogers: You don't pay the landlord.

John Rogers: I still pay the landlord.

John Rogers: So you pay me, Then I pay the landlord.

John Rogers: If you want to sue someone, you sue me.

John Rogers: If the landlord wants to sue someone, the landlord sues me.

John Rogers: You and the landlord.

John Rogers: Cannot sue each other.

John Rogers: Because there's no privity.

John Rogers: You, as a sub-lessee, Did not succeed to all of my interest.

John Rogers: It's… Less than my interest.

John Rogers: So it's not everything.

John Rogers: So there's no privy with you.

John Rogers: And the landlord.

John Rogers: So if there's any grievances, No hot water!

John Rogers: You bring it to my attention.

John Rogers: Not the landlord.

John Rogers: So, in essence, I'm like your landlord.

John Rogers: Make sense so far?

John Rogers: So sometimes the fact pattern, one of the questions might say, like, what are, you know,

John Rogers: Shelly's rights against Tom. Tom's, against,

John Rogers: Larry, the landlord, and Shelly's the subway.

John Rogers: And it'll be a full call to that question 3. 0, none. It's a sublease.

John Rogers: That's it?

John Rogers: Subways. There's no rights, there's no privy, so they can't sue each other.

John Rogers: Yes, sublessor, sablesee, correct.

John Rogers: Man, where was I going?

John Rogers: Forgot what I was gonna say, what was I gonna say?

John Rogers: We got sublist, a sublet, a sub…

doven: A question… just one question, easy. So, if a sign… assignee don't… No.

doven: The signing… they pay the landlord, so they can sue the landlord. They can sue each other.

doven: Everybody can sue each other, the tenant, landlord, someone assigning.

doven: And… Something lesser don't have to deal with the landlord, they just deal with the tenant.

John Rogers: I… what I'm gonna say is this, assignment? Everyone's getting sued.

John Rogers: Everyone can sue each other.

John Rogers: a sublease.

John Rogers: It's just the middle person, the original tenant. So, landlord has to go to the original tenant, the original tenant has to go to the new tenant, the sub lessee.

doven: And vice versa.

John Rogers: Go like that. In assignment, it's just a triangle, everyone's going after each other.

doven: Okay, so if a signee don't pay, the landlord, the landlord can sue the signee and the tenant.

John Rogers: An assignment, everyone's suing each other.

doven: Thank you.

Amir Akbari: I have a question for the case that you said you moved to the New York. If you keep just the closet over there, what happened in the majority view? Because you sub-leasing, right?

Amir Akbari: Are they going to see your intent and the surrounding circumstances, or…

John Rogers: So, really, what is it?

Amir Akbari: What was the intentions?

John Rogers: if I'm reserving something, maybe I don't have the intentions of relinquishing all interest, because maybe I do have intentions of coming back at some point.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, because I don't see… I'm confused with saying that it's less than everything, right? Here, we can say it's less than everything.

Amir Akbari: But at the other side, they look at the intent and the surrounding circumstances that you don't want to come back.

John Rogers: I mean, the intentions?

John Rogers: I don't know, we'll go over a couple cases on it.

Mireya Gonzalez: Is there ever… What would happen if the landlord Doesn't allow a sublease.

John Rogers: Yep.

John Rogers: Happens.

John Rogers: Not all landlords are cool, right?

John Rogers: There are, and this is tested, No transfer clauses in leases.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Also known as restraint.

John Rogers: clauses.

John Rogers: And they are always strictly construed in favor of… the tenant.

John Rogers: So, there could be a provision.

John Rogers: that says… Tenant cannot sublease.

John Rogers: the premises.

John Rogers: Period.

John Rogers: But that's construed, because it doesn't say that the tenant can't a sign.

John Rogers: If the provision says, tenant cannot assign the lease.

John Rogers: Well, it could be construed, because now the tenant can Sublease.

John Rogers: So… This is how I get cute.

John Rogers: Get real cute on a final.

John Rogers: There's landlord and tenant.

John Rogers: one-year lease.

John Rogers: the tenant asks the landlord, hey, I wanna…

John Rogers: They enter into a lease, and it says… and there's a provision that says, no subleasing.

Mireya Gonzalez: So then the tenant goes to the landlord after about 6 months.

John Rogers: It says, hey, I wanna, go to New York to eat pizza.

John Rogers: You mind if I sublease this,

John Rogers: this cottage to… to Jane Doe.

John Rogers: Landlord says no.

John Rogers: And I say, you know what?

John Rogers: I think you're… I think you're being reasonable.

John Rogers: So I go to Jane Doe, and I say, Jane, I am subleasing the remainder of my lease to you.

John Rogers: some students… will…

John Rogers: want to put a shotgun to the tenant's head and bury this person in the desert about 300 yards off the 10 freeway, just shy of…

John Rogers: Palm Springs. No one will ever find the body.

John Rogers: In essence, that's awful, that's terrible, the tenant should be shot and should be dead for doing that.

John Rogers: But what did I tell you?

John Rogers: Don't con… it's not controlling what the tenant says… So even though I SAID… It's a sublease. It's actually…

John Rogers: An assignment… So that…

doven: Can you repeat that again?

John Rogers: Oh, man, I don't know where to be kidding!

John Rogers: Oh, man.

John Rogers: I don't even know where to begin.

John Rogers: Let me just finish what I was saying.

John Rogers: But,

John Rogers: So… Just because there's a no transfer clause that says no sublease doesn't necessarily mean

John Rogers: That the tenant did, in fact, sublease.

John Rogers: They may have committed an assignment.

John Rogers: So, anyways, I will answer your question through some of the essays, because we'll get to those, but the best way, what I usually like to drop hints, and I've only deviated one year before… one year, but generally, I throw you a bone

John Rogers: And if the secondary tenant If their name begins with S, Shelly… Sam.

John Rogers: Sarah?

John Rogers: They're a sub lessee.

John Rogers: If they're Al… Alex…

John Rogers: Ashley… Ash… Short names.

John Rogers: It's an assignment.

John Rogers: So… Tom, the tenant, Subleased the remainder of his lease to… Ashley.

John Rogers: Question.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah, Professor, two quick questions. In that situation where the landlord doesn't allow a sublease and the tenant does it anyways, does that give rise to adverse possession?

John Rogers: No.

gevorg kulikyan: That's not trespassing on the subleasing.

John Rogers: Don't, don't mention adverse possession.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay. And then, when you said the subleaseee doesn't have any rights.

gevorg kulikyan: Do they still have rights towards the sub-lesser?

John Rogers: Yes, oh, absolutely. They just can't go after the landlord.

gevorg kulikyan: Yeah.

gevorg kulikyan: Cool.

John Rogers: Questions? Anything else?

Mireya Gonzalez: I do. Say… someone… A gives B a sublease.

Mireya Gonzalez: To potentially make profit.

Mireya Gonzalez: Does that pose any problem when you make profit of the sublease?

John Rogers: I have a friend.

John Rogers: Long before Airbnb.

John Rogers: Son of a bitch.

John Rogers: Claims he worked so hard.

John Rogers: But he doesn't.

John Rogers: And he would rent out mansions in Malibu.

John Rogers: Hollywood Hills, Manhattan Beach, Laguna Beach, Month to month.

John Rogers: Or you'd have, like, a year lease or something, month to month or something like that. And he would sublease out these mansions for weekends. So if his…

John Rogers: monthly rent is, like, \$20,000, \$25,000. He'll charge, like, \$10,000, \$15,000 a weekend so people can have a big party.

John Rogers: He just profits.

John Rogers: But he works so hard. Like, I work really hard. No, he doesn't.

John Rogers: Didn't own anything.

John Rogers: Like, he's been doing that for, like, no kidding, like, a long frickin' time.

doven: Is he loaded?

John Rogers: 2008… 2008, he started doing that.

John Rogers: Is he loaded?

John Rogers: Yeah, he's got a lot of money. He's got a lot of money.

John Rogers: Got a lot of money.

Mireya Gonzalez: Now, what if there is, a no transfer cause? Like, what if there is

Mireya Gonzalez: Where you cannot sublease, but they still are subleasing it to make profit.

John Rogers: It would…

Mireya Gonzalez: You said then it would be an assignment?

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: I said, if they… if it says no sublease, and the person does, in fact, sublease, it would be a breach of the lease.

John Rogers: But it doesn't mean… just be very careful, because if the person says it's a sublease.

John Rogers: Don't automatically assume it's a breach of the lease, because it may actually be an assignment.

Mireya Gonzalez: Thank you.

Sennett Devermont: What happens if it's less than everything, but the, but the person's paying the landlord directly?

Sennett Devermont: Or is that…

John Rogers: You know what?

John Rogers: That's… Make the best argument you can, perhaps for an assignment.

Sennett Devermont: Right, because I think if you're paying the landlord, that's what ties the liability stuff, to some degree.

John Rogers: That is actually a factor to consider.

John Rogers: Big time.

John Rogers: Big time.

John Rogers: That I wasn't gonna say anything until we got to an essay, but yes, you caught it.

John Rogers: Actually, it's a case. We're actually gonna be a, we'll have a case on it.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: Assignments, Some leases.

Mireya Gonzalez: Sorry, one more. You mentioned for subleases that there's restraints.

Mireya Gonzalez: As far as for assignments, do we have restraints for that as well, or some form of restraint for assignments?

John Rogers: It's just a restraint clause that says you cannot assign, or you cannot sublease, or you cannot assign or sublease.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Now, I believe I threw in my notes, and I'm gonna conclude here before we take a break.

John Rogers: that there is a concept, and tell me if it's not in there, called the Rule in Dump Hours case.

Mireya Gonzalez: It's here.

Karen Hernandez: It's there.

John Rogers: And that was on the bar exam. Couldn't believe it.

John Rogers: It was a multiple-choice question. Couldn't believe it!

John Rogers: Wild.

John Rogers: That, in essence, if there is a no transfer clause, you can't transfer this, you can't sublease or assignment.

John Rogers: And if the landlord permits that transfer.

John Rogers: Okay, for example, if the landlord were to agree for you to assign the lease.

John Rogers: The landlord can't object.

John Rogers: To any additional assignments in the future.

John Rogers: Unless they,

John Rogers: expressly reserve the ability to do that. So, for example, if I assign the lease to you.

John Rogers: And then you assign it to someone else.

John Rogers: If the landlord Has a no transfer clause.

John Rogers: precluding assignments, and I assign it to you, and the landlord was okay with that, the landlord waives the ability to object to any future assignments to anyone else.

John Rogers: Unless they specifically, Expressly reserve the right to object to any future.

John Rogers: assignments. Make sense?

John Rogers: Let's take a break.

Yessenia Soria: Any minutes is the break, Professor?

John Rogers: 15. I've gotta give you 15.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: Alright, does anyone have any questions?

Fatima Razavi: I do, it's just a random question. What happens when you wanna…

Fatima Razavi: the price of the lease or stuff. At what point do you do that when you have

Fatima Razavi: The one that's indefinite, forgot the name of it.

John Rogers: At will.

Fatima Razavi: Yes, at will.

John Rogers: So I want to… Increase the rent.

Fatima Razavi: Can you, at that point?

John Rogers: Terminated at will.

Fatima Razavi: Okay, but at any point, you can increase it.

John Rogers: Huh?

Fatima Razavi: Okay.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

John Rogers: Not as bad as… Present and future interest, right?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): No, thankfully.

John Rogers: Not as bad, right?

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: And you're not as scared, right?

doven: Me knows a fee simple, that's all.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Well, I, don't have a lot of… I was hoping to have more friends by now, but, realized I don't really have too many friends, as much as I…

John Rogers: thought I would have.

John Rogers: So… but usually around finals time, I get a lot of friends.

John Rogers: So please, if you want to be friends, let's be friends sooner than later, okay?

Yessenia Soria: Professor.

Yessenia Soria: So, I want to be your friend. Can I send you an essay?

Yessenia Soria: And you could review it, or no?

John Rogers: I'm getting caught up with essays…

John Rogers: probably this Sunday.

John Rogers: So, yeah.

Yessenia Soria: I'm gonna be honest with you, I was kind of scared to do an essay.

Yessenia Soria: But as of today, when I took your little test, I did pretty good, so I'm kind of happy about that.

John Rogers: Book my little test. I don't know what test you're referring to.

Yessenia Soria: The assessment…

John Rogers: I never administered anything. I don't even know what was given to you. I didn't even know about this. This is not my little test, okay? But I'm glad they gave you that confidence boost.

Yessenia Soria: A little bit, because there was, like, one question that was, like, iffy about it, but…

Yessenia Soria: I literally guessed it, and I got it correct, so I think I'm not that stupid in this class.

John Rogers: Cheers to this.

Yessenia Soria: I know, so I feel a little bit more confident, so… I was scared to do your essays, but I have, like, two going on, but…

Yessenia Soria: I'm gonna try to get in by Sunday, for sure.

doven: I would like to send you an essay, you know, do the best I can, but I'm scared for that fee simple.

John Rogers: Okie dokie. Well, I'll make you unscared, so just give me a call and I'll make you unscared.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Try to make you unscared.

John Rogers: Any questions about what we've covered so far?

Yessenia Soria: You know what? There was a question on the… on the quiz.

John Rogers: Hmm.

Yessenia Soria: that, it was a brother and sister that I know. I just want to know the answer.

John Rogers: w-we'.

Yessenia Soria: Oh, the brother?

John Rogers: Apple class. Maybe you could email it to me or something.

Yessenia Soria: Okay, I'll email it to you then.

Yessenia Soria: Okay.

Yessenia Soria: Well, it has to do with landlords, that's why, but okay.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: I'm gonna do this the old-fashioned way, and I'm gonna show you guys a piece of paper.

John Rogers: Who still uses paper?

John Rogers: So… Let's say landlord?

John Rogers: Intent, okay?

John Rogers: Can I slow down?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): No, that's good pace.

John Rogers: So then it's… an assignment to… Assignee 1.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Then it's an assignment to… Assignee 2… And then, an assignment to… 3.

John Rogers: There we go.

John Rogers: So, landlord leases to tenant, tenant assigns to A1, A1 assigns to A2, and A2 assigns to A3.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Make sure you understand this, because in this situation, okay, the only people in this situation that can be sued

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: is A3.

John Rogers: landlord.

John Rogers: And the tenant.

John Rogers: A1 and A2?

John Rogers: cannot be sued. They're gone. They're goodbye.

John Rogers: They're enjoying sushi in Tokyo.

doven: Oh, they can't be sued.

John Rogers: Dude, it's only a… It's only A3, and the landlord, and the tenant, okay?

doven: Okay.

John Rogers: The last one standing can be sued.

John Rogers: So, A3 can sue tenant.

John Rogers: Tenant can sue landlord, landlord A3, but A1, A2 can't be sued. They're gone. There's no privy that exists there, okay?

John Rogers: There is an exception, okay?

John Rogers: If you see…

John Rogers: That.

John Rogers: Either?

John Rogers: or both.

John Rogers: A2… an A1.

John Rogers: assumed the obligations.

John Rogers: to the lease.

John Rogers: If you see the Word, assumed.

John Rogers: or… personal liability.

John Rogers: That puts them on the hook.

John Rogers: So… If I change A1 to use, like, assumed the lease obligations.

John Rogers: assume the lease obligations here. So, in this situation.

John Rogers: if A1 assumed the lease obligations, okay?

John Rogers: And that is there, you can see it.

John Rogers: then that means the landlord can sue T, A1, AND.

John Rogers: A3.

John Rogers: But not A2.

John Rogers: So, if you see this, Here.

John Rogers: That is making them liable. They are expressly saying that I will assume the obligations to the lease.

John Rogers: So… Landlords generally don't, oppose that, because, it's another person on the hook.

John Rogers: So they can always collect from multiple people.

John Rogers: And, sometimes landlords might not agree to an assignment, for example, but they will if they say, if you assume obligations, yes, I will. I will allow the assignment. Okay.

John Rogers: So that puts them on the hook.

John Rogers: So remember…

John Rogers: Okay? Because this was on, I can remember, as a question on the bar exam, on a multiple choice. Subed.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: We're gonna know a little bit more about that word next semester as well.

John Rogers: Assuming.

John Rogers: Assuming, yeah, assuming it's subject to a mortgage. Yeah, we'll learn about it next semester. So if you make the mistake of taking me next semester.

John Rogers: There you go.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Professor, can I ask you a question?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Who… I'm sorry, this might be a dumb question, but who's A1 and A2 and A3?

John Rogers: The assignee 1, Assignee 2, and Assignee 3.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Okay. Thank you.

John Rogers: Judge Veristigi, go ahead.

Mireya Gonzalez: I'm not understanding when you said that when A1 gets pulled in.

Mireya Gonzalez: If they assume the obligations to the lease. Can you explain that one more time?

John Rogers: Sure.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: Stop.

John Rogers: Landlord-tenant. So, landlord and tenant enter into a lease agreement.

John Rogers: Tenant then assigns to A1.

John Rogers: Ashley.

John Rogers: And this is Al, and this is… Alex.

John Rogers: So… Tenant assigns the entire lease.

John Rogers: to A1, the assignee 1, or Tenant 2, whatever you want.

John Rogers: then this tenant assigns everything to A2. Then this person assigns everything to A3.

John Rogers: If there was no assumption here, A3, the original tenant, and the landlord all sue each other.

John Rogers: The only way that you could crack the people within this chain

John Rogers: Is if one of them, the individuals that assumed the lease obligations, because that made them personally liable.

John Rogers: So that's the way that the landlord can sue them.

John Rogers: If it's a sublease, someone wrote, it's not applicable to subleases because there's no privy anywhere.

John Rogers: It's only assignments.

John Rogers: You've been talking about Judge Baristigi, and I want to show you a picture of her.

John Rogers: I have to host an event, and she's gonna be speaking, so I'll show you the flyer, so everyone can see what I'm talking about, those glasses, here it is.

John Rogers: She's right there.

John Rogers: See? Can y'all see that?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Oh, wow, you're right. Wow.

John Rogers: B?

John Rogers: Told you guys. I told you guys. I told you guys!

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Amazing!

John Rogers: It was crazy.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Easy.

John Rogers: So, questions on the assignments?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Can there be a sublease to a sublease?

John Rogers: Sure.

John Rogers: Rare, very rare to see that, but…

John Rogers: I'm gonna be subleasing what… yeah, sure. It's less than… yes, you can. Yes, you can.

John Rogers: Don't often see that, though.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: You guys are smart.

John Rogers: No questions, wow.

John Rogers: I gotta tell the dean.

John Rogers: I'm gonna text Dean Frickberg and just let him know I got… Absolute.

John Rogers: a genius group.

John Rogers: Real hot shots.

John Rogers: Remember, if you're in contracts, and you're going to reviews with Dean Frickberg, you can always ask him property questions.

John Rogers: Should do that.

John Rogers: That is critical. So, identify what is the transfer, What are the repercussions?

John Rogers: Okay? Who can sue who? Because someone's not gonna pay rent.

John Rogers: Someone's not paying, so who can the landlord go after, okay?

John Rogers: And I talked about the rule in Dumport's case before break.

John Rogers: going pretty quick, because I typically… from where we're at right now, usually is one entire class, but we've gone pretty quick, so…

John Rogers: We've gone pretty quick.

John Rogers: this is where… I'm not sure what happens next.

John Rogers: lease termination?

John Rogers: Is it lease termination?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Landlord's Remedies?

John Rogers: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: Landlord's remedies. So what happens is what you need to know is this.

John Rogers: And we will have a case on this.

John Rogers: What can the landlord do?

John Rogers: If you stop paying rent, Landlord.

John Rogers: I… I just want to live in this mansion, but I don't want to have to pay you rent.

John Rogers: What can the landlord do?

John Rogers: That's the question. What remedy?

John Rogers: So… Could the landlord use… Self-help.

John Rogers: remedies.

John Rogers: Me.

John Rogers: Can the landlord… physically, oust you.

John Rogers: From the house.

John Rogers: Well… The rationale for, no, they can't resort to self-help remedies, they must always use the judicial process.

John Rogers: Remember, landlords hate it, because…

John Rogers: You'd be just living in the house, rent-free, and they'd have to litigate their case for months, if not a year.

John Rogers: I lose out on all that money.

John Rogers: So they must always resort to the judicial process. Always. There's no excuse. Well, maybe there's an exception. Maybe, like, maybe there's, like, this one thing in… no.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: So, here's the rationale.

John Rogers: If a landlord Was able to use self-help remedies, remedy, and physically ousth you.

John Rogers: So, if John Rogers is the tenant.

John Rogers: The landlord says, hey John, I'm gonna grab you by the shirt, and the pants, and throw you out of the house.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: Am I just supposed to get thrown out, or will I potentially become defensive?

John Rogers: That is hysterical, what someone just wrote me.

John Rogers: That is hysterical.

John Rogers: Oh, that is good. That is so funny.

John Rogers: Can I say it out loud?

Mireya Gonzalez: Now you kinda have to.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: If American or English rules don't work, use the Armenian rule. Cut the water and power and gas, they'll get the F out.

John Rogers: I like that, that's funny.

doven: Well, that's what some landlords I heard do. If they have trouble getting tenants out, they cut the lights out.

John Rogers: Yeah. But what you need to know is that,

John Rogers: You must always resort to the judicial process. Go to the court, go to the judge.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: If the landlord was permitted to use self-help, meaning physically oust someone, there would be then confrontation, and potentially

John Rogers: Violence.

John Rogers: And there's only a few people that would be happy if there's violence.

Alice Orozco: So here's you.

John Rogers: Yes, that's correct.

John Rogers: Yes. 1250 IQ you have. Me. I would be happy, because someone gets arrested. Would the police be happy?

Sennett Devermont: Unfortunately.

John Rogers: Yes, they would be happy! They arrest someone! They have job security! Oh, we wish to have a world with no crime. That means you have no job.

John Rogers: Prosecutors! Yes, they want crime! I want to live in a world with no crime. They want crime because otherwise they don't have a job. Judge.

John Rogers: Criminal judge. They need crime!

John Rogers: So, hey!

John Rogers: And the defense attorneys. Court staff! They all need grind. So cheers next time you're at a bar!

John Rogers: Cheers to crime.

John Rogers: So, the landlord's remedies always resort to the judicial process, not self-help.

John Rogers: Then there are ways to… Terminate the lease.

John Rogers: How do I get out of it?

John Rogers: How do we get out of this?

John Rogers: So what happens if you're in a relationship with someone?

John Rogers: You guys signed a lease together!

John Rogers: And all of a sudden, you…

John Rogers: bad blood ensues, and you guys break up, what do you do? It's kind of a little awkward, like, what do you do, you know? Like…

John Rogers: How do you break the lease?

John Rogers: I'm not with her anymore, I need to get off the lease. Well, I don't care, you should have thought of that.

John Rogers: We signed it.

John Rogers: How do you break it?

John Rogers: For one, you're gonna have to really suck up to the landlord, if they even agree to it.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: One method, though, is a… Surrender.

John Rogers: I am surrendering the lease, okay? I am surrendering, okay? It is an offer made by the tenant

John Rogers: But to terminate the lease, but the landlord must accept it.

John Rogers: Meaning…

John Rogers: In order for there to be a termination, it is subject to the landlord accepting it. The landlord does not have to accept it.

John Rogers: And if the landlord accepts the offer to surrender,

John Rogers: it extinguishes all obligations to the lease moving forward. So, the, tenant is no longer

John Rogers: Obliga- has any obligations to the lease?

John Rogers: Now, things can get kind of tricky, because, for example, let's suppose you have a 3-year lease.

John Rogers: And then after 1 year, you want to terminate, so you want to terminate that 2 years. Some jurisdictions, I…

John Rogers: I don't know if it's minority or majority, I er… I don't know.

John Rogers: May require that to be in writing. Oftentimes, it always is in writing, but, especially if it's over that two-year period, because you're asking to terminate a contract over 1 year.

John Rogers: I don't really test on that, so, but just for note-taking purposes.

John Rogers: So, this does come up. You want to look for facts on a fact pattern, on an essay, where someone is writing to the landlord and maybe tendering the key and last month's rent.

John Rogers: Okay, that is an offer to surrender the lease. If the landlord accepts that, which the landlord doesn't have to.

John Rogers: Then that terminates the lease and extinguishes the tenant's further obligations of a lease.

John Rogers: If the landlord says no, which the landlord absolutely can.

John Rogers: Then, the tenant is still on the hook.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: If… The landlord, for example, does not agree to the surrender.

John Rogers: Or maybe the tenant just says, I'm just bouncing out. I'm… I'm…

John Rogers: I kinda just wanna go live in Bucharest, Romania.

John Rogers: I want to live in Bucharest, Romania.

John Rogers: It takes off.

John Rogers: The tenant, then.

John Rogers: Abandoned.

John Rogers: the lease.

John Rogers: an abandonment.

John Rogers: It's not a way to… Is not…

John Rogers: A way to terminate the lease.

John Rogers: But it is a way that a landlord can collect rent.

John Rogers: Now, the rule statement that you have been provided Will contain the words.

John Rogers: WITHOUT Justification.

John Rogers: Without justification is in that rule.

John Rogers: Because…

John Rogers: If someone is not paying rent and they leave, the landlord's gonna say, you're abandoning the premise, I want my money. I'm gonna sue you.

John Rogers: But… The tenant may be justified in leaving.

doven: Maybe the landlord didn't correct all the issues, or there's a habitability issue.

John Rogers: So the tenant is justified in leaving.

John Rogers: Yes, question.

doven: You said that, first of all, so they abandon the, the tenant abandons the property when they take off.

doven: So they may be justified if the landlord doesn't do some things.

John Rogers: Well, for example, if, if you're renting… An apartment.

John Rogers: and there's no running hot water. Oh, God! And there's no electricity, and the gas is off.

John Rogers: And I'm saying, sorry, you know, I'm traveling, so, you know, I'll deal with it in, like, 90 days when I come back.

John Rogers: You might just want to leave, because this is not fit for ordinary, reasonable use.

John Rogers: I don't want to live a life in candlelight and cold water.

John Rogers: So, the landlord is going to treat you as abandoning.

John Rogers: Because you have no intentions of returning.

John Rogers: But you are gonna fire back and say, I was justified.

John Rogers: Based on the landlord's omissions in not correcting, problems and habitability issues with this lease, with this premises.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Makes sense.

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: There might be instances now.

John Rogers: abandonment, then mitigation. Let's suppose it.

John Rogers: You're my tenant.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: I like you so much.

John Rogers: I am leasing to you a home. And where's the home?

John Rogers: Anywhere.

John Rogers: Sure.

John Rogers: Oh, yeah, that's a good spot.

doven: I did about, bro.

John Rogers: Loya just won't first, but yeah, Santa Barbara school, too. I'll take it. I'll take either.

John Rogers: So, I am leasing to you my La Jolla home.

John Rogers: And… For one year.

John Rogers: After a month, you say, you know, I don't really like La Jolla, it's too, like…

John Rogers: Run down and icky.

John Rogers: You know?

John Rogers: Loya's really run down and icky.

John Rogers: So you moved to,

John Rogers: Miami. After a month. You say, John, I'm not paying anymore, This place is terrible.

John Rogers: I'm outta here.

John Rogers: And you abandon it. You take off.

John Rogers: You stop paying me.

John Rogers: Do I, as the landlord, Have an obligation.

John Rogers: To lessen the blow.

John Rogers: Hmm.

John Rogers: Can I just sit back and say, Yeah…

John Rogers: And just do nothing for 11 months.

John Rogers: And then sue you for 11 months of back rent.

John Rogers: Well, the answer is… it.

John Rogers: Depends.

John Rogers: It depends what jurisdiction you're in. Minority?

John Rogers: Or a majority.

John Rogers: The minority view Says that you don't have to…

John Rogers: You know, I'm leasing to you.

John Rogers: the majority of you is I don't have to do anything. I could just sit back on the couch and watch TV for 11 months and do nothing, and then go after you for 11 months of rent.

John Rogers: The majority view.

John Rogers: Imposes a requirement, an obligation.

John Rogers: on the landlord.

John Rogers: to try to… mitigate.

John Rogers: their loss.

John Rogers: Meaning?

John Rogers: I can't sit back for 11 months and do nothing.

John Rogers: If… I actually have to use reasonable efforts

John Rogers: To try to find a new replacing tenant.

John Rogers: If I use those reasonable efforts.

John Rogers: And I still can't find someone.

John Rogers: then yeah, I can go after you for that 11 months.

John Rogers: If I use reasonable efforts, and

John Rogers: I'm able to find a tenant after 5 months, then I can only go after you.

John Rogers: 4 or 5 months, until I found that replacing tenant.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: It's called duty to mitigate. So, the landlord is under an obligation to mitigate their loss as much as possible.

John Rogers: This issue is tested all the time. Almost every single year.

John Rogers: the landlord's obligation. So anytime the landlord is suing someone for money, you always have to look to see, did the landlord mitigate

John Rogers: If they didn't mitigate, the majority of you is, can't collect, sorry, you take the loss.

John Rogers: landlord.

John Rogers: If the landlord does mitigate, Then they can collect for the months they couldn't re-let the premises.

John Rogers: Because they're oper… they're… they're, they're… they're… they're acting in good faith.

John Rogers: It's kind of like contracts. In fact, this IS a contracts concept.

John Rogers: And I hate C… Oh.

John Rogers: Classes.

John Rogers: So the class begins with a C.

John Rogers: Oh.

John Rogers: I don't like it.

John Rogers: So unfortunately, this is a contracts principle that you will learn in Contracts 2, if I'm not mistaken.

John Rogers: And it requires that upon, like, a breach of some sort, the…

John Rogers: Party that's not in breach has to mitigate the loss as much as possible.

John Rogers: So, since a lease agreement is a contract.

John Rogers: The landlord has to use reasonable efforts To locate a new tenant.

John Rogers: So much that if the landlord doesn't, the tenant in court can say, hey, you didn't do anything, so you can't collect anything, because you did nothing.

John Rogers: You didn't do anything.

John Rogers: Make sense?

John Rogers: So look to see if the landlord did any reasonable efforts whatsoever.

John Rogers: This issue could be a major issue, or a minor issue.

John Rogers: But it's always… an issue.

doven: The minority view, they can do nothing, wait 11 months, and then sue, but the majority view, duty to mitigate.

John Rogers: Yes! So, the landlord and the minority of you can just sit on their couch and eat Lay's potato chips, and do nothing for 11 months, and collect.

Mireya Gonzalez: Do we discuss both the minority and the majority view?

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: But you don't have to get too much in detail for the minority. Just simply quoting the minority for one sentence, it will suffice. You don't have to go into it.

John Rogers: The only time that I think that you should really give me a discussion about minority is when it's dealing with

John Rogers: Lean theory versus title theory, and maybe English rule versus American. That's it.

John Rogers: Everything else, just one sentence on the minority is fine.

Yessenia Soria: Professor, can you repeat the other one? It's lien theory versus title. What's the second one?

John Rogers: American Rule versus English rule.

John Rogers: Questions so far?

John Rogers: Am I teaching this perfectly, or do you guys need any, have questions?

Sennett Devermont: I had a question in surrender, in your notes, it says, if the landlord accepts the tenant's offer to surrender, then the lease is terminated and future rent is due.

John Rogers: Future rent is due?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I had a question on Dido.

John Rogers: Yeah, that's a… that's gotta be a typo. It's gotta be not due.

Sennett Devermont: not do.

John Rogers: Yeah, because it extinguishes any further obligation.

John Rogers: Terminates the lease.

John Rogers: That's a typo.

John Rogers: See, I told you guys, I mean, I do make mistakes sometimes, so go buy a lottery ticket, because, I mean, it only happens once every century!

John Rogers: Jeez.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: They could still go after accrued rent, though, like, stuff they hadn't paid in that time, right?

John Rogers: Yes, absolutely, yes.

John Rogers: Correct.

John Rogers: Absolutely correct.

doven: So they can go after what they haven't paid, as opposed to mitigate for what they…

doven: Are old in the future.

John Rogers: Look, here's the thing. If the landlord accepts the… Surrender.

John Rogers: from that moment forward, they… the lease extinguishes, so any future rent payments, gone. No obligation to do that. But any backdue.

John Rogers: is still owed.

doven: Thank you.

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, for abandonment?

gevorg kulikyan: when the…

gevorg kulikyan: When the tenant has justification, do they have to give the landlord, like, a reasonable time to correct the issue?

John Rogers: We're gonna get into that in just a second.

gevorg kulikyan: Oh, capable.

gevorg kulikyan: Thank you.

John Rogers: I did get a question from a majority of my… a minority. I answered that. Do you still want me to answer that?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Sorry, for which definition was it that not owed? I'm a little lost.

John Rogers: Oh, man, surrender?

Sennett Devermont: It was the second-to-last sentence in surrender.

John Rogers: That is evidence that I'm not perfect, okay? That is evidence that I'm not perfect.

John Rogers: But you know who's perfect? You all. I think you all are perfect. You're perfect in every way.

Amir Akbari: Did we discuss the tenant who defaults?

Amir Akbari: Because there is on the note.

John Rogers: A tenant who… so, a tenant who stops paying rent?

John Rogers: Where are you seeing that?

Amir Akbari: On the note before the… Remedies.

Amir Akbari: There's a bear Gambita case. Take the security deposit.

John Rogers: Sue for damages, move for eviction.

Amir Akbari: I think it's before that.

Amir Akbari: B for the remedies.

John Rogers: Well, do you have a question about something in regard.

Amir Akbari: I wanna know if we covered it, or no.

John Rogers: I don't… I don't know.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: No worries, he's saying that, yeah, if the tenant defaults.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Then the landlord has those remedies that we talked about, right?

John Rogers: Yeah.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Surrender… abandonment, right? Am I wrong about that?

John Rogers: A tenant who defaults, meaning I stopped paying rent.

John Rogers: They… if they're still there, what are the remedies of the.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I've worked, yeah.

John Rogers: So, I'm not sure… I mean, what is written there? Can someone just read it to me?

Karen Hernandez: Yeah, it says, if tenant defaults, self-help for landlord, and it says Berg v. Wiley.

John Rogers: Yeah. Okay, didn't I just talk about that? Like, self-help, you must use the judicial process. I talked about that, did I not?

Amir Akbari: Yes.

Amir Akbari: Yes.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: On the self-help, that's only, modern, right? If it… if the question calls for… use common law, you would not use… you could use self-help.

John Rogers: Well… Yeah. Heh. Get Oot.

John Rogers: The olden days, in 18… 05.

John Rogers: Get out.

John Rogers: Take a shotgun, get out.

John Rogers: Solved a lot of problems.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: I still think this class is harder than evidence.

John Rogers: We are now moving into… we're going fast! Oh, man, I've never gone this fast before.

John Rogers: We are now going into… quiet enjoyment.

John Rogers: very… Very commonly tested. Guaranteed to be on your final. Guaranteed. Guaranteed.

John Rogers: Guaranteed, and I will twist your brain up, okay?

John Rogers: The landlord has duties, obligations. The tenant has obligations. The tenant must pay rent.

John Rogers: There's a covenant to do that, but… the landlord… has an obligation to provide

John Rogers: Reasonable enjoyment to the premises, to ensure that there is… Quiet enjoyment.

John Rogers: to the tenant.

John Rogers: There's 3 types of eviction.

John Rogers: There's actual, partial, which I don't actually think is in my notes anymore, I'm not sure. I used to teach it, I don't anymore.

Karen Hernandez: It is.

John Rogers: Oh, alright, well, I don't really teach on it, too much.

John Rogers: If ever.

John Rogers: Never. Used to. So an actual eviction is when someone is physically ousted from…

John Rogers: from the, premises. And if someone is actually evicted, there's no obligation to further pay rent.

John Rogers: Partial eviction gets a little bit tricky, because it's like you're partially being evicted. So, you can still live in the apartment, but you just can't use the kitchen.

John Rogers: So, okay.

John Rogers: Great. You could still live in the apartment, but you just can't use any of the toilets.

John Rogers: Oh!

John Rogers: Oh! It's okay. There's still a kitchen sink.

John Rogers: So that's partial eviction, okay?

John Rogers: partial eviction, but I don't really teach that. I don't go into partial eviction very much.

John Rogers: Instead, my entire focus and my love language is… Constructive eviction.

John Rogers: That's my love language.

John Rogers: I love it so much, it's going to be on your final. If it is not on your final, I had an absolute aneurysm.

John Rogers: Okay? Or, I'm not writing the landlord-tenant final.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: But if… I do.

John Rogers: write a landlord-tenant question, I guarantee you this, it's on there.

John Rogers: Constructive eviction.

John Rogers: You know what I wonder? I wonder…

John Rogers: You know, when I meet people's spouses or parents.

John Rogers: like, at graduation, or sometimes I see students, like, at restaurants or something like that. It's really funny, because their spouse goes, like, oh, yeah, I listen to you all the time!

John Rogers: So it's kind of funny, because I sometimes catch myself thinking, I wonder if someone was overhearing what they would think. You know what I mean?

John Rogers: Like, who is that? Because I don't think I teach in the very traditional manner.

John Rogers: And the reason is, is I try to make property fun.

John Rogers: Anyways… Constructive eviction.

John Rogers: Is based on the landlord's omission to do anything.

John Rogers: To the point where the tenant just can't live here anymore.

John Rogers: I need to leave on my own.

John Rogers: So even though, landlord, you're not telling me to leave.

John Rogers: Even though, landlord, you're not picking me up and throwing me out.

John Rogers: I'm, in essence, forced to leave because you won't do anything.

John Rogers: So… You need to identify a problem.

John Rogers: That the landlord can remedy.

John Rogers: That is, in essence, based on the cause of the landlord, in a way.

John Rogers: There are 3 elements.

John Rogers: 2.

John Rogers: constructive eviction.

John Rogers: And one of them is, by far, I put 50% of the points on a final exam just in this one discussion.

John Rogers: Is there a… substantial interference.

John Rogers: NOT.

John Rogers: Is there an interference?

John Rogers: Is there a… substantial.

John Rogers: interference.

John Rogers: And that… interference.

John Rogers: Must be objectively offensive.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Objectively.

John Rogers: I don't care if you individually don't like it.

John Rogers: would a reasonable person in that situation find it offensive, or, consider that to be an interference? Substantial.

John Rogers: So, if, for example, you see, like, a daddy long-leg spider in the corner, you're gonna go, huh, I need out of here! I don't like spiders, I hate them! Oh, God, I hate them! Oh, I need a… get me out of here!

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: That's subjective to you.

John Rogers: Perhaps maybe you're being a bit too subjectively hypersensitive.

John Rogers: Would an objective person find that to be a substantial interference?

John Rogers: Common examples of substantial interference include what I've tested. No hot water.

John Rogers: The existence of toxic mold.

John Rogers: Loud noises from neighbors.

John Rogers: Rodents.

John Rogers: Leaks.

John Rogers: Look for things like that.

Daniel Sinanian: I have a question. Does yelling with your spouse count as loud noises from your neighbor?

John Rogers: You know, it should.

John Rogers: It… it potentially could if it's constantly ongoing and could be considered a nuisance.

John Rogers: I'm… that's interesting.

John Rogers: I don't think so, but maybe if it's constantly ongoing…

Daniel Sinanian: What if you hear them, like, throwing objects? That counts as loud noise?

John Rogers: Well, it could be a nuisance.

John Rogers: So the landlord, if they're on the same premise, and the landlord has control over them, Fix it.

John Rogers: Potentially.

John Rogers: But… I get a little bit cuter.

John Rogers: Smells.

John Rogers: Yeah, he smells. As long as it's caused by the landlord, because here's the thing, if it's across the street.

John Rogers: What's a landlord gonna do?

John Rogers: If it's a smell coming from

John Rogers: you know, the dump. What is the landlord supposed to do? Just spray Febreze next to your door all day?

John Rogers: So, it must be something that the landlord can reasonably correct.

John Rogers: What?

John Rogers: about… Yes.

John Rogers: What happens if you rent a new apartment?

John Rogers: And you find out.

John Rogers: That your next-door neighbor

John Rogers: Is a registered sex offender.

John Rogers: And it's causing you to be fearful and have anxiety.

John Rogers: in your home.

John Rogers: Is that…

John Rogers: A substantial interference, do you think?

John Rogers: What do you think?

Mireya Gonzalez: As much as I want to say yes, it's not something that was caused by the landlord, or it can't be reasonably corrected.

Mireya Gonzalez: So, I'm not too sure how that would play out.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Did they disclose it to the landlord, or no?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Do they have to disclose? No.

Isabella Salahshoor: Don't sex offenders have to disclose themselves?

Isabella Salahshoor: To their neighbors, or is that just, like, if you're in a house?

John Rogers: I mean, isn't it published online?

John Rogers: Can't you get an app?

John Rogers: You get the app.

Isabella Salahshoor: Yeah.

doven: On my credit report, they have

doven: Sex… they show sex offenders in my neighborhood.

John Rogers: Alright? They're everywhere.

John Rogers: But is living next door to a sex offender. And if you're walking by this sex offender.

John Rogers: And you perceive this person to give you weird looks.

John Rogers: That's causing you anxiety.

John Rogers: And… to be fearful.

John Rogers: Is that a substantial interference with the use and enjoyment of your apartment?

Sennett Devermont: Does it matter if they were already living there when you moved in?

Sennett Devermont: And then…

John Rogers: I mean, let's say yes and no. Let's say that they were there before, let's say that, they came right after you.

Fatima Razavi: I feel like it goes back to the smell thing, because it's not under the control of the landlord. It's just like if you lived on top of, like, a pizza place, you can't control it, if there's smells. Like, I used to live in New York City, and I lived close to Little Italy, and it smelled.

Fatima Razavi: And there's nothing they could do about it.

Fatima Razavi: And I think if the sex offender is next door to you, they can't do anything about it. It's not under the landlord's… it's the landlord's problem.

Sennett Devermont: Unless they say no sex offenders live in this building.

Sennett Devermont: And then maybe one did.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Or how about if the fact pattern said, like.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: The building had an obligation to run people's records before they moved in.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: And the landlord didn't.

John Rogers: Maybe. But I don't care about that for right now.

John Rogers: I just want to know what you think.

Amir Akbari: I think if it's before, then you're renting out, renting that, it's your duty to know that, but if it's coming after that, then…

Amir Akbari: I don't know.

Amir Akbari: But before… before… before renting somewhere, it's your duty to look for that, but after…

Amir Akbari: If the sex offender coming after renting, I don't know what happened on that situation.

John Rogers: I mean, what's the problem?

Sennett Devermont: I think a sex offender or someone convicted of a crime has the same right to live.

Sennett Devermont: Anywhere else, and so, like, being your neighbor, it's definitely not going to be a substantial interference, unless the building would say, like, they don't have that… those people there, or they don't allow them, maybe?

John Rogers: Okay…

Mireya Gonzalez: I mean, it says here if the tenant knows of the interference when he or she signed the lease, the court may hold that she… he or she waived the interference.

Mireya Gonzalez: So, I guess it does…

Mireya Gonzalez: it does… it is different if one were to know before of the sex offender, but I would say it is a substantial interference.

John Rogers: Why?

Mireya Gonzalez: Because it's messing with my enjoyment of the home that I live in, of being able to feel comfortable and at peace in the place that I'm supposed to feel most safest.

John Rogers: Well, why?

John Rogers: Why?

John Rogers: Why is it not making you peaceful? What's going on? Tell me.

Mireya Gonzalez: Cause I'm scared that he's gonna, you know… Sexually, you know.

John Rogers: Wait, what?

Mireya Gonzalez: He or she. He or she.

John Rogers: So wait a second, you just assumed it was a he.

John Rogers: You assumed it was a he!

John Rogers: You ALL assumed it was a heat!

Fatima Razavi: It's always a he.

Mireya Gonzalez: Yeah, I agree.

John Rogers: It was a she.

John Rogers: It wouldn't be that bad. I wonder what she did. Right?

John Rogers: That's true, right?

John Rogers: I got that idea because I used to live in Santa Monica.

John Rogers: And my next-door neighbor was a sex offender. I didn't know that for years. Say, what's up? How you doing? Yeah, yeah, we used to chit-chat all the time. And then I got that app, and I was like, dude, this guy, next-door neighbor is a sex offender. I didn't even know it. I had never… never bothered me. I always just still say, hey, what's up? How you doing? The guy was always nice to me.

John Rogers: But I just got that idea, like…

John Rogers: Guy's a sex offender, I didn't even know that. But, you know, you could be a sex offender for urinating in a park twice.

John Rogers: Public urination.

John Rogers: So…

Fatima Razavi: also doesn't open up a can of worms, because then it's like, where does the tenant stop? What makes them uncomfortable?

John Rogers: I think it's a little bit more subjective.

John Rogers: Because I did say this person's giving this person

John Rogers: Looks that they perceive to be weird.

John Rogers: Is that more subjective, then?

John Rogers: Because if you find someone that's ugly, or just unattractive, and they just smile at you to go, that's disgusting. But if you're attracted to them, you're like, oh, wow, that's great, yeah, hey. So it's kind of much more, subjective in a way, right?

John Rogers: So, how do you assess that?

John Rogers: And, it's actually a question that I've given you guys.

John Rogers: Chester, registered sex offender. It's a he, it's gotta be a he. But,

John Rogers: If it was a woman, would you feel the same way?

Mireya Gonzalez: Yes, regardless.

John Rogers: I'm a criminal defense attorney.

John Rogers: And I find things to be funny.

John Rogers: That maybe ordinary people don't.

John Rogers: my… Wi-Fi.

John Rogers: Name.

John Rogers: is… Guess.

Naira Hakobyan: You said it before.

Naira Hakobyan: It's the sex offender, right?

John Rogers: Registered sex offender is my Wi-Fi name. You come to my house, it says, registered sex offender.

John Rogers: And I finally told… the neighbor that lives about 2 growers down in Chicago.

John Rogers: almost killed me. She was, like, trying to track down who it is.

John Rogers: And I was like, yeah, that's me. I told the girls and their parents across the street, yeah, don't worry, it's just me, it's a joke. But,

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: So, it's registered sex offender. Like, I could literally, like, take a screenshot and show you when I don't want to, but yeah.

John Rogers: So, when I got it installed, when I, like, moved.

John Rogers: I had the AT&T guy come over, and the guy, like, I totally forgot about it.

John Rogers: And so he installed it, and he, like, darted out. He, like, bolted out. Too late or bye! And I'm like, what? Why was he… why didn't he say hi? And I'm like, oh, he probably saw the username. So, anyways…

John Rogers: I just want you guys to start thinking about it. But that's all I have. I'm gonna parole you for tonight. I will,

John Rogers: have a session on Saturday at some point, so I will email you all.

John Rogers: But you don't have to go, it's recorded, and I'll do one of the essays that I've given you already.

John Rogers: That's it, I'll stick around if you guys have any questions, otherwise… Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

John Rogers: Next week…

John Rogers: I thought I might have to cancel a class, but it looks like I could finish the semester without canceling a class.

John Rogers: So that's it.

John Rogers: Have a good week.

doven: I wanted to ask a question about distribution. So, actual vision, you can throw some… a landlord can throw somebody out, and that's it?

John Rogers: Well, that's not, I mean, actual eviction?

John Rogers: is physically ousting someone from the premises. So if there's a judicial order.

John Rogers: and the sheriff's department comes and physically excludes someone from the parcel, from the apartment, from the home, wherever, then…

John Rogers: That would be, an eviction.

doven: No more rent or anything.

John Rogers: I forgot to mention, commercial lease versus residential. Shoot.

John Rogers: But the same principles apply.

doven: And so, subjectively, so the reason person subjectively will kind of find something substantially offensive, so a smell inside the house or something, or…

John Rogers: Smell, yeah? Here, look, I have another exam question that I gave out to my class, and one was, the name was smoking.

John Rogers: Smoking a cigarette.

John Rogers: And when I first moved to LA, I lived in this little place.

John Rogers: And it was upstairs. And the downstairs woman, super cool, liked her a lot, was a chain smoker. That's all she'd do, is smoke outside all day. And it used to come up and then come into my place.

John Rogers: And it went on for so long, I didn't even notice.

John Rogers: And smoke doesn't bother me as other… much as other people. Some other people are like, like, you know, whatever. It doesn't bother me. I don't smoke, but I can deal with it, it's fine.

John Rogers: But I didn't notice it.

John Rogers: So when people came over, when I was dating this girl, she came over, and she's like, what the is going on in here? It smells like an ashtray.

John Rogers: And I was like, pfft, I can't smell anything, because I was so used to it.

John Rogers: So it never bothered me. So I have an exam question about someone smoking.

John Rogers: And it going into the… so is that a substantial interference?

John Rogers: Probably yes.

John Rogers: But, to me, personally, it's not. I can deal with it.

John Rogers: But I just didn't realize, because my… all my furniture, my couch, everything smelled like an ashtray. I just didn't know, because I…

John Rogers: Whatever.

Sennett Devermont: But if the smell was cooked food, the bar would be, like, even lower than the smoking of, like, the cigarette, right?

John Rogers: I guess so.

John Rogers: Maybe.

John Rogers: Cooked food. I mean, I could be vegetarian, it could be a barbecue. Oh, no!

John Rogers: But is that ongoing every day, all day?

John Rogers: Notes.

John Rogers: No.

Fatima Razavi: So then, what happened with the sex offender? What did we decide?

John Rogers: At my old place, or is it… what?

Fatima Razavi: No, just in general, if there's a sex offender next door.

John Rogers: Connect you guys? Like, what's up?

Fatima Razavi: What happens when he lives next door to you?

Fatima Razavi: What happens?

John Rogers: Well, here's the thing. Is that…

John Rogers: Within the control of the landlord.

Fatima Razavi: It's not in the control of the landlord.

John Rogers: sure, then there's nothing you can do, but is there substantial interference? We're only discussing that prong that we discussed only. We will discuss the next two, which I don't think are as big, but…

John Rogers: One of them is you have to give the landlord a reasonable amount of time to cure the defect, but how do they do that?

John Rogers: So how do they go to a sex offender and say, stop giving someone weird looks?

John Rogers: What?

John Rogers: That's just my face!

Fatima Razavi: That makes sense. Thank you.

John Rogers: But the test was written so that there is no conclusive right answer.

John Rogers: And I just want to know who wrote he.

John Rogers: I wanna know who says he.

John Rogers: There can be female sex offenders, there can be female sex offenders, remember that. Yes.

John Rogers: They're there.

John Rogers: Any questions?

Mireya Gonzalez: Professor, I do. I… it's more so in regards to last week's question, the essay that we did.

Mireya Gonzalez: I…

John Rogers: was terrible.

Mireya Gonzalez: Yeah, I know, that's why I'm confused too. I was confused

Mireya Gonzalez: Because we didn't talk about the tenants in common that

Mireya Gonzalez: Alice shared with Cara, and then Alice shared with Dan and Ed.

Mireya Gonzalez: So I was wondering if you are able to explain to me why we didn't discuss that in last week's essay.

John Rogers: First off, I need to get everyone's assessment. She does look like the judge I showed you, right? Glasses? I just… I need to…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yep.

John Rogers: We need that, okay, it's established.

John Rogers: So, are you sure we did not… are you saying that we didn't lecture on it, or that I didn't talk about it?

Mireya Gonzalez: No, that… in this essay specifically, like, I'm gonna… I'll send you the… what you had as points to discuss. This is what you had, and we didn't discuss

Mireya Gonzalez: the…

Mireya Gonzalez: tenants in common that Alice shared with Cara. Or not that we didn't discuss it, but it's not… it wasn't, a topic that you put

Mireya Gonzalez: At the bottom.

John Rogers: Yeah, okay. I may have not written it, but I know I said it, because you have your joint tenancy severance. Once it's severed, it would then default to tenants in common. And since someone died, another person succeeded to their interest in tenants in common.

John Rogers: Okay, so that does get possible. But yeah, put tenants in common there.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay, so Alice would have attendance in common with Cara, and then Alice would also have

Mireya Gonzalez: attendance in common with Dan and Ed.

Mireya Gonzalez: Like, do you… that's where I'm stuck, is discussing the two tenants in common with those individuals.

John Rogers: I think you're probably right.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay.

Mireya Gonzalez: Thank you.

John Rogers: Any questions?

Karen Hernandez: I do have a question. In your example, when you said the landlord and tenant enter into a one-year lease, there's a provision that says no subleasing, but the tenant does it anyways?

Karen Hernandez: You said it's not always a breach of contract, but it can be. So how do we decide

Karen Hernandez: If it's not, if it isn't… because then you also said it might not be a sublease, it can be an assignment, so…

John Rogers: Well, you have to… Got it.

John Rogers: sometimes… One of the parties.

John Rogers: we'll say… that they… Subleased.

John Rogers: Or that they assigned.

John Rogers: Okay? Sometimes the fact pattern will say that.

John Rogers: It doesn't necessarily mean that's what Happened, though.

Karen Hernandez: Okay.

John Rogers: So, if you see that provision, that restraint clause. Be suspicious.

John Rogers: Because if it says no subleasing, and the tenant, in fact, does sublease.

Karen Hernandez: Okay.

John Rogers: But… Careful, because that may actually constitute an assignment in our sublease.

John Rogers: to…

Karen Hernandez: Also.

John Rogers: Okay, so when you…

John Rogers: There's two ways to look at it. The minority view, when there's a lease transfer, the minority view.

Karen Hernandez: Hmm.

John Rogers: Is that what the tenant calls the transfer?

John Rogers: It is what it is.

John Rogers: The majority view is, look at the intent and surrounding circumstances.

John Rogers: So it doesn't matter what someone says it is.

Karen Hernandez: Okay.

John Rogers: So… If the provision says no subleasing.

John Rogers: And I transfer my entire lease to Karen, because I am moving indefinitely to Hong Kong.

John Rogers: But I'm saying it's a sublease.

John Rogers: It's actually an assignment.

Karen Hernandez: I see, because it's the whole… you're transferring that whole.

John Rogers: the intent. I'm not.

Karen Hernandez: Okay.

John Rogers: I'm going to Hong Kong.

Karen Hernandez: Okay, yeah, okay, thank you.

Fatima Razavi: Professor, back to the constructive, evictions.

Fatima Razavi: So, let's say there's a rat issue.

Fatima Razavi: So, Anne, how much time…

Fatima Razavi: Do we allow… is there a specific time that you give the landlord to fix it? Is there…

John Rogers: Whatever's reasonable.

Fatima Razavi: Whatever's reasonable.

Fatima Razavi: And then, if he doesn't fix it, or she doesn't fix it, then… Can you do abandonment?

John Rogers: Well, okay, then, was there notice to the landlord, and was there a reasonable opportunity and time to remedy the issue?

Fatima Razavi: And we've established that, and it hasn't.

John Rogers: If not, the person can take off, the landlord will say they abandoned, and the tenant will fire back and say, I was constructively evicted, I don't owe you anything.

Fatima Razavi: Got it. Thank you so much.

John Rogers: But other, other types are, like, broken locks.

John Rogers: So if you have a broken lock, and you live in an apartment complex, and you can't lock your door, is that…

John Rogers: a substantial interference, perhaps.

John Rogers: Perhaps?

John Rogers: But if you were a kid in the 70s and 80s, it's not going to be a big deal. Today, yes, it's a big deal.

John Rogers: Broken locks can constitute, an interference.

Fatima Razavi: Well, can't you just fix it yourself?

John Rogers: It's really complicated, and it's electrical, it's got, like, maybe fob and stuff like that, I don't know.

Fatima Razavi: Well, what if it is something that can be fixed on your own?

Fatima Razavi: Something minor, but it could be, like.

Fatima Razavi: also a major issue. It just depends on how savvy you are in fixing it.

John Rogers: Give me an example. But should I have? Should I?

Fatima Razavi: Maybe, like, A windowsill that doesn't close properly, and it's winter months, and it's snowing outside.

Fatima Razavi: You could hire a handyman to fix it, and just, like, seal it.

John Rogers: Okay, you can do… you can remedy that yourself, and then ask the landlord to deduct that from the rent.

John Rogers: If it costs you \$100, then you say, I want \$100 off my next month's rent.

Fatima Razavi: And what if he doesn't?

John Rogers: If they don't, then you,

John Rogers: If it's a necessary expense, and it's not ordinary, if it's a necessary expense, you can legally withhold it.

John Rogers: You can legally… so they can claim, oh, no, you can't do it, you can't, you can't, you can.

John Rogers: But you can legally withhold it.

Fatima Razavi: Perfect. Thank you.

John Rogers: No questions?

John Rogers: You guys are just on top of it, you don't…

John Rogers: No questions, you just totally get it, you got it, you're confident, property's easy. So you're either in this, so you're either in contracts, torts, and property, or you're either in creme pro, evidence, and property.

John Rogers: or sometimes you're in Chrome Pro, Evidence Property, or CivPro.

John Rogers: Call now right now.

John Rogers: So whether you're a first year or second year, Property's still bad.

John Rogers: Still bad. Because contracts you don't like, it's too dry. Torts, you love, because it's easy, because people get hurt, but property is like, I don't know where to start, I don't like it, and it's probably gonna be the fall class.

John Rogers: But if you're second here, let's put in your CRIMP Pro, you have evidence and property. CRIMPRO's super easy, I totally get it, I'm totally gonna ace the class.

John Rogers: evidence, I have no idea what's going on, it's really hard, it's another language property I haven't really, you know, looked at, it's gonna be the fall class.

John Rogers: It's usually what happens.

John Rogers: Typical.

John Rogers: But I told you guys from the very beginning, this is gonna be the worst class you're gonna take. This will be the worst class.

John Rogers: Oh, hopefully.

John Rogers: I was right.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): It's tough, but not insurmountable. I mean,

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): what's great about, you know, sailing into the last few weeks is, I have found

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Hurdles, you know, overcoming study hurdles.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): So, it comes together, and, you know, just by writing, I've been doing a lot of essays and a lot of MBEs, and it fits.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): But it took to week 11 or so before some of this made sense.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): So…

John Rogers: Yeah?

John Rogers: I agree.

Mireya Gonzalez: Landlord's definitely easier than present and future interest, that's where I'm struggling.

John Rogers: I don't know this.

John Rogers: Everyone struggles on it.

John Rogers: Don't kill yourself on it, I don't think.

John Rogers: Like I said, I'm not gonna test on anything you haven't seen before.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Great, that's great.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Thank you.

gevorg kulikyan: Professor, for, analyzing substantial interference, how much do you care about our…

gevorg kulikyan: Like, conclusion on whether… does it matter?

John Rogers: I never care.

gevorg kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: Never care.

John Rogers: if you took… ever took me for evidence, I'd be… I'd tell my guys, I don't know, write whatever you want. I have no idea. I don't even know.

John Rogers: So, I like exams that are like that. I like exams where you just don't know.

John Rogers: That's what I like most.

John Rogers: Because if you don't really know, it's vague. That's the beauty of it.

John Rogers: I hate being, like, precise.

John Rogers: I hate precise.

John Rogers: I don't like it. I like… I don't know.

John Rogers: That's the… That's what I like the most.

John Rogers: That's the love language. Vagueness is love language.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Thank you, Professor. Enjoy your weekend.

Mireya Gonzalez: Sorry, I'm not done. The duty to mitigate, that applies both To surrender and abandonment?

John Rogers: Well, it's not gonna apply to surrender.

John Rogers: Because the landlord has to agree to it.

John Rogers: So, if the landlord agrees and there's been a surrender, then it's done. There's no obligation for the tenant to pay rent. And since there's no longer an obligation.

John Rogers: The landlord's not trying to collect any future rent.

Mireya Gonzalez: It says right here, the landlord may reject the tenant's offer to surrender and keep the tenant on the lease, subject to the landlord's duty to mitigate.

John Rogers: So it says, like, look, if you are my tenant, and you want to leave, and you offer to terminate as a surrender.

John Rogers: and I say, No?

John Rogers: and you leave, I still have to mitigate.

Mireya Gonzalez: I see, okay.

Mireya Gonzalez: So then how does that not apply to surrender, if you don't… If you just…

John Rogers: How does that not apply to… okay. So, if you want to surrender, and I agree to it, done.

John Rogers: You don't owe me any rent.

John Rogers: But if I say no, and you leave and you don't pay me, I have to mitigate because I want to collect what you owe me.

John Rogers: You're not off the hook, you still have to pay me.

John Rogers: I didn't agree to your surrender.

Mireya Gonzalez: Would you still speak about the duty to mitigate? If…

John Rogers: If there's been a surrender.

Mireya Gonzalez: Yeah, I'm just confused on… on…

Mireya Gonzalez: Because you just said we… he's… the landlord still has to mitigate to find someone to hold that lease.

Mireya Gonzalez: Due to the original tenant surrendering.

John Rogers: If there is, no, abandonment… versus surrender. If there's an abandonment, yes.

John Rogers: Mitigate, or else you're not gonna collect. If there's been a surrender.

John Rogers: and we agree to terminate it, how am I gonna go out? Why do I have to mitigate what?

John Rogers: It's done. The lease is terminated. Like, I terminated it early. So you have no obligations to me. I can't collect next month's rent because I terminated it right now.

John Rogers: That make sense?

gevorg kulikyan: Nevertheless.

gevorg kulikyan: No, they're not visible.

gevorg kulikyan: Yes.

Mireya Gonzalez: Sorry, the connection… glitched.

John Rogers: Did I answer your question?

Mireya Gonzalez: It stopped after you said…

Mireya Gonzalez: when it's accepted. If you said if it was rejected, I didn't hear any of it.

John Rogers: Okay, so if there has been a surrender, so you want to terminate and I accept.

John Rogers: It's done, right? The lease is done.

Mireya Gonzalez: Right, I understand that one.

John Rogers: So, you're not gonna be owing me rent next month.

Mireya Gonzalez: Right.

John Rogers: was terminated.

John Rogers: But if I say NO, I don't agree.

John Rogers: You're gonna owe me rent next month, right?

John Rogers: But you're not gonna pay me.

John Rogers: You took off.

John Rogers: So, in order for me to collect next month's rent, or at least try to from you.

John Rogers: I have to mitigate. So knowing that you took off, I have to try to find a new tenant. And if I don't make those efforts, I can't claim next month's rent. I can't go after you in court for what you owe me for next month, because I didn't try to mitigate it.

Mireya Gonzalez: Okay, now I see how that correlated. Okay, thank you.

Mireya Gonzalez: Sorry about that.

John Rogers: Do you still have that, paper textbook that you made?

Mireya Gonzalez: I still have it, I do.

John Rogers: Okay.

Mireya Gonzalez: It has notes in it, so I keep it.

Mireya Gonzalez: I have your outline paper.

John Rogers: Oh, okay, alright.

John Rogers: Now, here's the thing, guys, and this is what I get very worried about, okay? This is what I get very worried about.

John Rogers: is that… These concepts are kind of dense, and especially present and future interests can get very dense.

John Rogers: Now, you're really focused on just trying to understand it and learn it.

John Rogers: But… Do you know how to explain it?

John Rogers: Because you can know everything.

John Rogers: But if I'm reading this, and you're not explaining it, it's substandard, you're gonna get whacked.

John Rogers: And make sure you remember that.

John Rogers: Are you properly explaining this versus… Just knowing it.

John Rogers: Because a lot of students come to me.

John Rogers: first, second semester, and say, hey, I got a C in your class, but I knew everything. Like, I tutored all these people.

John Rogers: It's like, well, look, Didn't explain yourself.

John Rogers: It's not a… The test is, can you explain this to me?

John Rogers: not.

John Rogers: Do you know this?

John Rogers: That's what it is. So just remember that, okay?

gevorg kulikyan: Was there a page limit on your essays, Professor?

John Rogers: It's gonna be 15 pages, double-spaced.

gevorg kulikyan: 15.

John Rogers: You don't have to use all…

gevorg kulikyan: 50.

John Rogers: School gets mad at me for that, by the way.

John Rogers: Because the students submit 45 pages. It's like a thick bunch of pieces of paper.

John Rogers: School has to… print it out, and staple it, and all that stuff. They don't like doing…

Karen Hernandez: Thank you, Professor.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Amir Akbari: I just want to see… Thank you so much for this perfect notes.

Amir Akbari: It's so helpful.

John Rogers: The perfect notes. The perfect notes. The perfect notes.

Amir Akbari: It's really helpful.

John Rogers: Is it helpful?

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: It's the same thing as evidence. I just put it on PowerPoint slides for evidence.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, but I have the evidence version of that for myself. I made it, but…

Amir Akbari: I'm still struggling. Yeah, I'm gonna get A on real property, but D on the evidence. On evidence? Are you sure, yeah.

John Rogers: Should I make an outline for evidence and just not do slides?

John Rogers: What do you think?

Amir Akbari: I think, yes.

John Rogers: Because…

Amir Akbari: For me, yes.

Amir Akbari: It's like, when you see the rules and you are highlighted the rule, you are sure that's the rule.

Amir Akbari: You don't go…

John Rogers: Put it on a slide!

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: I put it on a slide! It's right there! It's the rule! It's right there, you can see it!

Amir Akbari: Yeah, but you get chunk of it, you know, with the highlighting, you see, okay, that is the scope of the rule.

John Rogers: All you gotta do is just copy, paste on a piece of.

Amir Akbari: I did. I can send it to you, I have the whole.

John Rogers: I don't care that you send it, I'm just saying, what's better? Because I'm not going to do both.

John Rogers: I'm not gonna do both.

John Rogers: I'm not gonna give you an outline and do the slides.

Amir Akbari: No, no, the outline is perfect.

Amir Akbari: But maybe because nature of cats.

John Rogers: Of course, you know. Maybe I will, because if I give you guys an outline and evidence in advance, I don't have to cover as much and say so much.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, even the… I read the whole examples on the evidence, but it's hard.

John Rogers: It's a lot.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, it's a lot.

John Rogers: That's a lot!

Amir Akbari: Duh.

Amir Akbari: Even here is so helpful, the examples are… Perfect.

John Rogers: Okay, so maybe I may make an evidence outline then. We'll see.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, I can send my version from your… the whole…

John Rogers: I don't care about you, I'll do it myself.

Amir Akbari: You, you can delete it.

John Rogers: But I'll probably make one next year, not next semester.

John Rogers: It's just gonna take a while.

Leanna Badar: Professor Rogers, do you send your evidence outlines to students that aren't in your class?

John Rogers: Anna, you just… your voice is, like, a love language to me.

John Rogers: I would love to hear it more often. Geez, it's like a poem!

John Rogers: Jeez, would love to hear it more often in class.

John Rogers: What was your question?

Leanna Badar: Oh, if you'll send the evidence outlines, or, like, your PowerPoint to students who aren't in your class?

John Rogers: Yes, there's students that are… that are added

John Rogers: Yes, there's, like, at least… what class are you in?

Leanna Badar: I'm in, professor Sebastian.

John Rogers: Yeah, there's about 5 people in his class that are on my email list, so they always get my site each week.

Leanna Badar: Can I email you to add me on, Seoul?

John Rogers: Yeah, but I mean, we're weak.

John Rogers: 13… I mean, just ask me, I'll give you all the sides.

Leanna Badar: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: It's a lot, though.

John Rogers: Huh, so she's one of the peasants.

John Rogers: She's one of the peasants.

John Rogers: I always tell my class, Sebastian's class is littered with peasants.

John Rogers: The peasants don't learn this, but we will.

John Rogers: It's… it's just a joke. It's a joke.

John Rogers: It's a joke.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: What time is your review gonna be on Saturday? Do you know yet?

John Rogers: Probably from 10 to 12, 10.30 to 12.30, so I'll probably do an hour of evidence.

John Rogers: and then an hour of property. I don't know which will go first, so should I do property first, or should I do evidence first? What do you think?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Property Second?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: So, 11.30 or 12.30? Okay. Whatever works for you, I mean… I don't know if it's first and property second.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: So then we can use the extra time at the end to ask you more things.

John Rogers: Yes! Yes! That is calculated, I like that. I like that. That is calculated.

John Rogers: We're not quite sure.

John Rogers: That is good, I like that. I like that.

John Rogers: Yes, the evidence. Peasants.

Sennett Devermont: I had a quick question to take us, like, kind of way back, but whether it's in,

Sennett Devermont: Whether it's an estate in life or a fee, like, for example, X… Ecuatory limitation.

Sennett Devermont: in the life estate for executory limitation, I look for remainder.

Sennett Devermont: And is that same for if it's in fee?

Sennett Devermont: Like… or no, it's different. Or do I look for… is there a remainder? Do I look for a remainder in a fee simple subject to executory limitation?

Sennett Devermont: Or no.

John Rogers: What's the rule for a remainder?

Sennett Devermont: I don't have… I mean, I… You got it! You definitely got it! It's in my notes. No, I definitely have it. I… I… so I understand that, like, it's shifting or springing for executory interest…

John Rogers: I wanna know what the rule is.

Sennett Devermont: legs.

John Rogers: For a remainder. That's it. What's the rule for a remainder?

Sennett Devermont: It is in your great…

John Rogers: Anyone… can anyone help him?

John Rogers: Remainder. What's the rule?

Sennett Devermont: A remainder is…

Sennett Devermont: A future interest created in a grantee transferee that is capable, but not certain, of becoming business-free.

John Rogers: Now read very slowly the next couple of words.

Sennett Devermont: Of becoming possessory upon the natural expiration of the preceding estate.

John Rogers: So, if it's a fee, there's no natural expiration.

John Rogers: Because it's gonna go on forever. Potentially.

Sennett Devermont: Yeah, this helped a lot.

Sennett Devermont: And that's why it's shifting or springing.

Sennett Devermont: Good night.

John Rogers: that it would.

Sennett Devermont: Or, or…

John Rogers: He would be shifting executor interest.

Sennett Devermont: Per… per feet, okay.

Sennett Devermont: Okay, that actually helps, thank you.

Amir Akbari: I have a question about the, conveyance when it has, the Shelly's case.

Amir Akbari: And, restraint of alienation, and, rap.

Amir Akbari: Which one we should go first?

John Rogers: The one that would be the best to solve the easiest.

Amir Akbari: So, solve the easiest, okay.

John Rogers: Why do it hard? No, I would always let… Simplify things. I'd like that.

Amir Akbari: Okay, you mean that most probably, Shelly's case is going to merge two of them together? First, it's going to make it simpler, then we can go to the restraint of automation, and then…

Amir Akbari: But, is it, is it something that, the answers could be different, or no?

John Rogers: I… Potentially, but…

Amir Akbari: here's.

John Rogers: I will grade it in a way that if you do go a certain direction, I can't hold that against you.

John Rogers: Don't worry about that, okay?

Amir Akbari: Okay.

Amir Akbari: Yeah.

John Rogers: As long as there's a reasonable… direction that you took, fine.

Amir Akbari: Okay, yeah, that's the best answer, because the simplest way is just going through the simplest as possible for…

John Rogers: I just… here's the thing, it's unfair for me to say, well, I like it this way, and you didn't do it, so I'm gonna mark you down, I'm not gonna give you points. It's just… that's… that's bull.

John Rogers: I don't… I don't think that's right.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, I just wanna know if it's, like, there is a priority, or there's a rule to apply? No. Okay.

Amir Akbari: Thanks. I got my ass.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

Amir Akbari: Have a good night. Thank you so much.

John Rogers: Am I paroled? Am I paroled for the night?

John Rogers: I'm paroled, I'm paroled?

Sennett Devermont: Thanks, Professor, have a good night.

John Rogers: Alright, I'll see you guys. Thank you.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Thank you.

gevorg kulikyan: Professor.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Question or no?

gevorg kulikyan: No, I said thank you.

John Rogers: Oh, alright guys.
