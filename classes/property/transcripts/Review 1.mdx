# Property - Session 

## Transcript

John Rogers: Okay, I'm recording now.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Good morning!

John Rogers: Morning.

John Rogers: Happy Saturday!

John Rogers: I was gonna say…

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Excuse me.

John Rogers: I wish I was in the park on my laptop right now, you know, outside.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Oh, it's brilliant out there. I'm up in Seattle right now, and it's just pouring. I didn't know… is it, storms made it down to LA yet?

John Rogers: Yeah, it's raining.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Oh, yeah, it's a big storm.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Still fun to be outside, though.

John Rogers: So, I wasn't planning on covering an essay today, I was planning to…

John Rogers: Cover just some concepts and stuff like that.

John Rogers: Is that okay with everyone?

Ravinder Ghuman: Yes.

John Rogers: Kind of a… Quick, condensed review of things.

John Rogers: Hold on.

John Rogers: One second, I just need to check the book up for something real quick.

John Rogers: Sorry.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): No worries.

John Rogers: Hmm…

John Rogers: First off, just address, does anybody have any questions in regards to adverse possession in particular?

Jude Seleck: Actually, I have a question, less…

Jude Seleck: week we said that, adverse possessor cannot

Jude Seleck: Adverse to possess against future interest holder, right?

John Rogers: Yes.

Jude Seleck: Does this mean that… so, if the current…

Jude Seleck: Interest holder is a, life estate. Adverse possessor can only

Jude Seleck: Adverse to possess for the life estate, and when this person dies, he has no longer

Jude Seleck: Possesses it, right?

John Rogers: That is 100% correct.

John Rogers: That is 100% correct. I love that question.

Jude Seleck: Thanks.

Jude Seleck: Alright.

John Rogers: Let's talk about that.

John Rogers: So,

John Rogers: So, if it reads something like this, for example, O to A for life, then to B.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: You'd break this down like this. Presumably has an FSA, A, has a present possessory interest in a life.

John Rogers: a state with A being the measuring life.

John Rogers: and then B… has an indefeasible vested.

John Rogers: Remainder.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, if C… adversely possesses… Black Acre.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: during a… what?

John Rogers: Read AI Meeting Notes is requesting to record this meeting. No problem, Read AI.

John Rogers: During a's lifetime.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: A… C, sorry.

John Rogers: C, if C… satisfies it.

John Rogers: C would have, not a fee simple absolute, C would only gain adverse possession for A's life. So it would almost be like a life estate per atre vie.

John Rogers: I think that's how it is.

John Rogers: The reason is, is because C can only possess this, and since B is a future interest holder, you cannot adversely possess a future interest holder.

John Rogers: Okay? So the moment then A dies, adverse possession, starts all over against B.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: So… Remember that.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Would you have two adverse possession conversations?

John Rogers: I… wouldn't. And I'm going to verify the page length.

John Rogers: So, I will write a very Nice email.

John Rogers: Instructing the class that if you're really confined on a page limit, I'll be very relaxed.

John Rogers: Okay, so I wouldn't… Just… stand by.

John Rogers: I would not necessarily Some students, when there involves, like, tacking, Some students…

John Rogers: write two adverse possession discussions. I don't think that's necessary, but if you want, you can. I just don't think it's necessary.

John Rogers: So if you want to combine them into one discussion, that's perfectly fine. I would actually prefer that more, because it's less effort on my eyes.

John Rogers: So… I… But… I can't say…

John Rogers: But if it's, like, a different adverse possessor on a separate piece of land.

John Rogers: Then, yeah, it's requiring a different discussion.

John Rogers: So,

John Rogers: It requires a separate discussion.

John Rogers: Does that make sense?

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: Let's… Do something else.

John Rogers: So, if it were to be, like, O, 2A for life, then 2B, just like above.

John Rogers: It would be the same discussion here. Same discussion, okay?

John Rogers: Same discussion.

John Rogers: But if A, let's say A then sells in phi simple absolute to C.

John Rogers: What does C have?

Jude Seleck: Life is state troopy.

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: Now… by saying phi simple absolute to C, A cannot convey.

John Rogers: more than what A has.

John Rogers: So it's kind of presumed that aid meant to sell or convey all of A's interest.

John Rogers: which is only… an estate for A's life.

John Rogers: So C would take what A has.

John Rogers: K.

John Rogers: C takes what A has, but it's not for C's life, because O never said to O to A for life, unless, you know, A conveys to C, and then it goes to C for life. It's just A for life.

John Rogers: So T, C takes what A has.

John Rogers: Which is A's life estate.

John Rogers: So, C has a present possessory interest in a life estate with… A being the measuring life.

John Rogers: So, it's a life estate per…

John Rogers: I don't know if I'm spelling this right. Is it V, V, they, V, they? Doesn't matter, you know.

John Rogers: Okay.

Abram Meza: Professor, would there be any color or title issues if he really felt he had a fee simple and tried to sell that to somebody else?

John Rogers: I don't think so, because… C in… or A did, in fact, have title, just not as much.

John Rogers: But, you know, see… see…

John Rogers: If the fact pattern perhaps lends itself for that discussion. Sometimes the fact pattern will say, you know, sold the southern half of

John Rogers: Or someone is using only the southern half of Black Acre or something.

John Rogers: then maybe it's worth a discussion. Creative discussion. Can't lose points discussing it.

John Rogers: When you write, The hardest thing, I think, in

John Rogers: when you're writing this, is you can identify it, but a lot of examinees, students, don't really know how to break it down. So the best way to break something down is

John Rogers: Have at least two sentences.

John Rogers: Is the estate a present interest or a future interest? And then what is it, exactly? So, 2A for life, you can say it's present possessory because it's 2A.

John Rogers: This present possessory interest will last for the duration of A's life, as evidenced by 4 life.

John Rogers: Therefore, A has a present sensory interest and a life estate.

John Rogers: There you go.

John Rogers: A lot of students just say, A has a life estate because 2A for life. Goodbye.

John Rogers: So just be very careful.

John Rogers: So you want to break things down.

John Rogers: Huh?

John Rogers: Questions so far?

Sennett Devermont: I had a question when you said the adverse possession starts all over again when it dies in the first scenario.

John Rogers: Yep.

Sennett Devermont: Is that, like, automatically, or based on the facts? Like, what if B doesn't know, like, doesn't see it, or certain things, it automatically starts, or that's the discussion you have based on…

John Rogers: It's just, it doesn't matter if B knew or doesn't know.

John Rogers: It's just… that's when the clock starts.

Sennett Devermont: And would there be discussion that, like, there's no tacking here because it just restarts, or you wouldn't even mention tacking?

John Rogers: I wouldn't mention tacking because there isn't successive adverse possessors.

John Rogers: The difference is there's different owners, but there's an intervening act between them, and that is a different interest now.

John Rogers: One dies, one takes over.

John Rogers: I think it…

John Rogers: Yes. So, you wouldn't discuss tacking, because tacking is specific to adverse possessors, the trespasser, not new owners.

John Rogers: For example, if A has an FSA, okay, V simple absolute, B,

John Rogers: Or, let's say at… Geez, Trespasser, Ted the Trespasser. Ted is T.

John Rogers: adversely possesses Blackacre, okay?

John Rogers: a cells to be.

John Rogers: Clock… Does not start over again.

John Rogers: Because B is not a future interest holder, B wasn't named in any conveyance or will, it was just a sale.

John Rogers: Sorry.

John Rogers: I'm text messaging someone.

John Rogers: Someone related to this class.

John Rogers: Or… Related to another.

John Rogers: Real property class.

John Rogers: I'm gonna revise my representation of the length of the exam, and I will let you guys know next week.

John Rogers: How many pages you guys will have to write.

John Rogers: Questions so far?

Gevorg Kulikyan: Good question, Professor.

Gevorg Kulikyan: So, when somebody adversely possesses a life estate, like, it was just O2A for life, and C,

Gevorg Kulikyan: Adversely possesses 8.

Gevorg Kulikyan: It is still only for the length of A's life.

John Rogers: That's correct. Because the future interest holder, who has the reversion, I assume is O, or O's errors. Yeah.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Now, coat,

John Rogers: When you see remainder, okay, The best way for a discussion is, first discuss…

John Rogers: How is this a remainder?

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: And then you discuss vested or contingent.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: And then, if it's contingent, explain why. Contingent?

John Rogers: Is there, condition?

John Rogers: to fulfill?

John Rogers: Or unascertainable person.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: vested.

John Rogers: It's 3. Infeasible, it's, subject to open.

John Rogers: Or, it's, subject to complete the investment.

John Rogers: So, just kind of, when you write, you want to write very mechanical. Just break it down.

John Rogers: You don't have to put separate paragraphs, just…

John Rogers: It can be all one paragraph, that's fine.

John Rogers: I don't… as far as organization, okay.

John Rogers: what I, in the… The best way

John Rogers: For organization, for example, would be just, like, like, adverse possession?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: You'd probably put actual… And then, open and notorious.

John Rogers: Ugh.

John Rogers: Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

John Rogers: If… And when you have a discussion.

John Rogers: It's always easier to, you know, you have to put a rule, and then you have your discussion.

John Rogers: And then you have a conclusion for each requirement, okay?

John Rogers: Don't put your conclusion

John Rogers: in your discussion, and I see that happening a lot, so don't. It's one very short

John Rogers: Very short sentence, okay? Conclusion is a very short sentence.

John Rogers: If you have a page restriction, and I will not hold this against you, I give you my word, okay?

John Rogers: But if you have a page restriction, and maybe it would take up a lot of space on an answer.

John Rogers: You can simply put, adverse possession, okay, so just make it one header.

John Rogers: Give the rule, and then you can jumble it up in a single paragraph if you want to save space.

John Rogers: That's not a problem, okay?

John Rogers: And maybe you can just say, you know.

John Rogers: In your discussions is, say, open, and… Notorious… ugh!

John Rogers: requires… Whatever. We say here, blah blah blah blah blah blah, blah, blah.

John Rogers: blah, blah, blah. Okay?

John Rogers: And then you can say, hostile, requires… You can say here… Wah.

John Rogers: blah. Okay? And at the very end, you can say, like, therefore, or thus, whatever you want,

John Rogers: Okay, well… Well, not.

John Rogers: Succeed to adverse possession.

John Rogers: Blah, blah, blah.

John Rogers: So, that's really if there's a page restriction, and this is absolutely fine.

John Rogers: But students do have a tendency to write very big paragraphs.

John Rogers: And sometimes, they don't write enough for, for example, hostile.

John Rogers: Maybe there could be a big discussion there?

John Rogers: And you are kind of subconsciously telling yourself, I've written so much.

John Rogers: I don't have to write a lot for hostile. And you do.

John Rogers: So just be very careful, okay? So just because you're right in this big paragraph doesn't mean that every single discussion is very short.

John Rogers: look… Look deep, okay?

John Rogers: But what I'm getting at here is that you can have one big jolly paragraph if you want, that's fine, because I understand if there's a page restriction.

John Rogers: I don't want to hold that.

John Rogers: I just don't want that.

John Rogers: organization to conflict with discussion. Make sense?

John Rogers: Yeah, hand raised.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: For, adverse possession, other than hostile, what do you think is our other bigger conversation? Is it just, do you think, hostile, or is it depending on a case-to-case situation, or…

John Rogers: I mean, I don't want you to take that as a hint on your final. I… please don't.

John Rogers: Like, I'm not saying hostile is…

John Rogers: an issue at all. I just… wrote it.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: In an example, okay.

John Rogers: Just don't… don't take that as, as any hint whatsoever, okay?

John Rogers: It could be exclusive, it could be, tacky, it could be anything. Just, just be careful, just

John Rogers: that… If you write a lot.

John Rogers: But if you break it down, it might not actually be a lot.

John Rogers: So don't… just make sure you fully discuss everything.

John Rogers: And not just think, I have this big paragraph, it's gonna be fine already, as is.

dovenight: her hair.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, at what point would we… like, in the adverse possession analysis, at which point would we talk about, like, the,

Gevorg Kulikyan: Where one cannot adversely possess a future interest holder.

John Rogers: I don't know, figure it out.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Would that just be its own, like, subsection?

John Rogers: Me too.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Just in case we need it.

John Rogers: Yeah, that's a good question.

John Rogers: Well, here's the thing.

John Rogers: You may not necessarily have to write it, so if, for example, the fact pattern lends itself to that discussion.

John Rogers: then you… your conclusion would be that C succeeds to adverse possession against A's interest, and A's interest only.

John Rogers: There you go.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay, I get it.

John Rogers: If that is an issue.

John Rogers: So, going back to vested remainders, contingent remainders.

John Rogers: What is the difference between a vested remainder and a contingent remainder?

John Rogers: Did anybody know?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Vested is in a remainder and a living person.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: ascertainable.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: Am I dark? It seems… dark. I don't… this is a guest room, and I don't have a lot of light in here. Natural light, there's only one window in here.

John Rogers: It seems kind of dark.

Amir Akbari: And vested remainder doesn't have the condition precedent, right?

John Rogers: Yeah, there's no condition.

Amir Akbari: Because it's wasted.

John Rogers: Because it's vested, that's right.

John Rogers: So… O?

John Rogers: 2A for life… then to B, if… B…

John Rogers: gets an A-plus in evidence.

John Rogers: Good luck with that.

John Rogers: So… O?

John Rogers: would have, presumably, an FSA. A would have, what, a present accessory interest in a life estate, with A being the measuring life.

John Rogers: And B would have a what?

John Rogers: Continent remainder…

John Rogers: Oh, we then have a reversion.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: that… But let's also discuss… this, okay?

John Rogers: You know, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

John Rogers: Hold on a second. Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.

John Rogers: Hold on.

John Rogers: Hold on.

John Rogers: Calm down, everyone, hold on.

John Rogers: what is going on here? And it's something I really… Didn't teach too well.

John Rogers: much. It was very vague.

John Rogers: A has a present possessory interest in a life estate, with A being the measuring life.

John Rogers: B has what?

Jude Seleck: B and C are alternating, contingent remainders.

John Rogers: Oh, man, B is a contingent remainder.

John Rogers: C is an alternate… contingent remainder, okay?

John Rogers: We didn't really learn that too much, okay? But just notice, C is not subject to anything. It's only if another event or condition happens that's outside of C's power.

John Rogers: As an alternative, it goes to C.

John Rogers: I opened my book because I'm trying to figure out where it was in the book.

John Rogers: And my memory… I have more of a black belt memory of the 9th edition.

John Rogers: So, I don't see it in the 10th, but, I want to cover that.

Sennett Devermont: You have in your notes that, the book doesn't go over it.

Sennett Devermont: It says alter… There is a concept called alternative contingent.

John Rogers: Alternate or Alternative? I think it's Alternative.

Sennett Devermont: It says alternative in your notes.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Sennett Devermont: Is there a rule for that? We could, like…

Sennett Devermont: Use, or put in the outline?

John Rogers: Oh…

John Rogers: I… don't know.

John Rogers: I guess I can revise it, and maybe…

John Rogers: Burning time, hold on.

John Rogers: Come on!

John Rogers: modern executive orders.

John Rogers: We might have it in here somewhere.

John Rogers: Yeah, they took it out. They took it out of the 10th edition! Oh, they took it out of the 10th, because I have the 9th as well.

John Rogers: I'm gonna write this from the 9th edition, okay?

John Rogers: This is straight from the book, 9th edition.

John Rogers: This is straight from the 9th edition, but they took it out of the 10th edition, okay?

John Rogers: Alternative contingent remainder, okay?

John Rogers: Let's talk about co-tenancies. Oh…

Amir Akbari: Quick question. Yeah. At this example that we did, O has a reversion, right, at the end.

John Rogers: Yes.

Amir Akbari: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: Actually, no. My apologies, you're right. There's gonna be no reversion here, because one or the other should get it, because…

Amir Akbari: About if…

John Rogers: It's…

Amir Akbari: He doesn't get…

John Rogers: If B gets the A+, it becomes vested. If B doesn't get the A+, C's gets vested. So there is no, .

Amir Akbari: Oh, my bad. Yeah, I thought the second IF is for C. My bad.

dovenight: I want that… that looks so long.

John Rogers: You'd be okay.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Professor, there's no rules against perpetuity discussion there?

John Rogers: There is.

Gevorg Kulikyan: Okay.

John Rogers: there would be.

John Rogers: But let's talk about rap, since you mentioned it. Let's talk about U.S. wrap, as I mentioned, okay?

John Rogers: U.S. Wrap.

John Rogers: This is subject… an alternative contingent remainder is…

John Rogers: a contingent remainder, so it is subject to wrap. So, if it's a modern fact pattern, for example, okay?

John Rogers: The first approach, first, there's two steps, two steps to take, okay?

John Rogers: Two steps to take.

John Rogers: The first step is apply common law route, okay?

John Rogers: Just how we learned in the comma law, comma law will comma law, everything, okay?

John Rogers: If it fails, or it's void, okay.

John Rogers: Then move to 2.

John Rogers: Which is, wait 90 years.

John Rogers: To see if the interests vests.

John Rogers: within… That 90 years.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: That is exactly what you have to do.

John Rogers: If it does not vest, At all, within that 90-year period.

John Rogers: It's void.

John Rogers: If the interest vests within that 90-year period, it's valid, it's okay.

John Rogers: So, O to A for life, then to… B…

John Rogers: These, children who reach 22.

John Rogers: B has two children.

John Rogers: C equals, 21, and… D, equals 20.

John Rogers: Let's apply U.S. wrap.

John Rogers: Number one, we apply the common law.

John Rogers: We're focused on this, okay?

John Rogers: Is this valid or void under the common law?

Jude Seleck: weren't.

Amir Akbari: valid.

Amir Akbari: Because it's gonna go to O. If A and B dies, it's gonna go back to O, right?

John Rogers: Go back to my notes. Remember? Children who must reach the age of 22?

John Rogers: Or more is always void.

John Rogers: Always. Every time.

John Rogers: Under the common law.

John Rogers: But U.S. wrap, we go wait and see.

John Rogers: Let's see if their interest vests within 90 years.

dovenight: So…

John Rogers: For example, if A dies… 20 years later, and…

John Rogers: D and C are 31 and 30, they're vested.

John Rogers: Boom! So it would be valid if that's the case.

John Rogers: Okay?

dovenight: This alternate constant tension remainder is a hint, or might be, On that final.

John Rogers: I'm not saying that.

John Rogers: Can't say that.

John Rogers: What about O2A and B as joint tenants in common, joint tenants with… Right of survivorship.

John Rogers: You don't necessarily need, under the common law, common law, requires four unities. Modernly, It's just specific language.

John Rogers: from O… Intending to create a joint tenancy.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, this right of survivorship is very controlling, plus the… oh, sorry, joint tenants. I mean, it's completely spelled out.

John Rogers: about O2A… And B for life.

John Rogers: as joint… 10 minutes… With a right of survivorship.

John Rogers: This is different because we have A and B, so the maximum amount of time they could have it for is the duration of one of their lives.

John Rogers: So, if B dies, or A dies… Oh!

John Rogers: B succeeds to 100% ownership in life!

John Rogers: So B has a present possessory interest in a life estate, with B being the measuring life.

Amir Akbari: And here, too, O has a reversion.

John Rogers: Now, just to apply the rule against perpetuities.

John Rogers: Oh, we already did our answer. Go ahead.

Amir Akbari: Paul has a reversion here, right?

John Rogers: Yes.

John Rogers: Correct.

John Rogers: And if B… Sells her interest.

John Rogers: To see, what does C have?

Amir Akbari: be simple, absolute.

Amir Akbari: No, just for Life of the Bee Pro B, per… Awesome.

Amir Akbari: Okay.

Amir Akbari: In French, they say pour autre vie.

Amir Akbari: If you want to say the French one.

John Rogers: A bit French.

Amir Akbari: Yeah, I know for.

John Rogers: How many languages do you speak?

Amir Akbari: for…

John Rogers: What are they? English?

John Rogers: Not Friday.

Amir Akbari: I need… 4C… and Turkey.

Amir Akbari: Or occasion.

John Rogers: I feel like an idiot.

John Rogers: I'm very jealous of people that could speak multiple languages.

John Rogers: It's jealousy, or hate, whatever you want to call it, same thing.

John Rogers: Because I can't.

John Rogers: I just speak gibberish.

John Rogers: Questions so far?

dovenight: Do we get this paper?

John Rogers: Oh, man, I don't know if I'm gonna give you this paper.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: You're gonna have to review this again.

John Rogers: Any questions?

dovenight: But to find out, did you mention about how many pages it's gonna be?

John Rogers: I think, I think I misrepresented and said 25 pages for each essay. I think it's 30 pages total.

John Rogers: I will email everyone. I'm not really supposed to tell you, but I don't think it's gonna harm you in advance if I do tell you, so I think it would probably be 10 pages per essay.

John Rogers: Or, like, 30 pages total.

John Rogers: All I care about is 30 pages total. So, from…

John Rogers: It's 30 pages, so if one is 12 pages and another one is 8, that's fine.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor, can you scroll up a little bit?

Agnes Gholoonian: the contingent remainder portion. Just, I want to make sure I got it down.

Agnes Gholoonian: A little bit higher, right there, stop.

John Rogers: This is copied and pasted verbatim in the 9th edition book. It's not in the 10th edition.

Agnes Gholoonian: A sub X ANF.

Agnes Gholoonian: Okay, got it, thanks.

John Rogers: Any questions, guys?

dovenight: I got here late, but I'll watch the recording, the first one minute.

John Rogers: Okay.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Can you go over, maybe, like, an, Shelly's case example, or any of… Something like that.

John Rogers: I've gone through the same example of Shelly's case.

John Rogers: I don't really…

John Rogers: care about teaching you anything other than what I've told you about Shelly's case. But if you want, I can give you that same example.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Sure, refresher wouldn't hurt.

John Rogers: Okay.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Thank you.

John Rogers: So… Very basic.

John Rogers: 2A for life.

John Rogers: than 2 is heirs. So, this is a common law concept, okay? It's common law and modern minority.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: What difference… the minority in common law took the approach that there is no difference from this…

John Rogers: to exactly this.

John Rogers: Or two A's aired, whatever.

John Rogers: A2… O2A and her heirs.

John Rogers: Ugh.

John Rogers: There's no difference. The reason is, is because it's to A for life. When A dies, what's gonna happen to A? Like, where does A go when A dies?

John Rogers: That is kind of an arguable point, because I guess it depends on what God you believe in, whatever, I guess? I don't know, who knows? But anyways, A's gone, A is not breathing, and A is not coming back.

John Rogers: So, it's going to go to A's heirs.

John Rogers: A's not gonna live forever, I don't think. So… In this instance.

John Rogers: it's going to A, and then when A dies, it filters to A's errors.

John Rogers: So it has… Carries the same… It's the same thing.

John Rogers: So, in Shelly's case, the rule is, if one instrument, I'm assuming, oh, conveyed by deed or will or something, purports to convey a life estate in a grantee.

John Rogers: And then that same grantee purports to convey a fee-simple interest, In that person's heirs.

John Rogers: The doctrine of merger will couple these together.

John Rogers: And it will then transpose into

John Rogers: O to A, and her heirs.

John Rogers: Or, like, I like iPhone law, as I've told you, so if someone perhaps has an iPhone, then it's just gonna be O to A.

John Rogers: iPhone law.

John Rogers: Do not put that on your final. Do not say iPhone law. Do not say iPhone law, okay?

Amir Akbari: Quick question. For the essays, we just need to have a subheader of merger, then under that, we don't need to have a discussion of merger, but under that, yeah, we just put a share this case and…

Amir Akbari: Discussion of Shady's case, right?

John Rogers: S.

Amir Akbari: Thanks.

John Rogers: Anything else?

SFV Room 216: Oh my gosh.

SFV Room 216: Anybody?

John Rogers: he's scared.

dovenight: I am scared, but I work very hard, I'm overdosed, but… I'mma do my best.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: You'd be okay, don't worry. So just remember something for property, okay?

John Rogers: I know it's hard.

John Rogers: I know it. I know it's hard.

John Rogers: So, write on a piece of paper right now, or get a tattoo! Get a tattoo on your wrist, and say.

John Rogers: That my teacher knows it's hard, so when you open it up… And you think it's hard.

John Rogers: Hey, I know it's hard! I know it's hard, okay? So I will be going into grading knowing that this is hard.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: If you don't think it's hard, Fantastic!

John Rogers: Wonderful. Melting my heart. Okay?

John Rogers: But I just think it should be challenging for most.

John Rogers: If it's not, hey, if it's not bad, it's not bad. Perfect. Maybe you're just really smart.

John Rogers: But I will go into this, Knowing that it is challenging.

John Rogers: And,

John Rogers: I can basically confirm now that the page limit… I think I told you guys it was 25 per essay? I was wrong. I guess it was, I read it wrong. So it's gonna be 10 pages per essay.

John Rogers: I believe double-spaced, so it's 5 pages single-spaced.

John Rogers: When you have a page restriction, again, I'm not gonna grade on organization, anything like that, okay?

John Rogers: Look, I gave an A-plus to a… to a…

John Rogers: To a student, and she wrote, like, one paragraph in a blue book.

John Rogers: Like, it was just one paragraph. All these blue books. She didn't even have, like, an indent, nothing. She got an A. So, I don't,

John Rogers: Hold it against you.

John Rogers: for an organization, I just think that organization is important in the long run.

John Rogers: But it's not going to be important if you have that page restriction.

John Rogers: Now, are you still scared?

John Rogers: So, just remember, I told you what's in the 9th edition. It's not in the 10th edition.

John Rogers: The Real Property Book.

John Rogers: that was assigned to this class that we went over. The 10th edition does not contain an issue, okay? So I had to pull the 9th edition, and I wrote it verbatim from the book.

John Rogers: In the chat, or in the…

John Rogers: In the piece of paper, which you all, can… Review the recording.

John Rogers: And see yourself.

John Rogers: Are there any questions?

John Rogers: Also, it did, was there,

John Rogers: Registration open? A student emailed me, I think yesterday, saying she couldn't get in my class. I didn't even know the registration was open.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, it opened yet.

John Rogers: That was it?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: They just… they just waitlist everybody, and then they release it. People think because it turns yellow, and it says waitlisted that your class is full. But I think yours has a limit anyways, if I'm not mistaken.

John Rogers: Okay. Well, what class? What year is it for, evidence?

William Knight: You're evident.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Awesome.

William Knight: Already.

John Rogers: Oh, is it? Is it cool?

William Knight: Yeah, they… Diana texted us saying, you know, stop trying to submit for us, we'll pick something else.

John Rogers: Oh, so you didn't get in.

William Knight: Well, I'm trying right now to get into a different one.

John Rogers: Oh, man!

William Knight: Ugh.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor, honestly, I want to let you know one thing. I've tried to get into all of your classes, but if I'm not in any of your classes, I'm still gonna join your classes. That's just…

Agnes Gholoonian: I'll just be a shadow in the back. I won't talk or anything like that, but I want to listen to your lectures.

dovenight: Yeah, they said it was full, and I tried to join, and it's like, it went full so quickly.

John Rogers: You guys are melting my heart. Just my heart is melting. It really is melting. But, you know, the evilness has now taken back over, and now it's just liquid nitrogen again. So… but it was really nice while it lasted.

John Rogers: I'm not gonna share my notes.

dovenight: You guys are…

John Rogers: grown-ups. You guys are grown-ups.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): We can get it off the recording.

John Rogers: Thank you. Yes, thank you.

John Rogers: Thank you. Thank you. You all are grown-ups. You all are adults.

John Rogers: But I have to be careful, because I did have a 16-year-old in my class.

John Rogers: Questions, questions, questions. You've got 2 minutes, 2 minutes, 2 minutes for property. I will have more reviews, I'll do 2 more landlord-tenant hypos with you guys. Do whatever you guys need.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So I'm still gonna have no life on the 21st, 22nd, 23rd, and I'll have, make myself available and have sessions for you guys, okay?

dovenight: Thank you, Professor!

John Rogers: Yeah.

dovenight: You're a charismatic professor.

John Rogers: Thank you.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Why are you not teaching property next year?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: You're retiring?

John Rogers: I am retiring from property, so this spring will be… so I've been told, but then maybe I might get an email in May, or call in May and say, hey,

John Rogers: we need you to come back for property. So, we'll see. But as far as I know, I'm out.

John Rogers: I'm out. There's no more property.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: So we're getting the grand finale next semester.

John Rogers: Yeah, yeah, that's right, you'd be getting a grand finale.

dovenight: You're still gonna be teaching other courses?

John Rogers: Pardon?

dovenight: Are you still gonna be teaching other courses?

John Rogers: Yeah, I still teach evidence, and then the school wanted to know if I wanted to propose an elective, and I thought about proposing one, maybe in the summer, it would be federal practice.

John Rogers: So, students would understand the federal rules and stuff like that, so they have an idea of what it's like.

John Rogers: It's definitely different than state court.

John Rogers: So, we'll see.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Which class is your passion? Which one do you like the most?

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): What do you like teaching the best?

John Rogers: Well, I've taught a bar review course, I've taught criminal law, I've taught property, and I've taught evidence.

John Rogers: Evidence I like the most.

John Rogers: Because it's a different style of thinking, and I just think that… It's, it's just different.

John Rogers: It really challenges me more than property.

Agnes Gholoonian: How did you get stuck with property?

Aris Matevosyan: Property got stuck with him.

John Rogers: Yeah. The dean.

John Rogers: said he didn't want to teach property anymore. He says, would you like to take…

John Rogers: Kinda just said we would like to give it to you, and I said, fine.

John Rogers: Oh, I guess it's time we now move into evidence.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Professor, one quick question. I just want to talk about structure and format real quick. I submitted my essay, I don't need you to grade it or read it, but I didn't know if you had a chance to look at it, because I'm really concerned about…

John Rogers: Oh, I don't… can you send it again? Can you send it again to me? Oh. I got a list.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Yeah, sure.

John Rogers: There's a list, and you're not on that list, so send it again.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Oh, crap.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I'll send it again. My biggest question was formatting and making sure that I was making, you know, breaking it down the right way.

John Rogers: Okay.

dovenight: In fact, I did get my, my ESSA, my second ESSA.

John Rogers: I got you on that list, Mr. Mayor.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): I'm submitting right now, I want on that list.

John Rogers: Yeah, I'll take a look.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Thank you.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Do you know if I'm on there also? I sent it, like, a week ago, or less than a week ago?

Nathan Rabiezadeh: My second one.

John Rogers: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

John Rogers: Because sometimes when I get them, I'm, like, in court or something like that, and I'll say, okay, I gotta make sure I log that, and I don't sometimes. Hold on, give me one second, okay?

John Rogers: Because my evidence class is losing patience.

John Rogers: Hold on.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: I sent it November 11th, so now…

John Rogers: Oh, whoa!

John Rogers: No, there's some students ahead of you, though.

John Rogers: So…

Nathan Rabiezadeh: young, though.

John Rogers: Yeah, I'm just trying to find where that list is.

John Rogers: You are not on it. I will put you on it, though, because… no, you're not… nope, you're on it. You're on it. You're on it.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Thank you.

Nathan Rabiezadeh: Appreciate this today. Thank you so much.

John Rogers: Alright, I guess we're gonna move into evidence now.

John Rogers: So, I had a, student text me about an hour-ish ago, and proposed an essay.

John Rogers: I, I have no problem doing whatever it is you guys want to do as far as,

John Rogers: I have no issue with doing any question you guys want to do.

John Rogers: I would prefer to do a question that there's no, like, issue outline, because the ones with, like, the issue outlines, you guys can do those yourselves, okay? Unless it's one of those, like, drunk exams that I told you about, one of those, like, ones where the

John Rogers: Was it… was written by a drunk person?

John Rogers: But I'd rather do ones that, do not contain that outline.

John Rogers: So, does anyone want to propose a question?

William Knight: When did the drug stop occurring, Professor? Like, 2022?

John Rogers: You were digitalized, so, say that again?

William Knight: When did you stop writing them? Like, 2022?

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: But Sebastian's written a bunch, too, so… Doesn't matter.

William Knight: Yeah, okay, fair enough.

William Knight: Why don't we do, like, question, like, 2 or 3 on the 22, then?

John Rogers: I think you guys have an answer to that, don't you?

William Knight: I don't know, maybe I'm not showing up to the right ones.

William Knight: Rs would know.

John Rogers: Oh, he's 23, I think.

John Rogers: Do you have 22?

Aris Matevosyan: I don't think we went over 22.

William Knight: Oh, I don't think so.

John Rogers: Yeah, I think you're right, I think I only gave you 23 an answer, like a student answer to 23.

William Knight: Alright, I can drop it in the chat, Professor.

John Rogers: a student, preferably question two, it's a weird one from ball of…

John Rogers: 22… fall of 2004? So, 21 years ago?

John Rogers: I don't know, can someone drop in the chat? Please drop in the chat.

William Knight: You want to do 20… 2004 or 2022? Which one do you want me to draw off?

John Rogers: Well, I think… a student did ask for a weird question, so I said, fine, whatever.

John Rogers: But why don't you guys battle it out and let me know?

William Knight: Alright, well, I'm.

Nazanin Ayenehchi: Professor, which one do you think is better for our final?

John Rogers: I don't know, I haven't even looked at either of them.

William Knight: Someone's… someone else… can someone else… Professor 2022, I probably sent 2004, but my power is out, so I'm… I'm hotspotting this.

John Rogers: Oh, it's a bummer his power's out.

John Rogers: Okay, fine. So… Okay, well, huh…

John Rogers: Okay, fine, we'll do the 2004 or 2005, whatever. Fine. Let's do that. Doesn't matter.

John Rogers: I think they texted it to me.

William Knight: Alright, I lied, the hotspot came through, I sent you both one, Professor.

John Rogers: So was it, 2000… 5's… Question 2, 2005.

John Rogers: Patty… You represent Plaintiff Patty Pearly White?

John Rogers: Is that it?

John Rogers: Is that it? I don't know.

John Rogers: Early White?

John Rogers: Fine, the murder one with Dwayne! Okay, murder, okay, I like that. Someone died.

John Rogers: So… Fall 2004, Dwayne is charged with the November 24… oh, that's like… on Monday.

John Rogers: Double murder of his wife.

John Rogers: That doesn't make any sense.

John Rogers: That does not make any sense. I'm just reading it now. Sorry, can someone drop it in the chat?

John Rogers: I'm reading it from my phone. Dwayne is charged… here's how this begins. Dwayne is charged with double murder of his wife.

John Rogers: DD… And his girlfriend, Victoria?

John Rogers: It's kind of weird, we got this, like, pronoun thing going on here, you know what I mean? Like, it's a wife that goes by he.

John Rogers: File.

John Rogers: All 2004.

John Rogers: It's in Word.

John Rogers: Stuart Martha.

John Rogers: I think it kind of shows up a little wacky on my computer, but that's fine.

John Rogers: I would think just exposure to any question is good, okay?

John Rogers: This might be one of those drunk ones. I think so. Seems like it could be a drunk one, if you ask me.

John Rogers: Can everyone see the screen okay?

John Rogers: Can anyone not see the screen okay?

John Rogers: If I can begin, make absolutely no sound.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Dwayne is charged with the November 24th

John Rogers: 2004, 21 years ago. Jeez, that was, like, 4 years ago to me.

John Rogers: Double murder of his wife. Okay, so this is just what I'm making sense. The double murder of his wife…

John Rogers: Dee Dee.

John Rogers: Now, Dee Dee could be a male, And… His girlfriend, Victoria.

John Rogers: What the hell's going on here?

John Rogers: Hold on, hold on, hold on. I'm trying to figure this out.

John Rogers: Double murder of his wife.

John Rogers: Am I reading this incorrectly or something? This doesn't make sense to me, right? Unless the pronouns are kind of, you know, we're doing that.

Agnes Gholoonian: I think he killed his wife and his mistress.

William Knight: Yeah.

Agnes Gholoonian: DD and Victoria.

William Knight: of them.

Agnes Gholoonian: One's a wife, one's a mistress.

John Rogers: Okay, I guess… Okay, sorry, I guess I read this wrong.

John Rogers: So, yes.

John Rogers: The wife and the mistress. Okay, sorry.

John Rogers: So, Victoria is victim, Dee Dee is wife, okay.

John Rogers: The prosecution's theory… okay, so this is what they're theorizing.

John Rogers: Now, murder can have different theories.

John Rogers: is that Dwayne, the defendant, Being suspicious that Dee Dee was having an affair.

John Rogers: Okay…

John Rogers: pretended going to work and found Dee Dee and Victoria in bed together? This is getting weird!

John Rogers: So wait, his wife and mistress are together?

John Rogers: So I'm gonna kill them both?

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: pretended going to work, so… Okay.

John Rogers: In the ensuing argument, Dwayne shot at Dee Dee. I shot at her.

John Rogers: I shot at her.

John Rogers: with a rifle, that probably ain't… okay, with a rifle, missed her hitting and killing Victoria.

John Rogers: He then shot and killed you, so… I would think transferred intent, Right.

John Rogers: He then shot and killed Dee Dee.

John Rogers: Alright.

John Rogers: Dwayne's defense is self-defense. Okay.

John Rogers: So, when I see that, I think of this.

John Rogers: He admits to shooting them.

John Rogers: admits.

John Rogers: So… It's almost as if he was the one that fired it, there's no issue with identification.

John Rogers: There's no issue with really anything other than his state of mind, and whether or not one of them or both of them were the aggressor.

John Rogers: Okay? So if he's claiming alibi, who cares? He's claiming self-defense, so anything about an alibi is not going to be relevant.

John Rogers: that Dee Dee found he and Victoria in bed together.

John Rogers: and shot and killed Victoria. It doesn't say where, though, but okay.

John Rogers: and shot and killed Victoria, so…

John Rogers: Dee Dee found he and Victoria in bed together, shot and killed Victoria. Who shot and killed Victoria? Him? Okay.

John Rogers: And then, in the ensuing struggle for the large-caliber handgun.

John Rogers: Handgun. So now there's an issue of what is the type of weapon involved?

John Rogers: It went off killing D.

John Rogers: So… Sorry, guys, but I'm asking for your help, Who shot? Who shot Victoria?

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): Okay, we think that Dee Dee killed Victoria, and then…

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): In a struggle, Dwayne killed Dee Dee.

John Rogers: It's just… self-defense only as it relates to DD, but I am…

John Rogers: had nothing to do with Victoria. I didn't pull the trigger for Victoria.

John Rogers: Fine, I think I'm right. If you think I'm wrong, make absolutely no sound.

John Rogers: The weapon was never found, so we don't know the type of gun. Okay, so…

John Rogers: What would the type… so the prosecution is saying rifle, The defendant is saying, handgun.

John Rogers: So there's obviously a discrepancy there.

John Rogers: At trial, the following evidence was admitted by the trial court after timely objection by the law.

John Rogers: Okay, so the prosecution…

John Rogers: So, the prosecution is trying to prove up the double murder, introduced A or N, audio-video surveillance tape.

John Rogers: Okay, unless there's a statement?

John Rogers: Or assertive conduct involved, fine, that's wonderful.

John Rogers: dated… October 18th, 2004,

John Rogers: Okay, so… It's about 6 weeks before this incident.

John Rogers: Which was confiscated by the police.

John Rogers: from Igor's… weapons of mass destruction.

John Rogers: showing…

John Rogers: The defendant purchasing a large rifle weapon.

John Rogers: And when asked… and when Igor asked Dwayne why he needed such a weapon, why do you need a weapon? Why do you need this weapon? It's none of your business. Dwayne responded…

John Rogers: should… I guess that's supposed to be a quote. I am going big game hunting, and if I find

John Rogers: there is a game going on, then I am hunting.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Gonna go off to women, okay. As… Defendant was leaving the counter.

John Rogers: the tape recorded Igor's comments to his cashier. There goes a guy who's Gunning for someone.

John Rogers: Now… How is this audio or video surveillance?

John Rogers: Relevant to the case.

John Rogers: Anybody know?

Agnes Gholoonian: It suggests that, Dwayne had a rifle in his possession.

John Rogers: Well, yes. I mean, the prosecution's theory is that Dwayne used a rifle.

John Rogers: So, it makes it more probable to their theory.

John Rogers: and less probable as to, I guess, Dwayne's self-defense claim of a handgun.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: I don't see… You could say that the legal relevance, any inflammatory effect.

John Rogers: Prejudicial effect is minimal.

John Rogers: buying a gun? Well, it goes to the prosecution's theory, so it's probative with that regard. So…

Agnes Gholoonian: But what the… what Igor said, wouldn't it be prejudicial?

John Rogers: I think so.

John Rogers: I think so. I don't even see…

John Rogers: I don't even see what Igor said, how that's even relevant.

John Rogers: What about the statement?

John Rogers: What do you guys think?

Speaker 2 (SFV Room 216): Can't that come in a state of mind?

Speaker 2 (SFV Room 216): Ullman?

John Rogers: Yes! See, here's the thing. I am going.

John Rogers: So that is evidence of… Forward thinking.

John Rogers: That's state of mind.

John Rogers: Sure, I like it.

John Rogers: I love it.

John Rogers: But… Is this coming in for a hearsay purpose, though?

John Rogers: Well, I guess so.

John Rogers: That he's actually going hunting?

John Rogers: Fine.

John Rogers: You could bring it in as a hearsay purpose, because it shows that

John Rogers: Fine. You could bring it in for a hearsay purpose. It's fine.

John Rogers: But I do see a hearsay and non-hearsay purpose, but yeah, you could say state of mind, Hillman.

John Rogers: That's forward thinking. I am going. Remember, when you see I am going somewhere.

John Rogers: I am… doing something in the future, going, that's Hillman, that's state of mind, it's forward thinking, okay?

John Rogers: forward thinking.

John Rogers: Do you see anything else?

Amir Akbari: And it could be a circumsplantia right here.

Amir Akbari: like a non-hearsay one. It's more circumstantial, right?

John Rogers: Well, okay, so, first off, state of mind.

John Rogers: Sure.

John Rogers: Anything else?

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): Could this come in as a possible admission by party opponent?

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: It's an admission! The prosecution is introducing… the prosecution is introducing what Dwayne said…

John Rogers: So, the opposing party is introducing what the other party said, which is a personal admission. It's an admission!

John Rogers: It's an admission!

John Rogers: Correct!

John Rogers: That is correct.

John Rogers: There goes a guy who is gunning for someone.

John Rogers: Huh.

John Rogers: Barring a relevance issue, but… how he's interpreting Someone else's state of mind?

dovenight: Ask the question for hearsay? Yeah.

dovenight: Will you, bring in, like, transcript or video camera, videotape. Do you say these are…

dovenight: Who did you write? These are,

dovenight: Not animals, or… these are machines, or something?

John Rogers: Oh, you're thinking of… Is this an assertion?

John Rogers: Machines don't make assertions, but this is an audio and video recording.

John Rogers: So this is human interaction that is making the statement. It's different if it's, like, a radar gun on a… for a police officer, or, like, bank records, or something that's automated, that does not require the use, that is not manually inputted by humans.

John Rogers: But this… Would not qualify as that, because an assertion is being made in here.

dovenight: Oh, okay, so, so, when did you… when do you write, like, as a machine, it can't be,

dovenight: Is that a human or something, when it's a non-assertion?

John Rogers: When it's not… I mean, it doesn't qualify as an assertion. It's because a machine is making the statement.

dovenight: Okay, thank you.

John Rogers: There goes a guy who is gunning for someone.

John Rogers: What do you guys think that should be?

Aris Matevosyan: Would that be a present sense impression?

Andre Hakobyan: Wouldn't this be a non-hearsay purpose effect on the listener? Or reader?

John Rogers: I was thinking… I don't know, I mean, that could maybe be a present-sense impression on an event?

John Rogers: I'm describing I mean, I think it would be worth the discussion.

John Rogers: I don't think it's actually narrating or describing something.

John Rogers: I think it's after-the-fact impression.

Kelly’s iPhone (2): Would it be assertive conduct?

John Rogers: Well, I mean, assertive conduct, it's a statement.

John Rogers: So it's a statement, so that's the statement, so there's some assertion

John Rogers: Perhaps being made here, there goes a guy who is gunning for someone.

John Rogers: I mean, I would think it would be coming in for a hearsay purpose to prove that this guy, Dwayne, is going to go put a bullet into someone. As a prosecutor, that's what I wanted him for.

John Rogers: I just don't see how this is relevant, though.

John Rogers: The only type of…

John Rogers: exception that I could perhaps think of would be present sense impression.

William Knight: Professor, I got kind of a long stretch, and I just want to make sure I'm getting the rule right.

William Knight: Could it be a declaration against interest, or does that require he being charged for something?

John Rogers: A declaration? I mean, is Igor available?

William Knight: No, he's dead.

John Rogers: Where does it say he's dead?

William Knight: The next sentence.

John Rogers: The defense introduced a certified copy of E… God, I hate this.

John Rogers: I hate this.

William Knight: Because he's admitting, as a, like.

William Knight: Gun shop owner selling a weapon to someone who's gonna go kill someone.

John Rogers: In a perfect world, I would read all of this.

William Knight: Yeah.

John Rogers: it all up, but I… I like…

John Rogers: Fine. Fine, he's dead. Sorry, I didn't read this, I thought this was part of question 2, my apologies. So, he is no… he is unavailable to testify.

John Rogers: He is unavailable to testify.

John Rogers: So, could that be a statement against Igor's interest?

John Rogers: excellent issue and find there? Is it against Igor's interests?

William Knight: to admit to selling a gun to someone who he thinks is gonna go kill someone? Yes, I think so. I think that's very much…

John Rogers: Potentially impose liability, right?

John Rogers: Even almost criminal liability, maybe.

John Rogers: I think that'd be a stretch, but I think that opens the door to some level of liability, selling a gun to someone

John Rogers: You believe is going to go put a bullet in someone?

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): I have a quick, question, Rish. Wouldn't that go into knowledge and notice instead?

John Rogers: But… but… It's knowledge.

John Rogers: So… who is having knowledge? Who's getting that knowledge?

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): Having the knowledge that he may or may not go kill someone.

John Rogers: So you're saying that Dwayne's statement is coming in to show knowledge on the gun, the store owner, Igor.

John Rogers: Because if you say, there goes a guy who's running because it says, Igor's comments to his cashier.

John Rogers: So, how does his cashier's knowledge of anything relevant, coming in for what?

John Rogers: Does that make sense?

William Knight: I guess my question would be, if the cashier was, like, Dee Dee or the other woman who died, and he said it to her, then that would be noticed, correct?

William Knight: Like, that's a man who's gonna go kill someone. He says it to one of the people who's gonna get killed. They had noticed that this guy's…

William Knight: You know, maybe…

John Rogers: How is their knowledge relevant?

William Knight: I guess it would only be relevant to the mistress.

John Rogers: But… For what purpose, though? Just that she knew she was gonna be killed?

William Knight: Yeah?

John Rogers: I mean… it would… Maybe be relevant to show fear.

John Rogers: To show that she wouldn't have attacked him, like he claimed in self-defense.

John Rogers: But… don't see it.

John Rogers: But what I see here is the best answer I see is a statement against interest.

John Rogers: It's the best… thing that I could see, unavailable, so it says certified copy of Igor's District.

John Rogers: Dying declaration, no former testimony, no.

John Rogers: But you're known.

Leanna Badar: Professor, it wouldn't be state of mind, Hillman, since someone's going to do something in the future.

John Rogers: But the problem is, is that… interesting.

John Rogers: is that… it's not going. This does not go to Igor's state of mind. It would be… what…

John Rogers: It would be trying to come in to prove what is going on in… Dwayne's state of mind.

John Rogers: And that's… not proper.

John Rogers: Because it's going in to show someone else's state of mind.

John Rogers: You know what I'm saying? It's not a direct statement of what Igor… well, it is…

John Rogers: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

John Rogers: Hold on.

John Rogers: This would be Hillman if… Igor said.

John Rogers: I'm going with Dwayne, gunning for someone.

John Rogers: Makes sense. Not someone else is doing something.

John Rogers: Remember, it's a statement of the declarance forward thinking to do a future act.

John Rogers: But this isn't the declarant.

John Rogers: Doing the act.

John Rogers: It's someone else doing an act.

dovenight: So, it's decorations of interest, because the… The, declare that's debt.

dovenight: Yes.

John Rogers: I mean, he's unavailable.

John Rogers: I mean, look, I'm looking at this because a very smart student pointed this out.

John Rogers: That this person's unavailable.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: The only exception that I can think of here that would match would be a statement against his interests.

John Rogers: And if it's coming in to prove its truth, that someone is… that Dwayne is going to, kill someone, perhaps, then that's the only exception that I could think of.

Aris Matevosyan: Professor, I have a formatting question, if you don't mind. Does it matter, on the essay, if we put, number one, Dwayne's comment.

Aris Matevosyan: And then… or, like, we titled it as Dwayne's comment, and then Igor's comment.

Aris Matevosyan: That's fine.

John Rogers: You can do that, that's fine.

John Rogers: Anything else?

John Rogers: Yeah, so I think that the issues that I see here, potential,

John Rogers: Potential present sense impression, and state of mind, and then this would be a declaration against interest right here.

John Rogers: Now, I don't think that we need to discuss this anymore.

Speaker 2 (SFV Room 216): Don't we need to discuss Crawford?

John Rogers: Well, is this a statement given to a police officer? Is this testimonial?

William Knight: It was confiscated by the police for the investigation, does that make a difference?

John Rogers: No, because when you think of Crawford.

William Knight: Oh, I do where you're… I go, I know where you're going.

John Rogers: and… Almost in substitute for testimony.

John Rogers: So, Dwayne… or even… Igor.

John Rogers: what was the primary purpose? But… Are you saying…

John Rogers: Should we at least discuss it? Is that what you're asking?

Speaker 2 (SFV Room 216): Yeah, cause I thought you would just bring it up, but fail it.

John Rogers: You can, if you want. Let… let's circle back to that, because I would assume

John Rogers: Wait, this is 2004.

John Rogers: Crawford came out in 2004, didn't it?

William Knight: What did they discuss prior to 2004?

John Rogers: I think Crawford came out in 2004.

John Rogers: It was, you should know that, we went over it!

John Rogers: Ohio.

William Knight: They actually had to discuss… oh, my bad, my bad. I didn't know they discussed the prior law.

John Rogers: You don't have to discuss prior law, no.

John Rogers: And in my slides.

William Knight: They did, because then it was current law.

John Rogers: What? Oh, in this, it was current law, yeah.

William Knight: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Yeah, it ended in, 2004, Professor.

William Knight: Crawford v. Washington.

John Rogers: Yeah, 2004. So, this was probably not even thought of at this point. I don't think.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, I don't see this being… a Crawford discussion here.

John Rogers: But hey, if you want to write it, go ahead.

SFV Room 216: Awesome.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): Sorry, real quick. For the… Surveillance tape?

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): This… is this not… I mean, so this is layered, correct?

John Rogers: I don't see it layered, I think it's just a statement to the recording.

William Knight: Can you stop the recording, any questions?

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): from… Dwayne to Igor.

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): and then Igor to his cashier, and then to the recording. And then the recording, couldn't the recording come in as a business record?

John Rogers: I mean, fine. I'm not looking for business record discussion here, to be honest.

John Rogers: a business record, I mean, fine, if you want to write it, it's just…

John Rogers: I'm not looking for it. Wanna talk about authentication of the… sure, I'm just not looking for it. Don't care very much.

John Rogers: I fail to see the layered hearsay here.

John Rogers: It would be layered if it said, I am going big game hunting after Fred told me.

John Rogers: Blah blah blah.

John Rogers: But we just have one recording capturing different statements at different times.

John Rogers: Does that make sense?

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): Yeah, is it not the same as, like, the police report, where someone says something to one person, the other person then puts it in the report? Is that not the same? Like, because it's maybe not someone's putting…

John Rogers: the police report could say this. I spoke to this witness, who said this.

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): Okay.

John Rogers: and the witness said that they spoke with this other person, who spoke with this other person. Then you have to match it all up.

John Rogers: I spoke with this person, who spoke with that person, who spoke with that person.

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): Okay, so because it's… just because it's on the tape doesn't mean that it's necessarily layered, like, from…

John Rogers: I don't see layered here sitting here.

SFV Room 216: Okay.

John Rogers: Dwayne took the stand and testified. Okay. I… drives me absolutely nuts for this, right here, and I guarantee you're probably gonna see it on my question, too. Drives me nuts. Took the stand, why don't you say, Dwayne testified?

John Rogers: Took the stand.

John Rogers: Can't stand that.

John Rogers: So he testified in his own defense.

John Rogers: He testifies in his own defense.

John Rogers: So, let's see what he says.

John Rogers: During his testimony, his counsel, his attorney, introduced a handwritten invoice. Okay, so this is triggering, I would assume, a potential business record, okay?

John Rogers: Potential business records.

John Rogers: October 18, 2004, is that the same time as here? Okay.

John Rogers: So I guess this is in quotes. Purchased from Igor's W. Weapons of Mass Destruction one large caliber handgun

John Rogers: And the invoice is signed by Al Gore.

John Rogers: This is… Glaring business record issue going on here.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Glaring business record.

John Rogers: Notice it says handwritten?

John Rogers: If it's a handwritten, and that's the operation of the business, then that's fine, as long as it's kept written in the ordinary course of,

John Rogers: of, of business. The problem right now, though.

John Rogers: is what? That you can see if this were to try to come in as a business record. What do you see the promoter?

William Knight: Authentication. Authentication because he's dead.

John Rogers: Sure, but it also says Al Gore.

William Knight: I think it's… is that not supposed to say Igor?

John Rogers: Oh, is it?

William Knight: Oh, I just… I don't think there's been another person named Al Gore.

Aris Matevosyan: It has.

William Knight: Right?

Aris Matevosyan: Vice President…

Agnes Gholoonian: It's funny. It's… I think it's a parentheses with the A and the,

Agnes Gholoonian: Whatever that sign is, that A with the swirl.

John Rogers: But,

John Rogers: Oh, signed Igor, okay. Yeah, it's gonna be an authentication issue, but Igor does not have to authenticate it.

John Rogers: As long as it's just the custodian of records or other qualified person.

John Rogers: So, you are right.

John Rogers: You are absolutely correct.

John Rogers: There is an authentication issue.

John Rogers: But the custodian

John Rogers: Oh my god.

John Rogers: Okay, I'm gonna teach you this.

John Rogers: That the custodian would come in.

John Rogers: To authenticate for this to come in, as a business record, okay?

John Rogers: That's an issue. Now, barring what else I read so far, okay? Barring what else I read so far.

John Rogers: Okay?

John Rogers: In the real world, this may come in, but I don't want to teach it to you.

John Rogers: Dwayne testified to having seen Igor prepare and sign the hand

John Rogers: and hand to him the invoice, okay? So I could… I can… so he can authenticate that…

John Rogers: He wrote it, But there still needs to be the custodian or other qualified person.

John Rogers: Other evidence… Jesus.

John Rogers: Other evidence established that the state penal code, penal law.

John Rogers: Requires that all retail gun dealers have a third-party witness.

John Rogers: Sign all gun sale invoices.

John Rogers: Did we have a case on this?

John Rogers: Not to this exact.

John Rogers: So the question, though, is,

John Rogers: First off, If something is mandated by statute, does it… is it part of the business?

John Rogers: business requirement.

John Rogers: If it's mandated, though.

John Rogers: State mandated.

John Rogers: Is that…

William Knight: Yes.

John Rogers: done in the ordinary course of business. We had a case on that in business records.

William Knight: Yes.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: So… Okay, so first off, this handwritten invoice How is this relevant?

John Rogers: How was…

William Knight: It goes to show that he had…

SFV Room 216: Oh, go ahead.

William Knight: weapon.

William Knight: The weapon for, perhaps, the crime.

William Knight: And this confirms it.

John Rogers: the… it goes to show the weapon for the crime? What do you mean?

William Knight: That he had the weapon.

John Rogers: Well, this is the defense bringing it in, so why would the defense want this to come in?

Speaker 2 (SFV Room 216): Isn't it coming in sh… Gun, not a rifle, because the process…

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: Yes!

John Rogers: Look, it's a… handgun!

John Rogers: The prosecution's theory is a rifle.

John Rogers: Whatever it is.

John Rogers: large caliber handgun, okay? So it's kind of matching his story in a way, right?

John Rogers: Kinda like Dwayne.

John Rogers: Joke! Kidding, just kidding.

John Rogers: So this is supposed to be Igor, not Al Gore, right?

William Knight: Yes, supposed to be Igor.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: And I'm assuming this would want to come in for a hearsay purpose to prove the sale was of this

John Rogers: handgun.

John Rogers: So… it looks like… This is a bulky discussion of a business record.

John Rogers: But I still think it's problematic, because it's not certified.

John Rogers: So, this is going to fail because there's no custodian or other qualified person to testify to its authenticity.

John Rogers: For example, is this made in the ordinary course of business?

John Rogers: How do we know?

John Rogers: The custodian or other qualified person did not testify to that.

John Rogers: Make sense?

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): Professor.

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): Is it possible that this could come in for a non-hearsay purpose, for a state of mind? Because he's saying, like, what happened at the time, but then it would fail because it's a fact remembered? Could you at least bring it up and then fail it?

John Rogers: What's the statement?

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): that he testified that he said… or that he saw Igor prepare that and sign the hand… and then hand him the invoice.

Speaker 1 (SFV Room 216): Or is that too much of a stretch?

John Rogers: No. I don't see it.

John Rogers: I don't see that.

John Rogers: Business record.

John Rogers: a business record.

John Rogers: I don't see anything else we potentially could Use here.

John Rogers: Agent admission.

John Rogers: I don't see it.

John Rogers: to writing.

John Rogers: It's a writing.

John Rogers: So you think to yourself, I'm writing it.

John Rogers: Writing?

John Rogers: We've got writings, we've got business records, public records.

John Rogers: Past recollection recorded.

John Rogers: The problem is that if Igor is dead, it can't qualify because, one.

John Rogers: He's not available to testify to it, and two.

John Rogers: He'd have to refresh his recollection.

John Rogers: So, unless someone's a gifted doctor or spiritualist, Igor ain't coming back.

John Rogers: Sorry.

John Rogers: Only thing I can see here is a business record discussion, and it looks like it would be a very bulky discussion, in my opinion.

Amir Akbari: I have a question here. The fact that, they…

John Rogers: Okay, go ahead, go ahead.

Amir Akbari: The fact that the third-party witness didn't sign the invoice, it doesn't negate the, if they… if they do that business, without that signing. If they do it

Amir Akbari: Right?

John Rogers: What are you getting at?

Amir Akbari: I mean, authentication, in the authentication for the, in ordinary course of that business, they do, without, signing the party witness, third-party witness, right?

Amir Akbari: Even it's illegal, even… but it's qualified to come in if we find that exception.

Amir Akbari: They do in this way, on that business, on their…

John Rogers: You're getting somewhere as far as trustworthiness.

John Rogers: Is this trustworthy?

Amir Akbari: Yes.

John Rogers: If it didn't comply with state law, you're gonna have a trustworthiness issue here going on. Is this document trustworthy?

Amir Akbari: Yeah, but if they do, like, a hundred of them the same, that's gonna be their ordinary.

John Rogers: course of business? Sure. Yeah.

John Rogers: But what I'm thinking of is that if it's a violation of state law, the statement

John Rogers: Does that qualify as a declaration against interest? Or a statement against interest?

John Rogers: On its face, it doesn't seem to be a statement against their interest.

John Rogers: It's just extrinsically, you'd have to show that it…

John Rogers: Was, because there's a latent defect.

John Rogers: Because there's… someone had their hand raised?

William Knight: Yeah, I do. Is the fact that they mention state law here enough to tell us that maybe we should be using, like, CEC codes versus FRE?

John Rogers: I don't think so.

William Knight: Okay, cool.

John Rogers: I would think that that's a really interesting issue, because it's…

John Rogers: Is that a declaration against their interest?

John Rogers: Igor's interest.

John Rogers: on its face, it's fine. It's just a gun receipt, but if it wasn't executed pursuant to state law, that could be against his interests. That's a very interesting issue. I'm gonna note this for future…

John Rogers: evidence classes. I thought that's very interesting.

John Rogers: So I would probably put a question mark, because I honestly don't know.

John Rogers: I don't know.

John Rogers: My representation to you is… I would think that it would be…

John Rogers: I think that would suffice to be a declaration against his interest.

John Rogers: And let me tell you why.

John Rogers: If…

John Rogers: Many people say I was just in the car.

John Rogers: Or something like that. During a shooting.

John Rogers: You didn't admit to shooting, but you were in the car, and extrinsic evidence is to show that there was, in fact, a shooting, which implicates you, which is against your interest.

John Rogers: So, my thought on this is that this would qualify as a statement against interest, not on its face, but you'd have to extrinsically show that there was no third-party witness.

John Rogers: that signs the… oh, wait, hold on, hold on, wait, wait, hold on. Other evidence established that… that the state law, Pena law, requires all retail guns to have a third-party witness sign all gun sales invoices. Yeah.

John Rogers: So, if there is no third party.

John Rogers: Then that would be against his interest.

John Rogers: The problem, though, and this is a really Bearcat issue, because…

John Rogers: It's not Igor, I would assume, it's…

John Rogers: This is the business. So the third-party witness could be Igor.

John Rogers: So it raises a lot of issues. You guys all following this?

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor, this may be a little stupid, but would you discuss the fact that on the, let's say on the tape, that there was no mention of

Agnes Gholoonian: Any written receipts, because there was another cashier there.

Agnes Gholoonian: that Igor then turned to and talked to. So, the authenticity of the written hand receipt that Dwayne has submitted.

John Rogers: I think it may have happened right in here.

Agnes Gholoonian: But do… If there's a cashier, why would he write the receipt?

John Rogers: Yeah, I don't know.

Agnes Gholoonian: Would… would you discuss that in the, in the essay?

John Rogers: You know, that's very interesting. I don't know.

John Rogers: I mean, there was someone certainly available to sign, and it didn't comply with state law.

John Rogers: The problem is, what is a third party?

John Rogers: Because it's the business that is selling

John Rogers: It's the business selling the gun.

John Rogers: is Igor… a third party.

John Rogers: Maybe?

William Knight: So then there'd be 2 points, like, 2…

William Knight: trees, you know, forks or whatever of discussion. If you

William Knight: that Igor is a third party to that, then the business record could come in and you wouldn't make… This is separate from business record.

William Knight: No, no, I know, because now you can make a statement against interest.

John Rogers: Yes, I'm talking about statement against interest now.

William Knight: No, no, but that also means that he doesn't violate the state law, so that… would that not help state… would that not help with business record?

John Rogers: Oh, you're right, as far as trustworthiness, yeah. But look, the fact that it's included in here, I guess it's fair to infer that, look, it didn't comply.

John Rogers: So, I don't know. It doesn't necessarily mean that it was, or it's just other evidence established that the state law penal interest requires. Okay, fine.

John Rogers: But that doesn't mean that this did not comply with it.

John Rogers: Because Igor himself could be a third party. Because it's the business selling the gun, not Igor. This isn't in Igor's garage when he's selling his private gun.

John Rogers: Make sense?

John Rogers: But yeah, I guess you could incorporate into business records as far as trustworthiness. There's just a lot of unknown here, to be honest. You don't know.

John Rogers: No clue.

John Rogers: But I do think that that's very creative, and I actually might want to use that

John Rogers: in subsequent years. So, when you guys are long gone in your career, maybe…

John Rogers: Future hotshots will get something like this.

John Rogers: Interesting.

John Rogers: I don't see anything like this on your final, though, okay?

John Rogers: I don't think there's anything like this on your final, because this is Bruce Schwartz, and Bruce Schwartz has a tendency to just kind of throw people off.

John Rogers: And just see what people say.

John Rogers: So, there's nothing like this on your file, okay?

John Rogers: Now, I'm burning daylight because you guys keep talking so much.

John Rogers: So, the prosecution introduced the testimony of Detective Friday.

John Rogers: Friday. My favorite day's Monday, actually.

John Rogers: who testified that on O, That is coming up this Saturday.

John Rogers: who testified that on November 22nd.

John Rogers: Victoria, so one of the victims, Visited the police station.

John Rogers: She visited the police station, so this was 2 days… before the murder.

John Rogers: And that during his interview with her.

John Rogers: She told him that she and Dee Dee were afraid of Dwayne.

John Rogers: All right.

John Rogers: and were concerned about what he would do if he learned that she and Didi were romantically involved.

William Knight: Just, how was that?

John Rogers: relevant.

Agnes Gholoonian: Victoria's State of Mind and Dying Declaration.

John Rogers: I wouldn't go as far as saying dying declaration, but yeah, state of mind, we got some state of mind going on here. But how is it relevant?

John Rogers: Exactly.

Agnes Gholoonian: Oh, it proves their, Dee Dee and Victoria's relationship.

Agnes Gholoonian: And, supports the prosecution's theory.

John Rogers: that Dan, that Dan intended… intended to kill them, Upon learning of the… Their intimate relationship.

Agnes Gholoonian: Yeah.

John Rogers: Okay.

John Rogers: So, it's Detective Friday.

John Rogers: Okay, so hold on. Detective Friday… From Victoria.

John Rogers: So, it's kind of a multi-layered, because it looks like it's what Dee Dee also told her. So, Dee Dee told Victoria what Victoria told Friday.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: Kind of.

John Rogers: It's definitely Victoria to Friday.

John Rogers: But it's arguable about whether it's Dee Dee to Victoria to Friday. See what I'm saying?

Agnes Gholoonian: Oh wait, but then that can't be state of mind, because Victoria can't… use Didi's phrase, or Didi's…

Agnes Gholoonian: Words to prove… proof of mind.

Agnes Gholoonian: Well… It's only the declare.

John Rogers: Or… what Dee Dee told Victoria could go to Didi's state of mind, right?

John Rogers: And then what Victoria told.

John Rogers: But yes, as far as.

Amir Akbari: Format… it could be format testimony for the… what Victoria said to the detective.

Amir Akbari: Because she's unavailable, and also, she had a cross-examination on the…

John Rogers: when did Victoria testify?

Amir Akbari: Before… Before the fight, right?

Amir Akbari: It should be after.

John Rogers: Hurt testified.

John Rogers: Victoria never testified.

Amir Akbari: Hmm… Did you do that?

John Rogers: No, where does it say Victoria testified?

John Rogers: So, I think that… to go to…

John Rogers: any statement from Dee Dee to Victoria is likely gonna show Dee Dee's state of mind of fearful of Dwayne.

John Rogers: And I think that is relevant because it…

John Rogers: It's a double-edged sword, but it could help prove up that Dwayne was not acting in self-defense if they're afraid of him, but it kind of could if you're afraid, maybe you could attack someone.

Agnes Gholoonian: Professor, but I thought… When it comes to proving state of mind, a declarant statement

Agnes Gholoonian: It's only admissible if it's the declare and statement, but not… Oh, wait, hold on.

John Rogers: Yeah, I know what you're getting at, so here's the thing.

John Rogers: There's… there's two ways to look at this.

John Rogers: How do you get DD's statement to Friday.

Agnes Gholoonian: You'd have to find an exception between.

John Rogers: Victoria, And Friday. And you can't.

John Rogers: So all you can establish is perhaps DD to Victoria. So DD's statements, if there are any, will not be admissible.

John Rogers: Because we can't find an exception from

John Rogers: from Victoria to Friday, as it relates to DD statements.

John Rogers: Victoria, on the other hand, about her being fearful, would go to her state of mind.

John Rogers: to the detective. So the detective is simply testifying to the state of mind of… Victoria only.

Agnes Gholoonian: Butter.

dovenight: Well, this is a layer hearsay. How many layer hearsays? Three.

John Rogers: No, I only see two, but the problem, though, is that it may not necessarily have to come in for a hearsay purpose, it could come in to show, non-hearsay, just that they're afraid of, of Dwayne.

John Rogers: but getting

John Rogers: Dee Dee's fear to be admitted is very problematic, whereas it is much easier to get Victoria's fear admitted, because there's less hurdles, as I just said.

John Rogers: Anything else you guys hear?

John Rogers: Nadia, do you see something here now?

John Rogers: Yeah, it's a Crawford issue. That is a major Crawford issue going on here. Major Crawford issue. Yee! Yes!

John Rogers: This is a major Crawford issue. We have someone giving a statement to the police.

John Rogers: Right?

John Rogers: Primary purpose of providing statements for potential future prosecution that they are fearful.

dovenight: This is not an… this is not an emergency.

dovenight: Where is he?

John Rogers: No.

John Rogers: I don't see that there's any ongoing emergency.

John Rogers: Period.

John Rogers: So you'd establish one. Victoria is unavailable because she's dead.

John Rogers: 2.

John Rogers: Her primary purpose, it's testimonial.

John Rogers: Maybe 3? No prior opportunity to cross-examine.

John Rogers: It's not coming in.

John Rogers: Big issue here, you cannot miss this. Can't miss the Crawford here. Almost looks like that's really what it was all about.

John Rogers: And I have exceeded that hour by 8 minutes. I'm so sorry.

William Knight: No, you're gracious.

John Rogers: somewhat helpful.

John Rogers: Okay, I will find an essay, and we can do it, so we don't have to do those wacky ones.

John Rogers: I'll find one to do. But, I'm looking at probably this Friday and Saturday, and instead of having, like, a long review, maybe I should just do 2 hours, 2 hours, 2 hours. So 1 hour for property, 1 hour for evidence, 1 hour for property, 1 hour for evidence. That should be good, right? Three essays?

John Rogers: Right.

John Rogers: Maybe.

John Rogers: Who's scared for this final?

John Rogers: So if you're not scared, make absolutely no sound.

Roy Armin: No comment.

John Rogers: Dude.

Andre Hakobyan: Oh, it's good.

John Rogers: Yeah, I… My question is number one. Sebastian's questions is number two and three. His questions are very short.

John Rogers: Maybe half a page total?

John Rogers: Stuff going on in there?

John Rogers: But, I think my question is kind of straightforward.

John Rogers: I think so.

John Rogers: I… I think so.

John Rogers: But… I don't know, just text me when you're done, let me know, that way I can,

John Rogers: That way I can just know.

Alice Orozco: Professor, did you say in class that one, essay is gonna say saw, but they meant… it meant to say heard?

Alice Orozco: I think that's what you mentioned.

John Rogers: And, you know what? That's my question, because, I'm not gonna say who doesn't know how to write.

John Rogers: So, what I do is I say, I wrap up the exam, I send it to someone.

John Rogers: And they say, hey, can we talk about it? I say, no, I'm too busy. And they say, can I make a quick adjustment? I say, yeah, go ahead, no problem.

John Rogers: And then it's submitted.

John Rogers: And then I find out… There's a couple of errors.

John Rogers: I'm not gonna say who it is, because it wouldn't be fair to Professor Sebastian, but I can't say who it is.

John Rogers: it's Professor Sebastian. So, in mine, he wrote something that was, like.

John Rogers: It should say herd versus… it's not going to change anything.

Alice Orozco: Got it, you're gonna be okay, you're gonna be okay.

John Rogers: Sure.

John Rogers: He'd be… he'd be fine.

John Rogers: But, so I'll still… a couple things. I'll still have a review Friday and Saturday and Sunday.

John Rogers: Our property, our evidence. Our property, our evidence. Sunday, hour of property, hour of evidence. You do not have to attend. You have better things to do, go do your better things, okay?

John Rogers: I think that those would qualify as a makeup class, because makeup classes, for evidence, is based on hours, it's not based on actual class sessions.

John Rogers: I don't know approximately what time, but, I don't have any plans next weekend, so I'm probably not doing anything Friday night.

John Rogers: So…

John Rogers: Maybe we can all go on a date together, a virtual Zoom date, you know, and just have a fun-filled night of property and evidence.

John Rogers: That'd be heaven.

John Rogers: So, I think that our makeup class… would be… Fine.

William Knight: With those being the makeup class, though, then, doesn't that make them not optional?

John Rogers: They're optional. I mean… You know, Mr. Knight, you talk too much.

William Knight: Yeah, evidently.

John Rogers: You're gonna be fine.

John Rogers: And then last…

John Rogers: But not least, I'll email you guys. I will not have an evidence class this week.

John Rogers: I will not have a property class on Thursday. No evidence Wednesday. No property on Thursday. I cannot do it. I have…

John Rogers: conflict, so Friday, Saturday, Sunday, they're optional, you don't have to come.

John Rogers: Last but not least, I do have a question for some of the students. As far as next semester in evidence.

John Rogers: And if you've taken me for property, I… as you know, I usually give out PowerPoint slides.

John Rogers: For evidence.

John Rogers: Do you want me to create, like, a notes outline, like I do in property, for evidence?

Ja'Nise Company: Yes.

Aris Matevosyan: Yes, please.

John Rogers: So, I… the problem is, is I don't want to do both, So…

William Knight: or property.

John Rogers: Wait.

John Rogers: What?

William Knight: We said you did.

Ja'Nise Company: The one you did for…

Roy Armin: It sucks to be property, though.

William Knight: Yeah, it really sucks to be property, man.

John Rogers: No, I would… It sucks to be property.

John Rogers: No, they'd still get it. No, he's…

Aris Matevosyan: He doesn't want to do both.

Roy Armin: Oh, cause you said you don't want to do both.

John Rogers: Point slides AND my notes.

John Rogers: I don't want to do both.

Ja'Nise Company: Take your notes.

John Rogers: my slides would just repeat what the notes say, and, you know, I'll still get questions of, can you repeat that? Or, like, you know, what was on that last slide?

John Rogers: And that's what drives me nuts.

John Rogers: That's what… really… Gets me very mad.

John Rogers: So, do you guys want that, or not?

John Rogers: because I'll probably color coordinate it like property, because in my property, I have minority, majority, all that kind of stuff, and I've got the rule in there for you guys.

John Rogers: what do you guys want? Because for Evidence 2… No.

John Rogers: Okay, fine, I'll do the notes. Alright, we'll do the notes. With the understanding, with the understanding that if you ask a question that could be found in those notes, I have every right to destroy you when you ask that question.

Ja'Nise Company: What were all the days?

Roy Armin: Would they be equally as depth?

John Rogers: Excuse me?

Roy Armin: Would they be equally as in-depth? Like, if we picked either… oh, okay.

John Rogers: Yeah.

Alice Orozco: Are you still gonna be doing the ACE briefs, or we're just gonna…

Alice Orozco: Like, how are you gonna include that in the notes?

John Rogers: I have really, like, I never called on anyone this semester.

John Rogers: So what do you think I should do? I've given you the case briefs.

John Rogers: What do you think?

John Rogers: Should I make you guys do it?

astrinakoshkaryan: We'll leave it up to you, Professor, you're the expert.

John Rogers: Oh, I am, because, you know, I am really smart, too, and I'm perfect, flawless, in every way.

John Rogers: Thank you for reminding me.

John Rogers: Yes, hand raised.

Aris Matevosyan: I have a question, Professor, regarding number 3. I know you're over your hour, but, just real quick, what would… what would it, make

Aris Matevosyan: What would make that testimony admissible if…

Aris Matevosyan: Would it be if Dwayne cross-examined DeeDee?

Aris Matevosyan: Or Victoria… Victoria?

John Rogers: Well, then it would have to come in under former testimony, and there is no former testimony.

John Rogers: So, Crawford says, a testimonial, if the witness is unavailable, And this statement is testimonial.

John Rogers: It's inadmissible unless the defendant had Prior opportunity cross-examine.

Aris Matevosyan: What's the prior opportunity? That's what I'm getting to, I guess.

John Rogers: Think of it kind of like former testimony.

Aris Matevosyan: So then you… you mentioned former… but then that's an exception to Crawford, right? Former testing?

John Rogers: That's what it says, unless the defendant had an opportunity to cross-examine.

Aris Matevosyan: So, on the essay, you would write confrontation clause, and then the rule analysis, and then you'll go on to…

Aris Matevosyan: The exception of… Former testimony and write.

John Rogers: Forget it, forget it, don't get confused. Alright.

Aris Matevosyan: Bye.

Aris Matevosyan: I'll just write a big…

John Rogers: focused more on unavailability, and is it testimonial? You need to know about testimonial is that

John Rogers: it's not always clear what it is. There's no, like.

John Rogers: clear rule statement for it. So it's in, Sometimes in dispute.

John Rogers: So that's usually the crux of it. Thank you. Is something testimonial.

Aris Matevosyan: Thanks a lot.

John Rogers: Man, it's raining cats and dogs out there.

John Rogers: Any other questions?

John Rogers: Somewhat helpful. A little bit, kind of?

Aris Matevosyan: Very… thank you, have a great weekend.

John Rogers: For the Sebastian students, what did you guys go over your last class? What did you guys do?

John Rogers: Do you guys know how to make a sound? I guess you guys know how to say things?

Agnes Gholoonian: He canceled his last class, so we don't… I don't remember.

John Rogers: Oh, he canceled, so you guys haven't gone over, like, essays or anything like that?

Agnes Gholoonian: We did two essays, I think?

John Rogers: If I'm not mistaken. I wonder which ones, so I can… Not potatoes.

Agnes Gholoonian: I don't remember.

Agnes Gholoonian: I have to go through my notes.

John Rogers: And, by the way, if you guys have registered, do you guys know if I'm registered to teach on Tuesday or Wednesday? No one told me.

Ja'Nise Company: Wednesday.

John Rogers: Wednesday?

Nazanin Ayenehchi: And Thursday.

John Rogers: Yeah, I'm gonna go… I'm gonna go to the park with my laptop and hang out on a park bench. That's what I'm gonna do today.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Perfect movie day, you can go down to the movies.

Jon barton (Student: UWLA & Pepperdine MBA): Go have a beer?

astrinakoshkaryan: Professor, quick question. Which, which elective did you say you were considering for summer?

John Rogers: Federal practice… Which would be both criminal and civil.

John Rogers: It's kind of like,

John Rogers: Some students may practice in federal court.

John Rogers: So maybe it's kind of an introduction of what happens,

John Rogers: Maybe, like, you know, what the procedure is?

John Rogers: how… how filing systems, all types of stuff like that. So it would probably be, like, credit, no credit. It wouldn't be, like, a graded class.

John Rogers: Like…

astrinakoshkaryan: Thank you.

John Rogers: Yeah.

John Rogers: So, but I just don't know if students would have an interest, because

John Rogers: Look, 90% of lawyers don't practice in federal court.

John Rogers: So…

astrinakoshkaryan: I think if you're teaching it, unfortunately I won't be able to take it because I'm done with my electives, but you are really popular because

astrinakoshkaryan: We got emails on who was in the class and who wasn't, because they capped your class, and also Professor Sebastian's.

John Rogers: Sebastian's is capped, too, this quick?

astrinakoshkaryan: Yes, both of… both of your classes are capped.

John Rogers: But he has 2 classes.

astrinakoshkaryan: Yes.

Mireille Meguerditchian: Evidence and property are kept.

John Rogers: news.

Mireille Meguerditchian: And we were all fighting over you.

John Rogers: Hahaha! Alright.

John Rogers: Yeah, but look, you're not in my class, you don't want to be in my class, that's totally fine, doesn't matter. You can always attend, watch the videos.

John Rogers: So, they're available to everyone.

John Rogers: just contact Mauricio and say, can I have access to the recordings? And you'll get them.

astrinakoshkaryan: It's a different experience in person, Professor.

John Rogers: Yeah, I don't like it.

John Rogers: That's why the… that's why the AC is at 62 degrees.

Mireille Meguerditchian: Are you trying to get us to not come?

John Rogers: We'd like to have less in-person classes next semester.

John Rogers: A lot less in person.

John Rogers: But next semester is going to be hard.

John Rogers: It's gonna be hard.

John Rogers: I think harder than this semester, to be honest.

John Rogers: Double the amount of information, I think.

John Rogers: Agnes, I think I heard that sigh.

Agnes Gholoonian: Oh, sorry.

John Rogers: That's okay.

John Rogers: I think she's scared.

John Rogers: Anything else, guys, or am I done?
